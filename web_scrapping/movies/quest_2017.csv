...a story worth telling, but due to a lack of context and poor directing, that story is executed in the most boring manner possible.|Rotten
Ordinariness-and [Jonathan] Olshefski's ordinary, level-headed approach to documenting their life-is the keynote of this intensely moving and involving film.|Fresh
Quest is one of those great movies that captures the turbulent currents of American life by zooming in on a single household.|Fresh
Things happen - some severe, some less so - and life goes on. And always there is Olshefski, a one-man film crew who captures it all and distills it for our narrative pleasure.|Fresh
It may be impossible not to be moved by the goodness, grace and dignity displayed by the Raineys as they weather challenges.|Fresh
At a lean 90 minutes, Quest never drags, but it's also begging to be extended into that update of An American Family which, for some reason, has never materialized.|Fresh
... we rarely see such lives depicted in a straightforward yet affirmative fashion, lives that are no less important than the marquee ones we obsess over.|Fresh
The political lens is unavoidably sharp, but the embedded filmmaker captures moments of strength and support, crises that mark the health of their children, neighbourhood resilience, and the nourishment that hope requires in this working-class community.|Fresh
The finished documentary is a meditative study in the everyday realities of poverty, gun crime, and racism, whilst offering a moving portrayal of people united by love and affection.|Fresh
Director Jonathan Olshefski stumbles on a profoundly bittersweet testament to the human condition. At once universal and specific, Quest is a truly American story.|Fresh

A mesmerizing portrait of a North Philadelphia family over a tumultuous decade.|Fresh
By offering a deeply relatable prism through which to experience...the nuclear American family, Quest is both a mirror and a window, showing both symptoms of our culture and the ways in which individuals subvert and redefine them.|Fresh
it's the flawless mix of personal and political that makes Olshefski's film indisputably great|Fresh
Quest closely portrays faces of America that are all too ignored.|Fresh
Quest offers a haunting glimpse of a lower-income family's resilience under extreme pressure.|Fresh
There are stretches of Quest that are tough to watch, and others you might never want to end.|Fresh
The randomness is what's so stunning; one moment life is flowing placidly, then its course is cruelly changed.|Fresh
Christopher, Christine'a, and P.J. are beautiful to watch together, and there's hope in witnessing them persevere - in an underserved neighborhood, against shifting political tides, beset by the random cruelties of fate.|Fresh
"I've rarely seen a movie about citizenship as quietly eloquent as ""Quest."""|Fresh
[A] tender, humane, gently probing film ...|Fresh
When the final credits roll, it's heartening to know that people like the Raineys, the backbone of this country, are thriving in the face of great odds.|Fresh
There are biographical documentaries, fortunate to the point of being blessed, that start as fly-on-the-wall journalism and luck into better-than-fiction narrative twists. The remarkable Quest is one of them.|Fresh
You might get a more authentic representation of this family only if you actually sat inside their home.|Fresh
Filmed over the course of approximately a decade, this powerful and poignant picture moves well beyond its original niche.|Fresh
... a quietly moving story of resilience.|Fresh
This is loving, humane, substantial stuff, with the richness of a fat novel rather than the sensationalism and cruelty of reality TV.|Fresh
It is a rare fly-on-the wall documentary that doesn't generate some ethical dilemmas. Olshefski had chosen his subjects well.|Fresh
Quest meanders somewhat, but is compelling in parts and gives a fascinating insight into the shocking iniquities of a deeply divided nation.|Fresh
I'm not sure how many Americans will ever see this movie, but the more the better.|Fresh
Amplifying these voices is the film's definitive quest.|Fresh
Quest makes it clear that some things endure beyond political events.|Fresh
A ten-year labour of love, culled from more than 300 hours of intimate observational footage, Quest is a documentary with a seemingly banal remit but it bristles with cinematic urgency and dramatic power.|Fresh
This is Olshefski's first feature and it is a tribute to his deep connection with the Raineys -- and what must have been a mammoth editing process by Lindsay Utz -- that the film unfolds with such grace over the years.|Fresh
A brilliant exercise in subtlety and honest documentary making.|Fresh
Quest may be one of the most important films about the American experience ever filmed.|Fresh
Olshefski illuminates the rich, strife-filled lives of these extraordinary people.|Fresh
The genius of Quest is that-perhaps much like life-you're never quite sure where it's going to go.|Fresh
The subtle but striking documentary follows the family for nearly a decade; we watch as spectators to the Raineys' everyday life as they deal with illness, tragedies, surprises and the joys of life.|Fresh
[A] living, breathing, stunning documentary study of an African-American family in North Philadelphia weathering a tumultuous decade.|Fresh
Olshefski's love of the family shines bright and proves infectious.|Fresh
There's a great documentary in Quest, but this is a case of a film that's trying to cover too many things, and thus only muddles its own intentions.|Fresh
'Quest' is a film with a bit of surface flash - the family's patriarch Christopher is an aspiring music producer/promoter - but that element aside, this is very much a portrait of a regular family. Regular, yet seldom seen in mass media.|Fresh
Recalls Steve James' Hoop Dreams in both the way it captures people over a long period of a time and in how it finds the profound in the everyday, the universal in the specific.|Fresh
Timely and timeless ... The sooner you can see it for the first time, the better.|Fresh
Once again, the Steve James model of long-term filming commitments pays off: By the end of Quest, I felt melancholy about saying goodbye to the Raineys and sad that I wouldn't know where their lives would go from here.|Fresh
A sweeping and intimate documentary about the struggles of an average American family.|Fresh
The documentary Quest does something so simple and, given our times, something miraculous: It takes us into the lives of a family to show our commonality, not our differences.|Fresh
"Jonathan Olshefski's ""Quest"" is nothing if not timely, and the resulting symmetry to the narrative (which commences with President Obama's campaign in 2008) is deeply satisfying."|Fresh
