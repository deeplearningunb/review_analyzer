The imperative to eradicate any hint of bossiness or anger from her character weighs heavily on the film, threatening to turn it into one long, dispiriting exercise in allaying male fears about powerful women.|Rotten
Congrats to Patty Jenkins and everyone involved for finally giving me a blockbuster I actually cared about! Thank you!|Fresh
Wonder Woman not only fulfils all the criteria of a superhero movie but is also engaging, exciting and inspiring throughout|Fresh
Gal Gadot absolutely rocks as the mighty Wonder Woman, as well as the sweet and compassionate Diana. It's not just the best DCEU film so far, it's a solid and hugely entertaining film, period.|Fresh
Some aspects of the story are also a bit over the top, but then again, it is a superhero movie. Overall, go watch it.|Fresh
The opening act drags with exposition and the climax slips into the same fire and brimstone mixtape so beloved of DC. But that status also buys it an inspiring, revolutionary spirit that your average neighborhood superhero film can only dream of.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is smart and engaging, funny and fun; there's far more humor and heart here than in any other DC offering.|Fresh
Director Patty Jenkins knocks it out of the park with this film.|Fresh
We've never had a superhero film directed by a female director, and after what Jenkins has delivered, this clearly needs to change immediately.|Fresh

Like Zeus breathing life into the world creating man, so does [director Patty] Jenkins breathe life into the DCEU.|Fresh
It isn't groundbreaking in structure, but its exhibition of strong female heroism amidst conflicts of the past just elevates everything...|Fresh
A nuanced message of hope and mercy in a violent world? A superhero motivated by love and a desire for peace? A visionary portrayal of femininity in all its beauty, complexity, and strength? I'm with her.|Fresh
This is an exciting moment for women all over the world, make no mistake. But the outdated source material hinders Wonder Woman from reaching full-out beast mode.|Fresh
With the disappointment of Batman vs. Superman and Suicide Squad, DC proves they may have found their magic again.|Fresh
"It's not really possible to fully divorce Wonder Woman from the fact that its simple existence feels like a big, revolutionary ""event"" in and of itself."|Fresh
Easily joins the ranks of some of the best first outings for a superhero in the last two decades.|Fresh
Jenkins has a keen eye for the action sequences, staging some elaborate moments stylistically. With the help of Gardot's performance, there is humanity in this character that has been sorely lacking in [DC movies].|Fresh
Wonder Woman is undeniably the strongest entry in the ever-expanding DC Extended Universe.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is not just the first great female-led superhero movie ... but an astounding example of modern blockbuster filmmaking in general.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is unmarred by the cynicism, grim and gritty attitudes, and humorless self-seriousness that have plagued the early entries in the DCEU.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is not just the best film in the [DCEU] to date. It isn't just one of the best origin stories to date. It's simply one of the best superhero films made, period.|Fresh
It merges the best parts of Thor and Captain America into an origin story possessed with increased character complexities despite its generic plot.|Fresh
"If you are still in the camp of ""DC cannot get it right"", I implore you to take a chance on Wonder Woman. Diana Prince is more than a demigod with the power to bring down the mighty. She's the hero we deserve."|Fresh
The sappy romance might be a bit much for some, but there's a sense of optimism and play in Wonder Woman that feels invigorating after the dismal death wheeze of more recent DC efforts.|Fresh
With the film on-course for a stellar opening weekend ... the period superhero movie proves itself to be a exciting and entertaining entry to the DC cinematic universe|Fresh
The refreshing superhero film the DCEU desperately needed.|Fresh
Wonder Woman has greatness to it -- because of its hero, because of its spirit, and because it is done absolutely right.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is far from a perfect film, but it's brave and smart enough to be granted a well-deserved sequel.|Fresh
Patty Jenkin's Wonder Woman is an entertaining, exciting film. I was surprised by how refreshed I was that Wonder Woman was a good person.|Fresh
This is Diana's journey, and it is a beautiful and affecting indictment of the kind of people who have power yet can move through the world without using those powers for good.|Fresh
This film is very much the hero's journey, end-to-end, and it did such a good job that I forgot it was doing that. I was just lost in the story.|Fresh
As a summer blockbuster with blistering action, charm to burn and plenty of potential, it's a hit.|Fresh
"""Wonder Woman"" lives up to its hype, and DC Comics' example of a strong, independent, fit woman is something to support."|Fresh
"Her journey in realizing that humans have a darkness and light in them is a tough lesson to learn, but her continued belief in that light is nicely done. Superhero fan or not, ""Wonder Woman"" is worth seeing."|Fresh
The performances, the plot, the music, the art direction -- everything about this film is movie making at it's best.|Fresh
The energy here is warm, unmistakably feminine, and the balance of light-hearted humor and melodrama sets this production apart from the somber, alpha-male brooding of its DCEU predecessors.|Fresh
Bad news, haters: Wonder Woman is good.|Fresh
It's told very well sans clumsy clutter and the pacing is perfect. Jenkin gets high marks for humor and for the delicate handling the romance between Gadot and the charismatic Pine who,... almost has you rooting for him to win.|Fresh
With director Patty Jenkins at the helm, Wonder Woman was in the hands of someone who was more than capable of doing Diana's story justice.|Fresh
Wonder Woman flips nearly every gendered superhero trope it encounters.|Fresh
Bottom line: The movie is terrific, just the breath of fresh air Warners needs.|Fresh
Wonder Woman sits, as she should, both with the pantheon of great heroes, as well as above it.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is the superhero movie that I've been waiting to see and, I suspect, after a string of critical failures the one DC wanted to make.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a terrifically fun movie, deftly balancing action sequences and emotional beats. Gal Gadot is charismatic as the eponymous anti-war Amazon princess.|Fresh
The script by is unusually introspective|Fresh
While the future of the DCEU still remains very much in doubt, at least most will agree that the first major female-led superhero movie in years is a rousing success.|Fresh
Watching Wonder Woman felt like breathing out a sigh of relief.|Fresh
I just really liked seeing a superhero that WANTS to be a superhero in a superhero movie.|Fresh
It represents a clear-eyed view of the world.|Fresh
There are some problems with pacing...but the movie as a whole has a lot of good payoff.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a solid piece of work, well worth watching, and hopefully a harbinger of better things to come from DC in the near future.|Fresh
Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman.|Fresh
A strong entry in the comic-book superhero action film genre, with a plot that's compelling without being confusing, great special effects, strong villains, some inspirational 'girl power' scenes, crisp pacing....|Fresh
[Gal] Gadot is particularly memorable as the lead character here.|Fresh
First and foremost, this is a fun film from start to finish, with gorgeous visuals, an amazing score and perfect pacing.|Fresh
... Wonder Woman is an improvement over the recent onslaught of oft-tedious comics-based movies.|Fresh
I'm confident Wonder Woman is one of the best superhero movies ever made. I can't wait to get back to the theater and watch it again.|Fresh
It's not difficult to see where this route is going, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable to watch. The simple power of love is the cornerstone upon which Wonder Woman is built. If it seems earnest, it's because it is.|Fresh
I felt empowered and I'm not wonderful or a woman. You can view Wonder Woman and her first solo entry movie as a feminist icon, but honestly, it's so much more than that. She inspires us all to be more caring and better to one another|Fresh
It's thrilling that Wonder Woman is enjoying the critical and commercial success that it is. But, in some ways it's also unfair. There is more weight than one film by one director about one woman should bear.|Fresh
Gal Gadot's perfect blend of battlefield courage and uncomplicated compassion provides a formidable champion we have fun rooting for.|Fresh
The Wonder Woman that we needed... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Wonder Woman Lives Up to the Hype|Fresh
Wonder Woman is alive and in command in ways the other DCEU films can only dream about. It is, in short, heroic.|Fresh
This is undoubtedly the strongest DCEU outing till now, one that will add a new world of (female) fans to the franchise, and for all the right reasons.|Fresh
"Gadot, who almost stole last years ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" is outstanding here as the Amazon goddess who not only learns about her destiny but that of her people."|Fresh
[Chris Pine's] chemistry with [Gal] Gadot is sparkling. But this is film is all about Wonder Woman. And Gadot looks like she was born to bring this legend to life on the big screen.|Fresh
[Wonder Woman's] greatest mert is to reinvent all the genres it touches from a woman's perspective. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Wonder Woman"" just isn't that good of a movie"|Rotten
A ponderous film that contains the Michael Bay esthetic beneath a thin veneer of faux feminism.|Rotten
Despite its flaws, Wonder Woman is every bit as epic as Batman v. Superman or Suicide Squad, yet has the humanity and emotion that those movies sorely lacked, despite being smaller-scaled.|Fresh
It's the film that might just turn Gal Gadot into a real film star. She's touchingly good, bringing a genuine emotional depth to a part that, in others' hands, could easily have none at all.|Fresh
There is great pleasure in the matter-of-fact way Jenkins and Heinberg make points about chauvinism, sexism, and equality through pointed humor and practical examples, and how deftly Diana sweeps aside all attempts by men to dismiss her.|Fresh
Amid stunning visuals, well-crafted action sequences and a decent plot, Gal Gadot's nuanced performance speaks volumes.|Fresh
DC Comics should send a huge thank-you hamper to Patty Jenkins.|Fresh
... stands on its own as an action-packed, enjoyable piece of escapism.|Fresh
Wonder Woman may boast a pair of great leads, but thanks to a lackluster script, the film ultimately suffers too much from glacial pacing, an uneventful and oddly structured storyline, and a tedious final battle with a forgettable villain.|Rotten
While I'm not a big fan of superhero movies, Petty Jenkins' Wonder Woman proved to be entertainingly in its own unique way.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is an exciting and welcome addition to the DC live action universe. She is strong and smart and capable-and also exceptionally beautiful, but it is the former qualities that are given the greatest focus.|Fresh
The new Wonder Woman from director Patty Jenkins has an effective story, borrowing fictional archetypes while offering something original.|Fresh
But this attempted revamp of the boys-club superhero genre dares to suggest that a person of conscience might put her invincible physical prowess to better use by seeking to end the carnage of warfare, not just fight to win.|Fresh
Now that Wonder Woman's backstory is finally on the books, let's hope the filmmakers can come up with fresher installments in the future.|Fresh
A correct film, effective, with some problems in its development, but it's the most laudable that DC has done so far. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
All considered, director Patty Jenkins has crafted a film that is about to unexpectedly revive the maligned reputation of the DCEU on the big screen, and it couldn't have arrived at a better time.|Fresh
As befitting the genre, Wonder Woman is heroic and spirited. The fighting sequences are spectacular, and the story is engrossing, uplifting and fun. There's even a bit of romance and humor amid all the action. [Full review in Japanese]|Fresh
The No Man's Land scene is everything, literally absolutely every last thing that every comic book movie should always be aspiring to.|Fresh
Gadot claims star status, handling the title-character with charm, sincerity, finesse and a look that exudes beauty and good health.|Fresh
More than a superhero movie, this is an adventure film, and a really, really good one.|Fresh
"Wonder Woman is not a ""woman's movie,"" but an action film with incredible relevance."|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a thrilling start.|Fresh
"""Wonder Woman"" lifts the oppressive darkness that has been the signature of the DC universe since Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy - both tonally and visually."|Fresh
Gal Gadot has a talent for making every experience feel like it's her first - which, in Diana's case, it often is. She is remarkably alert. Her eyes and her face are always open; she's always receiving, learning, responding.|Fresh
This adaptation is very exciting.|Fresh
Our heroine leaps through the air, spinning like an arrow, but the action has so little weight, emotional or otherwise, that one feels nothing.|Rotten
an exuberant fantasy with a genuine conscience that stands apart from so many other similar films in its willingness to embrace goodness, decency, and an unironic belief in the power of love|Fresh
If superheroes are supposed to be heightened versions of ourselves at our brightest and darkest points, then it is no wonder women are appreciating this character on screen... recognizing such duality in their own lives: that of object and agent.|Fresh
[Wonder Woman is] hugely entertaining and provides a gripping origin story for the iconic female superhero.|Fresh
Until the battering finale, production designer Aline Bonetto and Jenkins focus the action so that even in the ravages of no-man's-land, the sound and fury signify something.|Fresh
A great accomplishment of its director Patty Jenkins, who shows that it has the necessary talent to take care of a blockbuster of this size. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The most obvious issue here is an absurdly, needlessly overlong running time of 141 minutes (!)...|Rotten
A film that has values that are interesting enough and different from the rest to make us smile. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A well-intentioned film that in an age of cynicism dares to recapitulate the importance of the primeval ideal of a superhero: the discovery of inspirational models and escapism. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
So we have the formula: a good character, good sequences of action and a good story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Wonder Woman is not just exciting to watch -- she Wonder-fully undermines DC Comics' endorsement of vigilante justice and glorified bloodshed.|Fresh
That optimism [is] what makes Diana Prince a real superheroine, and it's that vision that makes Wonder Woman a movie that really thrills. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"The film is full of ""you go, girl"" moments designed to please the genre's long-neglected female demographic. Yet Diana seems far more confident than the film's director, Patty Jenkins...as a narrative the film is over the shop."|Fresh
'Wonder Woman' is good, but not as much as I expected after so much praise. Maybe that's why I've focused more on its weak points when the truth is that I came out quite satisfied to see it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film with a magnificent period recreation, a fantastic staging and an exiciting climax. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Wonder Woman isn't placating audiences with its representation. It's using that opportunity to address larger injustices. It may not be perfect, but it's an encouraging step in the right direction.|Fresh
Breathes life into a dying cinematic genre.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is easily the best DCEU movie so far and the best superhero movie since The Winter Soldier.|Fresh
It's two-thirds of a terrific picture, and I'm hard pressed to think of a recent movie I was enjoying so much that s**t the bed quite as spectacularly as this one does.|Rotten
"Wonder Woman is a ""suspension of disbelief"" movie."|Fresh
We shouldn't underestimate the opportunity the film faces: to be a feminist rescue mission.|Fresh
One of the few superhero movies to pass the Bechdel test with flying, bullet-deflecting wrist bracelets.|Fresh
What really makes the film, however is Diana's spiritual journey. Coming from an isolated, simplistic society into the greater world, she discovers for herself the complex, diverse nature of people. This spiritual journey is one worth taking.|Fresh
Wonder Woman moves like a '40s adventure story at times, with a hero-or in this case, heroine-realizing there is a greater sense of duty and service that calls for her to take her head out of the sand.|Fresh
"As boring and flavorless as a three-day-old grilled cheese sandwich that's been left out in the sun, ""Wonder Woman"" is yet another reminder that the superhero genre is a lost cause."|Rotten
"""Wonder Woman"" is sturdy. It's expensive. Its star, Gal Gadot is winning and hard-working. And yet, what's up on screen is dutiful and derivative and, frankly, a bit dull."|Rotten
DC Comics gives us a heroine to follow and applaud. Gal Gadot combines beauty, intelligence, ingenuity and the tenacity of a compassionate warrior in her princess Diana. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a deeply sincere superhero film, but not in a self-important way.|Fresh
Hits the superhero sweet spot between new and familiar, funny and exciting, romantic and heroic.|Fresh
When Trevor insists on traveling to England to consult with 'the men' he says are in the best position to end the war, Diana's response obliterates the gender gap: 'I am the man who can.'|Fresh
Flashback lurches into tedious flashback, while in the interim, blurs of jerky, chopped-up action and CGI explosions fill the spaces where you might have hoped for credibly choreographed battles.|Rotten
Here, DC gets its first good movie. Jenkins has come up with a star that can hold the attention of the audience better than any superman stuffed with steroids. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In short, Wonder Woman is a wonder.|Fresh
Jenkins rises above the pressure and brings a solid, interesting and humorous story to life. Wonder Woman brings light to the darkness of the DCEU, literally and figuratively.|Fresh

For Wonder Woman girls can cheer without feeling a hint of fear. And guys can also shout'Hooray' when Wonder Woman saves the day!|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a perfect reflex of its time. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
As Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot cuts an iconic figure throughout, each purposeful stride a symbol in motion.|Fresh
Gadot carries the movie by combining the charisma of a demigod with the personability of Indiana Jones; even when she's fiercest, empathy and humor are never far away.|Fresh
A long, long overdue movie, given our taste for superheroics, Wonder Woman deserves to be a hit. All the things that go right here overwhelm the few that don't.|Fresh
Just fantastic from top to bottom...|Fresh
Although the film follows a somewhat traditional script, it also deviates -- because superheroing while female is a radical act.|Fresh
A movie with a good romantic rapport by Gadot and Pine, a solid secondary cast and a dramatic idea contained in Allan Heinberg's script. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Patty Jenkins brings a refreshing clarity to [Wonder Woman], a productive mix of gravitas and winking.|Fresh
There are too many villains, none of them dramatically strong enough to be much of a threat, and the most interesting characters get killed off too soon.|Rotten
This is a proper introduction to a superhero who was brought on so lamely in Batman vs. Superman, and the good outweighs the bad here, on balance.|Fresh
The film is successful for what it is because it's directed by a woman. It's worth considering the nuclear-grade disaster this could have been with a guy at the helm.|Fresh
Everything about this joyful, sincere origin story feels like a retort - a very welcome and much needed one - to traditional male-centered superhero stories.|Fresh
From the powerful confidence of [Gadot's] action scenes to moments of emotion and comic relief, it's already near impossible to imagine anyone else in this role.|Fresh
Gadot's Princess Diana is the full nascent-superhero package: youthful idealism, a body so perfect you'd swear it was a special effect, and some mystical backstory for a third-act revelation.|Fresh
The action is solid enough and the effects, of course, are impressive, but the [Wonder Woman] lacks imagination.|Fresh
This elaborate and expensive epic is worth it for star Gadot.|Fresh
By the time we reach the Western Front with Trevor's rag-tag secret agent squad, Patty Jenkins has so deftly juggled period rom-com and epic fantasy elements that even trench warfare barely dampens the momentum.|Fresh
With strong characterisation from a largely committed cast, coherent action and a rare confidence in its mise-en-scène, Wonder Woman is a comic book movie the way they should be done.|Fresh
Wonder Woman provides an example of female power that the world needs. Both girls and boys need to see women on-screen just as powerful, if not more powerful than men.|Fresh
Wonder Woman has come to save us from ourselves in her long, long, long overdue cinematic debut. And in the best news of all, the wait was worth it.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a positive symbol, but the ideology of the movie itself is fuzzy and somewhat disappointing.|Rotten
"""Wonder Woman"" is a great action movie, full of adventure and light drama, similar to films like Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"". [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Top action choreography, a fine cast and a side order of fish-out-of-water camp that director Patty Jenkins serves next to wartime derring-do and Diana's gritty grace is why it succeeds.|Fresh
An elegant but intellectually timid film.|Rotten
Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Heinberg have created an unassailable icon, one who fits into the pantheon with ease, and stands out like no other.|Fresh
DC finally breaks its long losing streak with a satisfying effort- and all it took was changing absolutely everything (Splice Today)|Fresh
Wonder Woman doesn't walk away from her first film unscathed, but Jenkins mostly gets it right, focusing on grandeur, virtue, and sheer butt-kicking excellence, supporting a hero who's truly heroic.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a damned good superhero movie, because it remembers to just be a damned good movie.|Fresh
Here, in her own surroundings -- and playing with contrivances that include the character's magic bracelets and Lasso of Truth -- Gadot truly appears to be a legitimate movie wonder.|Fresh
Unlike most silly fantasy superhero movies, this one is not set in a fictional locale with fictional characters. No, it's Wonder Woman winning WWI! It is the same intellectual diarrhea of all the others, only worse, minimizing the horrors of WWI.|Rotten
"What stands as the film's most surprising revelation is how timely ""Wonder Woman"" feels at moments when approaching themes of war and human kind. It taps into a sensitive spot that speaks volumes today."|Fresh
"""Wonder Woman"" gracefully ascends into the arena and defiantly delivers a stylish, funny adventure made with heart. After the genre shaking ""Logan"" and the genre redefining ""Wonder Woman,"" there's only one thing left to be said: your move Marvel."|Fresh
A superhero origin story infused with the spirit of feminist adventure, and told with smarts, heart, and a different point-of-view.|Fresh
"No matter how the ""fairy tale"" really happened. Some unknown named Gal Gadot was chosen for instant stardom. And she deserves it! Director Patty Jenkins was finally released from Hollywood jail."|Fresh
This Wonder Woman will be inspirational to a new generation of young girls looking for a role model who is both physically strong and endlessly compassionate at the same time.|Fresh
...smartly feminist without making too big of a deal out of it.|Fresh
After the offensively stupid Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman feels nothing short of revelatory.|Fresh
In common with Diana, there is a genuine wonder at work here. We rediscover the tropes of genre through her questioning eyes. And for once, the comic-book movie almost seems fresh again.|Fresh
Wonder Woman's relative innocence and absolute conviction make for an endearing and formidable hero.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a very likable movie. But it was also a very likable movie when Marvel made its kissing cousin, Captain America: The First Avenger.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is the right movie at the right time -- and for all the right reasons.|Fresh
Loved Gadot. The script and supporting actors/characters not so much.|Rotten
Wonder Woman is the most refreshing comic book movie in years, if not ever. Smart, witty , fun and Gal Gadot shines along with Chris Pine.|Fresh
As a period piece made in the spirit of an old-fashioned matinee, Wonder Woman (like the first Captain America) does not have to exhibit the insistent, grim-faced dystopianism that afflicts the recent Superman/Batman movies.|Fresh
To be honest, the fight scenes go on too long and the CGI is laid on a bit thick. It isn't necessary. Gadot's magnificent heroine is enough of a wonder woman in her own right not to need it.|Fresh
Visually dazzling pop culture superhero movie.|Fresh
It only took two women to right a ship that dozens of male D.C. executives, writers and directors, have tried their damnedest to sink.|Fresh
Jenkins and company understand superheroes should have a purpose other than brooding.|Fresh
The beautiful message of Wonder Woman is that attributes commonly associated with women - compassion, empathy, and protectiveness - are the most awesome superpowers of all.|Fresh
While the film descends into the usual pyrotechnical showdown late on, it's watchable, well made and not excessively violent overall, which should make it suitable for older children.|Fresh
Finally, DC got it right -- Wonder Woman is a thrill ride that's entertaining from beginning to end.|Fresh
[It's] surprising to watch the dynamic shift in performance she delivers throughout the film, as the naive and optimistic Diana is slowly faced with the undeniable darkness in mankind. Perhaps most importantly, Gadot is also [funny].|Fresh
Wonder Woman does something special: It gets real. In a genre sometimes overly fond of black-and-white heroes and villains, this film forces its heroine to confront moral grays.|Fresh
After her long struggle to the big screen, Wonder Woman makes the most of her first solo effort.|Fresh
is wondrous -- an origin story about a superhero not driven by loss and vengeance but an innate sense of what's right.|Fresh
It has some resemblance to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), but Jenkins doesn't fall into the propagandistic discourse of saving America, but focuses on nurturing, humanizing and affirming the leadership of his heroine. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A[n] armoured shoe-in for the most pleasantly stunning feature of the summer (or year for that matter), Wonder Woman is everything you could have ever expected from a Wonder Woman movie.|Fresh
Invests Princess Diana with possibly the most genuinely heroic characterization of any modern cinematic superhero.|Fresh
An entertaining film with a more sincere, heartfelt and sympathetic energy than its peers - of the best that DC has created in its bewildering attempts to imitate the Marvel model. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"It's no small relief that 'Wonder Woman' is a decent piece of pop art, messy and unsuccessful in spots, yes, but engaging nonetheless, and an almost incalculable improvement on its predecessors in the ""DC Extended Universe."""|Fresh
Sorry boys. Wonder Woman is the hero the DC universe deserves, and the one it should believe in.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a great yarn, done very well.|Fresh
I've got no subtweet with Wonder Woman, ninety percent of its running time being nothing less than sharp moviemaking. Yet the true and lasting fun will be to witness its eddying cultural influence upon younger generation|Fresh
Wonder Woman gives this long-ignored heroine the coming-out party she truly deserves.|Fresh
With a story that moves at a steady clip and action that threads the needle between realism and supernatural exaggeration, Wonder Woman is the arrival of a hero for all of us, but young women in particular.|Fresh
Boldly optimistic, this action-packed adventure breathes fresh life into the DC universe with a welcome balance of comedy, flirtation and a sense of righteous justice.|Fresh
It's impossible to imagine a better Diana Prince/Wonder Woman than Gal Gadot in Patty Jenkins' lively Wonder Woman.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a great movie by any measure, but it's at its best when it embraces and embodies the universe-defying potential inside the heart of every little girl.|Fresh
Wonder Woman downplays Diana's pursuit of destiny in the fight against evil...Diana, like her introductory movie, has childlike enthusiasm but no passion.|Rotten
Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman gets a chance to shine in her own Hollywood movie. Gadot makes a pretty fine job of it too, bringing a bit of soul and empathy to the proceedings, but sometimes it's more despite than because of the production surrounding her.|Fresh
The film puts in much simpler words the human and feminine (even feminist) discourse already seen in The Force Awakens with Rey, who, like Diana, has to sacrifice, fight and learn before reaching the final goal. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Jenkins delivers Wonder Woman's origin story and although it's uneven and overlong it finds humor, humanity, and an appealingly old school sense of honor in its title character.|Fresh
If Wonder Woman is a sign of what is to come from DC, it's a very good sign.|Fresh
The action is crisp and thrilling, but more importantly, it's meaningful... In fierceness and sheer badass fighting prowess, Wonder Woman is a match for the other heroes in her franchise. But in courage and certainty, she tops all of them.|Fresh
A satisfying and heroic film that doesn't pretend or prove to be anything more. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Thanks to Gal Gadot's truly wonderful breakout performance and Patty Jenkins' robust direction, Wonder Woman proves worth the wait.|Fresh
Jenkins delivers a superhero movie that's better than those helmed by her male predecessors who weren't Richard Donner or Christopher Nolan.|Fresh
From start to finish, Wonder Woman is an origin story that is faithful, thoughtful, and streaked with exciting action and impressive stunts.|Fresh
I was waiting for Gadot. Now that she's arrived, she was all the Gal I could have hoped for... Jenkins creates a hero who loves without fear. She understands the difference between Wonder Woman and the spandex heap of extraordinary others.|Fresh
"""A trailblazer and a gamechanger."""|Fresh
Have no doubt, this movie does Wonder Woman justice, as well as her fans.|Fresh
Wonder Woman has what many other action films (and superhero films) are missing: talented, chemistry-cast leads; exciting action; and thrilling villains to antagonise our heroes.|Fresh
If you can forgive the ending, like I have, and love Diana for her inspiring character, the righteousness of her spirit and also the mad slo-mo action, this film will lasso you right in.|Fresh
Smart, funny and tremendously exciting.|Fresh
Patty Jenkins... working from a surprisingly deft script from Allan Heinberg, has gone and given us a Wonder Woman with a lot more than WW's bulletproof forearm bracelets on its sleeve.|Fresh
Engaging, entertaining, empowering superhero adventure.|Fresh
It means so much, especially in today's world, to watch a woman who is allowed to be naïve, curious, sensitive, and strong save the day.|Fresh
It's disappointing because Wonder Woman deserves better.|Rotten
"""Wonder Woman"" is a thing of hope and beauty; it'll give you a lump in your throat and make you want to cheer."|Fresh
It's a great superhero movie by any yardstick. But, more significantly, it's a great Wonder Woman movie, capturing the compassion and optimism that sets her apart from her brooding fellow SuperFriends.|Fresh
Gadot is a gift to a genre that was long past the point of beginning to feel seriously depleted.|Fresh
While it is not the best superhero movie I've ever seen, it's one I wish had been around when I was a young comic book nerd, and one I hope every girl, nerdy or not, gets to see.|Fresh
Gadot is hugely appealing in the role. She and Jenkins have leaned toward Christopher Reeve's first Superman as a model for how to play the role: strong but innocent, a fish out of water.|Fresh
Many big ideas are juggled, and while the story doesn't exactly drop them, it does flail about a bit. Still, Jenkins has an eye for moving moments, Gadot is great fun to watch, and there's genuine visual panache to be found amid the combat and comedy.|Fresh
This is the first DC Comics movie that mostly has the look, feel and energetic aura of a Marvel film. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a different kind of superhero film.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a fresh, invigorating entry into the superhero film genre that finally lets a woman take center stage-and the results are excellent.|Fresh
Gadot radiates the goodness without sentimentality or wide-eyed winsomeness. Supergirl she ain't. SuperGal she certainly is.|Fresh
The real strengths of this production are its lead actors, the period piece setting, and an unexpected emotional resonance that one doesn't expect from a popcorn movie.|Fresh
When 'Wonder Woman' is good, it is compellingly fun. But when the Amazonian warrior is shown for the 37th time in mid-air, slo-mo battle pose, it is a yawner.|Fresh
The most fun I've had at the theater so far this year.|Fresh
"Don't be fooled. ""Wonder Woman"" may look like just another superhero movie --- but it's not. It's a tour-de-force by Gadot, not to be taken lightly."|Fresh
Gadot more than lives up to the challenge, and is as good at delivering her lines as she is handling a magical lariat.|Fresh
Enthralling, suspenseful, thrilling and refreshingly witty. A much-needed breath of fresh air. Bravo to Patty Jenkins! Note to Hollywood: please hire more women to direct blockbusters.|Fresh
In a movie filled with striking imagery and visual effects, one of the most empowering shots is of Diana emerging out of the trenches, ready to fulfill her destiny and rewrite received Hollywood wisdom on a woman's place in the movies in the process.|Fresh
"Gadot's contribution to the film cannot be understated. She brings a sense of innocence and conviction to the role that's reminiscent of Christopher Reeve's approach to the Man of Steel in ""Superman: The Movie."""|Fresh
Wonder Woman is funny, exciting and fun, but more importantly, it's touching and inspiring. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Within its clichés and action sequences with inexplicably outdated effects, the film tells a solid story of maturity. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I have missed heroism in the big screen like Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. Pure, without cynicism nor sarcasm, full of goodness, wanting to do the right thing. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The only wonder regarding this movie is that it could be so incredibly dull. I keep hoping DC will find a key to unlock the magic inherent in its great cast of characters.|Rotten
Wonder Woman, director Patty Jenkins' immensely satisfying origin story of the Greek Amazon warrior reared on a mist-shrouded isle, boasts the nonchalant humor and heroics, if not the breakneck pace, of Raiders of the Lost Ark.|Fresh
Gadot does succeed, against heavy odds, in creating a fresh figure of heroic morality and might, engaging an audience with an earnest character's discovery of herself and the world.|Fresh
Wonder Woman has action, humor and heart, as well as strong performances across the board, especially from Gadot and Pine.|Fresh
There is an engaging, old‑school feel to Wonder Woman, a film that has some of the sincerity and charm of the early Christopher Reeve Superman epics.|Fresh
Patty Jenkins proves what a talented director can do with a superhero movie. She and Gadot also contribute touches that only women can.|Fresh
An origins story that's earnest yet fun and exciting without being grandiose.|Fresh
Gadot ... exudes superhero charisma, which powers her through a clichéd last chapter.|Fresh
The balance is tipped toward the positive by the fact that the plot rattles along merrily, taking us from the wilds of Themyscira (Paradise Island for us old-timers) to wartime London, the trenches of Europe and more.|Fresh
It's a bird ... it's a plane ... it's a DC movie that doesn't crush your soul.|Fresh
Wonder Woman might not be the greatest thing ever, but it is a damn fine film, and full admission: I spent a good chunk of it honest-to-God misty eyed.|Fresh
What makes Wonder Woman work so well is the character of Diana herself, who's written and performed with the kind of emotional intelligence that's rare in these kinds of films.|Fresh
"Suffering Sappho! Patty Jenkins' ""Wonder Woman"" is that rarity: a superhero movie with a heart."|Fresh
Gal power whips up a roaring adventure.|Fresh
Gadot and Jenkins convey a much-needed sense of excitement and adventure to a group of movies that seemed to be suffocating on their own gravitas.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a cut above nearly all the superhero movies that have been trotted out over the past few summers.|Fresh
"Remember when superhero movies were fun? ""Wonder Woman"" does."|Fresh
Except for the title, Patty Jenkins's big-hearted blockbuster doesn't use the name Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman is singular. Wonderful women are manifold, and hopefully they'll fill theaters alongside some wonderful men|Fresh
This is a movie about battling evil that pauses to ask what evil is and whether it's necessary to understand its nature in order to defeat it.|Fresh
The film's strengths far outweigh its flaws, combining moral and emotional authenticity with superhuman stunts and a lively sense of fun: everything you want from a PG-13 superhero movie. It also feels undeniably fresh.|Fresh
There's so much to like about Patty Jenkins' long-awaited Wonder Woman that I understand those who've gone off the deep end praising it.|Fresh
So when are Jenkins and Gadot teaming up for the next installment? We can't wait.|Fresh
Filled with the kind of humor and earnestness that [the last couple DC films] were criticized for lacking, Wonder Woman is an absolute joy to watch, thanks in large part to its two leads.|Fresh
Wonder Woman succeeds because it understands the character. Not only that, it lets her shine in an origin story that may hit familiar beats at times, but is driven by great character work, a clever script and two great leading performances.|Fresh
Finally.|Fresh
Powerful, empowered and driven by purpose, Wonder Woman is the superhero movie we need right now. It's also a blast of summer-movie entertainment that should charm fangirls and fanboys alike -- along with anyone who likes having a good time.|Fresh
In a world of comic-book movies populated with sarcastic, jokey superheroes dropping witty one-liners with every move, Wonder Woman is a blast of fresh air -- an earnestly heroic character bringing goodness and love to a violence-ravaged world.|Fresh
This latest entry into the DC Comics world is only partially successful before eventually succumbing to genre fatigue.|Rotten
The character of Wonder Woman enters the almost exclusively male domain of DC comics movies... Under this pressure, Jenkins comes through with a work that radiates confidence and sangfroid.|Fresh
Fuel up the Invisible Jet. You're in for a ride.|Fresh
We can overlook how the third act yields to the blows-up-good formula of blockbuster franchises. For now, let's just celebrate a superhero movie that runs on estrogen rather than testosterone.|Fresh
The real success of the film is that Gadot is perhaps the cinema's best-cast DC-style aspirational superhero since Christopher Reeve's Superman.|Fresh
The moviegoing world deserves the best that Hollywood can deliver, and this time we've pretty much got it.|Fresh
Unlike Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad, Jenkins' film isn't about the heroes beating the villains - it's about the humanity of its eponymous heroine.|Fresh
Much credit should go to Godot, who can be alluring, tough, goofy and sweet all in the same take.|Fresh
What makes this a must see for fans of superhero movies is the performance of Israeli actress Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. This is a star-making turn...|Fresh

It's so great to see a film pay off in a way that will please both its hardcore fans and a general public that has been clamoring for it for decades.|Fresh
The best DC film since The Dark Knight.|Fresh
The movie does drag a bit during that midsection after Diana bids farewell to the Amazons, but it's consistently entertaining, buoyed in no small part by [Gadot's] presence, which makes the mythological seem possible.|Fresh
The cinematic universe of DC Comics finally hits all the right notes -- bullets, bronze, and mustard gas included -- in what for any other superhero would be a distinctly Marvel origin story.|Fresh
[A] torpid, overlong DC Comics epic ... puts the first world war on a baking tray for the latest cook-till-crisp superhero flick.|Rotten
This film makes the character one of the more engaging, empowered, and empowering of the recent crop of super-powered heroes. It's a pretty good movie, too.|Fresh
Gadot proves she is worthy of Wonder Woman's tiara, but the superhero deserves a great film, not one that's just better than the others.|Rotten
The only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the-woods innocence and mouthiness.|Rotten
Hopeful, empowering, and enormously entertaining, Warner Bros. Pictures' Wonder Woman is the feature film this iconic female superhero deserves.|Fresh
Even in its weaker moments, Wonder Woman honors the scale of a superhero who stands alongside Superman and Batman in the DC lexicon, but has never had a vehicle worthy of her.|Fresh
For roughly half of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, 'Wonder Woman' is a better-than-average superhero movie; a pity it falls off so precipitously in the last act.|Rotten
A Wonder Woman film that is inspiring, hopeful, blistering, and compassionate, in ways that honor what has made this character an icon.|Fresh
She's fearless, whip-smart and she's just saved the Universe. After three false starts, director Patty Jenkins has delivered the first great film in the DCEU.|Fresh

Wonder Woman is grandly entertaining, offering up a hero whose sincerity reveals a sense of decency and self-sacrifice our modern world could use to learn a little from.|Fresh
An enjoyable adventure because of its two strong leads, its effortless tonal shifts and its aversion to narrative traps.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is easily one of DC's best movies, but it also belongs in the conversation of best comic book origin movies period.|Fresh
It's a winner! Every bit the Amazonian warrior princess, Gal Gadot leaps onto the screen in a smartly written girls' own superhero adventure with an appealing mix of action, romance, humour and spectacular effects.|Fresh
At long last: we can rank a DCEU superhero movie over some of the best the MCU has to offer... and actually mean it. Here's all you need to know: Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman.|Fresh
She does not disappoint.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is glorious.|Fresh
Unlike lots of comic book movies, it feels like a work of passion and vision. I sense a filmmaker behind it, not a focus group.|Fresh
"""Wonder Woman"" has raised the bar. Now let's see if the boys can clear it."|Fresh
What lingers ... is the feeling of hope that the movie brings, that it someday might be possible for female rationality to defeat male brutality.|Fresh
Any hopes that Wonder Woman will sustain its appealing misandry are soon dashed.|Rotten

The film effortlessly streamlines decades of comic book history that blends the DC Universe and Greek mythology, telling the origin of the mysterious, ageless Wonder Woman who stole the show in Batman v Superman.|Fresh
Jenkins has succeeded where DC had thus far failed, and in that sense, Wonder Woman should be (and is being) hailed as a triumph.|Fresh

The best thing about Wonder Woman, the overlong and intermittently enjoyable new DC superhero spectacular, is Wonder Woman herself.|Fresh

Gal Gadot's performance has the poise and humor that conjures up memories of Christopher Reeve.|Fresh
'Wonder Woman' falls victim to over reliance on computer graphics and it's too long. But that's counterbalanced by a story grounded in real emotions and characters who inhabit a three-dimensional world, albeit a comic-book-inspired, fantastical one.|Fresh
... the lone DC Comics project this century not directed by Christopher Nolan that delivers on its advance expectations.|Fresh
Not just one of the better origin stories but one of the most hopeful, positive superhero movies we've seen in a while.|Fresh
Throughout Wonder Woman there is an earnestness in tone that plays well, and rarely as saccharine.|Fresh
This picture tries so hard to avoid making a statement that it becomes the elephant in the room.|Rotten
Director Patty Jenkins displays a deft hand contrasting the gentle beauty of Wonder Woman's paradise island with the horror of the First World War. Her movie is mesmerizing, as she allows the audience to see the world through alien eyes.|Fresh
Wonder Woman gives rising star Gal Gadot the chance to... demonstrate her impressive skill set that includes a nuanced sense of humor, heightened physicality, dramatic gravitas and charismatic self-confidence.|Fresh
To say Wonder Woman is a breath of fresh air would be an understatement to this purely joyful and vibrant ride of a story.|Fresh
Get ready for Gal Gadot to become etched in the pop culture pantheon of strong women who can kick some butt, slay a few stereotypes and own a movie.|Fresh
[Gadot] seems born to play the part. Her ragtag band of sidekicks are a huge breath of fresh air next to the usual super-hero super-groups we're accustomed to.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a fun superhero movie that's well worth checking out on the big screen.|Fresh
The moral of the story, children, is that the world, of superheroes and mere mortals alike, is all the more better when there are more women around.|Fresh
The major problem is its marathon duration of 140 minutes, way too long for a blockbuster noticeably bereft of sustained wow-factor spectacle.|Rotten
Jenkins and Gadot did their level best to give us, within the confines of an unforgiving superhero universe, the Amazing Amazon that fans deserve.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a strong, at times even rousing, application of the superhero film formula, but it ultimately can't transcend the constraints of the genre.|Rotten
Commanding and clear of vision, all the more electrifying because the time is taken to get to know, to understand, and to care about the people onscreen. Imagine that.|Fresh
"Jenkins doesn't need to bludgeon us with pyrotechnics. The real fireworks of the ""Wonder Woman"" narrative are its powerful emotions."|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a top-notch blockbuster, fun and fast and carrying quite a lot of the thematic heft that characterizes the dramatic ambition of the better DC Comics movies as against the more light-hearted Marvel efforts.|Fresh
I blanched slightly at Wonder Woman's almost two-and-a-half-hour running time, but the film raced by -- perhaps because every cliché was subverted by the freshness of a female lead.|Fresh
Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot deliver in Wonder Woman the necessary superhero movie these days. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Wonder Woman is spectacular.|Fresh
A smart, exciting, politically aware origin story.|Fresh
...an old fashioned super hero movie. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but I don't think my strongest impression was supposed to be 'Robin Wright really kicks ass.'|Fresh
I have to admit, my heart soared. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.|Fresh
What's best about the film can be summed up in two words: Gal Gadot.|Fresh
It feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like ... what's the word I'm looking for? A movie. A pretty good one, too.|Fresh
Wonder Woman walks a different path. Her arc in the movie isn't discovering she has powers or that those powers demand responsibility. Her arc is showing that humanity, as deeply flawed as it is, is worth saving.|Fresh
A sturdy origin story, this education of Miss Diana Prince, establishing her as a compassionate badass who consistently proves her bravery, strength, and commitment to justice.|Fresh
Wonder Woman may be a step in the right direction when it comes to getting the DCEU on track, but it still falters in too many places to get itself up to an acceptable level.|Rotten
The first film of the DC Extended Universe that doesn't seem embarrassed by its premise.|Fresh
Far from flawless, but 'Wonder Woman' is arguably the best DC comic book film since 'The Dark Knight.' So, bow down to the Princess.|Fresh
A rousing adventure yarn, shorn of the usual fanboy mythos.|Fresh
Wonder Woman more than shoulders the weight of our expectations, and dazzles us with brilliant kick-ass action and *shocker* heart that her male counterparts couldn't hope to match.|Fresh
Jenkins (and Gadot) particularly excel in the action scenes, because when Wonder Woman first runs across the battlefields in her costume, you are immediately won over.|Fresh
A silly and derivative genre picture that lightly carries an empowering feminist topicality|Fresh
The film's two major strengths come down to the two most important ingredients - cast and story.|Fresh
It's much, much better and more thoughtful than [other superhero films]; its depiction of heroism and humanity, more complex. Most importantly, it's a great time at the movies. More like this, please.|Fresh
There are some moments of bold storytelling, and the focus on humanity, morality and love is an unusual and welcome theme in a superhero movie. (But don't worry, it's not all moralising - Diana still punches a lot of people.)|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a game changer because it is not only the best film of the DCEU but one of the best superhero films ever made.|Fresh
Witnessing such feminine power is mind-boggling and awe-inspiring, but wistful, too. It's a shame that such instances are so rare to be exceptional.|Fresh
With its nods to Richard Donner's Superman and Chris Evans' first outing as Captain America, Wonder Woman also exceeds expectations as an origin story with its First World War setting.|Fresh
For all of Wonder Woman's nifty weapons, the one that proves most indispensable is her chemistry with Chris Pine's ultra-charismatic American spy Steve Trevor.|Fresh
Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman is so super, you could almost forget how important it is. But I hope you don't.|Fresh
Wonder Woman has turned out better than the cynics expected, and has plenty of what fans were hoping for.|Fresh
Her sincerity and compassion are her greatest super powers of all.|Fresh
It's an interesting take both on Wonder Woman and the genre in general, but as so many films like this do, it can't escape the siren pull of Big Dumb Action, with a CGI-laden climax that could be from any movie, so generic is the battle.|Fresh
When Diana DOES spring into action, Wonder Woman rocks. It's as if we're learning exactly what she's capable of at the same time Diana is discovering the depths of her powers.|Fresh
Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was the best thing about the swampy Batman v Superman, and now her solo outing is the far superior film: Wonder Woman, directed by Patty Jenkins, elevates her from third wheel to real deal.|Fresh
Gal Gadot is unstoppable and spectacular to see in motion. Watch her fly.|Fresh
Gadot plays Diana in appealing fashion. For all her strength and prowess, she is an innocent, even comic figure, who simply can't understand the cynicism, politicking, and violence of the humans she encounters.|Fresh
Director Patty Jenkins's fight scenes are masterpieces of motion. Gal Gadot is majestic. Chris Pine is impossibly charming. And Jenkins has created a film that rightfully does justice to its legendary title character.|Fresh
This is a moment 75 years in the making where the hopes and dreams of millions of little girls and adult women finally crystallize into one transcendent image that is proud, defiant, and a long time coming.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a decent but bland addition to the genre that truly shines only in comparison to the rotten DCEU movies so far.|Fresh

Welcome relief from the predictable skyscraper-levelling of the contemporary superhero adventure.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a winner, an immersive origin story with unexpected humor and epic action scenes. Gal Gadot proves she has the right stuff, every bit the feminist icon and hero fans deserve.|Fresh

[A]n electrifying, breathtaking cinematic achievement... Amazing performances, pulse-pounding action, and outstanding visuals make it one of the best superhero movies of all time.|Fresh
The DCEU's game gets raised. Gadot is a godsend, Pine charms, and Jenkins delivers old-school thrills with heart and conviction.|Fresh
You won't be disappointed in the slightest.|Fresh
When it does get down to superheroine business, this latest DC Comics 'extended universe' outing packs a decent punch and, in Israeli model Gal Gadot, introduces a star with real franchise potential.|Fresh
Despite lulls in the overall narrative energy, there are real stakes and sacrifice, along with genuine heart and humor in this welcomely uncluttered tale.|Fresh
Gadot turns out to be as perfect a fit for the iconic character as Christopher Reeve was for the Man of Steel.|Fresh
It has a considerable amount of humor, which may not cause you to laugh out loud but sometimes triggers a smile. If it's possible to describe a superhero film as likeable, this is that film.|Fresh
Wonder Woman ends with a sequel on the horizon, that will certainly get made if the movie inspires little girls to ditch their Disney Princess regalia and learn to scare off creeps with the raise of an eyebrow, the Gal Gadot way.|Fresh
Gadot turns in a terrific display as the titular protagonist, carrying an infectious sense of optimism and wide-eyed wonderment, while ensuring it never once cheapens her sheer power and ability to fight.|Fresh
Gal Gadot has an adventure all her own - and all kinds of awesome - in Wonder Woman, a superheroine film brimming with majesty, action and heart.|Fresh
Gadot was mostly one-dimensional and stoic in her 20 minutes of screen time in Batman v Superman, but here she is lively and exudes a sense of wonder.|Fresh
The hero faces off against a seemingly insurmountable bad-guy-from-Central-Casting, throwing around what appears to be a range of fluorescent Photoshop-generated squiggly lines.|Rotten
What's striking about [Wonder Woman] is the movie's sense of elated lightness.|Fresh
A dynamic and original film we're so thrilled for you girls and boys to see.|Fresh
If Gal Gadot's all-too-brief appearance in Batman v Superman was promising, she fulfills that potential and then some in Wonder Woman.|Fresh
Gal Gadot's Diana is her best performance to date, blending the kindness, power, and innocence needed for the iconic character.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is a beautifully directed superhero movie origin that digs into Diana's transformation from naive warrior to inspiring hero.|Fresh
Praise be, does Wonder Woman ever kick ass.|Fresh
Dawn Of Justice proved [Gadot] could handle the kicking and the punching. Here, she gets actual honest-to-goodness dialogue, and invests Diana with excitable exuberance , bristling defiance and a disarming belief in doing the right thing.|Fresh
Strong, smart, sexy and downright super, this is the superhero blockbuster of the summer you need to see.|Fresh
As witty and heartfelt as it is thrilling - a film that fangirls, fanboys and even those suffering from superhero fatigue can enjoy.|Fresh
Where Wonder Woman excels is in the pure joy and spectacle of its roaring action sequences, which are conservatively deployed to maintain their power.|Fresh
It is the sincerity and strength that radiate from Gadot that completely win you over in a solid, however implausible, script. Justice League? Bring it on.|Fresh
What Patty Jenkins is able to do with all of that is ground it in emotion and character, to make audiences smile and walk out of the theater feeling uplifted rather than exhausted. It's the movie we've been waiting for. Trust me.|Fresh
It's a film that not only improves upon many of the seemingly built-in shortcomings of superhero movies, but also mixes smarts, sentiment and adrenaline in the best Hollywood style.|Fresh
In a genre where fanboy entitlement regularly calls the tune, Wonder Woman's feminism feels like a rarity. Time will tell whether Hollywood [will be] in the thrall of a heroine addiction. But as the credits rolled, I was already craving another hit.|Fresh
It gives us the kind of hero a lot of us fell in love with back in those 12-cent days of truth, justice and the American way - and the kind of movie we haven't seen since Christopher Reeve first flew into our lives.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is leaps and bounds above the other three entries in the DCEU.|Fresh
Like the heroine at its center, Wonder Woman the movie rises with powerful grace above the noise. It's not perfect, but it's often good, sometimes great and exceptionally re-watchable.|Fresh
The film's action is explosive and engaging, and a sequence where Diana ventures into no man's land in the middle of a trench battle is stunning to behold.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is smart, slick, and satisfying in all of the ways superhero films ought to be.|Fresh
Gadot is entirely credible as the embodiment of Amazonian perfection, but there's only so much emotion her concerted brow-furrowing can convey.|Rotten
[Wonder Woman] isn't just a triumph for women, it's a triumph, period. This is grand entertainment with rousing action, sparkling humor, a romantic streak and a titanium-strength debut from Gal Gadot in the title role.|Fresh
Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman provides a welcome respite from DC's house style of grim darkness with star Gal Gadot proving an inspired choice for this avatar of truth, justice and the Amazonian way.|Fresh
Jenkins' feature flips back through time to deliver an origin story that functions beautifully on its own while also bolstering excitement for the franchise's future.|Fresh
It's a lot closer to 'Batman Begins' than 'Green Lantern'.|Fresh
WONDER WOMAN brings a powerful voice to the summer blockbuster; one filled with hope, inspiration and more than enough thrills to satisfy everyone.|Fresh
This origin story, with its direct and relatively uncluttered trajectory, offers a welcome change of pace from a superhero realm that's often overloaded with interconnections and cross-references.|Fresh
"Along with the first ""Iron Man,"" it's the film you point to when you want to prove that this overly prolific genre is worth keeping around."|Fresh

One of the best superhero movies. Ever.|Fresh
Wonder Woman offers a full cinematic experience from beginning-to-end, which helps it stand out from other films of its kind that worry more about what's to come than the story at hand.|Fresh
Exciting, romantic, and funny.|Fresh
Wonder Woman is not only the best film in the re-birthed DC Film slate, but also a ground-breaking entry into the superhero movie cannon.|Fresh
Molded by the mighty Gods, but as shaped by mere mortals Wonder Woman's mettle and beliefs can only be so wonderfully divine.|Fresh
Diana Prince's solo film easily stands out as the best DC film since 'The Dark Knight', and 'Wonder Woman' is a sign of great things to come in the DC Extended Universe.|Fresh
Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman is full of joy and completely without angst or cynicism. It's a breath of fresh air and a total blast from start to finish.|Fresh
