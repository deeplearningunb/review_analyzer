The real genius of Eighth Grade is its universality - an honesty and compassion that cut across generational boundaries.|Fresh

A character study of singular sensitivity. Burnham and Fisher hit upon too many defining aspects of the young-teen experience to list|Fresh
[Director Bo] Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.|Fresh
Unmissable piece of art.|Fresh
Burnham has made a minor classic.|Fresh
A sweet, funny, wonderfully nuanced coming-of-age film that modifies the daily trauma of being 13 for a digital age that demands at least the pretence of a perfectly realised life.|Fresh
While Kayla Day is very much a teenager of her precise time and place, her gruelling anxiety - and Fisher's wonderful yearning in the role - make her universally relatable anyway.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is also deeply sweet in unexpected places and howlingly funny, attuned to the timeless indignities of any adolescence.|Fresh

All in all, Eighth Grade is just an excellent film, well-acted, well-shot, well-written and perfectly paced.|Fresh
Eighth Grade doesn't capture the world ending, but never discredits the moments when Kayla feels like it could.|Fresh
The movie catches every marginal cringing embarrassment and each infinitesimal joy. Very little happens in it, and yet everything does.|Fresh
Gloriously, cringe-inducingly authentic, watch to understand the teenagers in your life - or just to forgive the teen you once were.|Fresh
Bo Burnham's Eighth Grade is an honest and authentic portrayal of the teen experience.|Fresh

Without moralizing intentions, director Bo Burnham explores the adolescent anguish in the era of the social networks, showing it, without dramatic bursts, like a state maintained without resolution. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

It definitely rang true to me.|Fresh
"We're all still growing up, and ""Eighth Grade"" resonates powerfully with memories and experiences deeply buried, recent and raw, or witnessed in our own adolescent offspring. It is a painful but worthwhile experience."|Fresh
A film that stands out for the freshness of its script, although in the end it struggles to be profound. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

Her journey [is] handled with an honesty and unforced delicacy that imbues the film with pungent authenticity, right down to Kayla's facial blotches, imperfect teeth and her secret joy over a blossoming friendship.|Fresh
A fantastic and honest 'coming of age' film that does everything but simplify the stage we like to remember, but keep getting embarrassed about. [Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Writer / Director Bo Burnham's intimate ode to early teenage angst feels like a documentary rather than a fictional narrative, making it just as awkward and relatable as its lead character.|Fresh
There's no schmaltz, no faux tragedy, no bullshit in Burnham's movie. It's got integrity, compassion and respect for its subjects and audience.|Fresh
Because he originally hails from the world of comedy, Burnham is perfectly in tune with the painful absurdities of adolescence, when simply walking out into a pool can feel like a walk of shame.|Fresh

"""Eighth Grade"" is not only a showcase for Burnham, it's also a breakthrough for lead actress Elsie Fisher. Together, they've crafted something that will stand the test of time."|Fresh

Eighth Grade is one of the most sincere and authentic films of the year. You will laugh, and likely cry depending on the moment in the film.|Fresh
Hamilton's performance as the single dad, who is as awkward as his daughter, is warm and positive. Fisher is a revelation and plays her role painfully well.|Fresh
Should be standard viewing for younger audiences and anyone that appreciates genuine, heartfelt teen cinema.|Fresh
Perhaps our premium on awkward indie realism is just a tad high?|Rotten
Funny and heartbreaking, and anchored by Fisher, whose performance ranks among the best by a teenager ever, the film makes surviving early adolescence seem heroic, both for the children and for those who love them.|Fresh
Lives spent looking at devices and screens is a reality for most of us, for better or worse; Eighth Grade is notable because it consciously avoids serving up a familiar media brew of technophobia and misogyny.|Fresh

It's equal parts heartbreaking and sweet, and it miraculously never hits a false note.|Fresh
Beneath the veneer of a quippy teenage dramedy, Eighth Grade is a devastating study of anxiety, depicting with keen insight the crushing weight of the disease.|Fresh

Eighth Grade beats back toxic masculinity with kindness.|Fresh
A hilarious and often horrifying exploration of the trials of growing up.|Fresh

A sweet, compassionate, and clear-eyed depiction of adolescence.|Fresh

A very impressive directorial debut.|Fresh

Penetrating, poignant, and often painful to watch, Eighth Grade is one of the smarter American coming-of-age films of late.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is personal, uncomfortable, and lovely, a slice-of-life look into current adolescence, our reliance on social media, and growing into oneself.|Fresh
The best film of 2018 to date.|Fresh
Brings back for me in a good way the unwanted memories I have of the eight grade, something I'm still trying to forget without resorting to therapy.|Fresh
Such is the miracle of this movie that I felt pangs of recognition all throughout it even though I am basically the dad's age and not the daughter's, and also not a parent.|Fresh

A lovely but cringe-inducing film about one of the most precarious times in a person's life.|Fresh
Eighth Grade Directed by Bo Burnham, is a frankly ingenious and honest film about the life of any teenager in these times. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

"It isn't a question as to whether or not ""Eighth Grade"" will appear on year-end ""Best of"" lists, it's just a question of where on that list will it fall."|Fresh
Will catapult you backwards in time to the worst moments of your life. I had to put my hands over my eyes a couple of times to block out the agony. It is infinitely more harrowing than Tom Cruise dangling from a helicopter.|Fresh
Extremely well done.|Fresh
A fascinating and nuanced portrait of a 13-year-old compulsive cell phone user yearning for connections.|Fresh
A hit at January's Sundance Film Festival, this portrait of one shy girl weathering middle school is one of the funniest, most cringe-inducing and most poignant films of the year.|Fresh
A marvelously, horrifically authentic dramedy. Burnham uses music and other cinematic effects to heighten the comedy, but the characters remain down to earth.|Fresh
There's no doubt that watching Eighth Grade will remind you deeply of all the pains of adolescence, but the movie's relatability isn't just limited to that age, which might be what makes it such a transcendently heartbreaking experience.|Fresh
This is not a coming-of-age film about a girl finding her voice, but rather realizing its worth, regardless of the approval of others.|Fresh
The movie feels like a documentary to so many of our young lives.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is uncomfortable to watch, but that's a sign it's getting things right (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
Insightful and excruciating, proving that Junior High is horrific, even more brutal than you remember...|Fresh

The terrors of Eighth Grade are completely relatable.|Fresh

Eighth Grade is an awkward coming-of-age comedy done well.|Fresh
Despite her awkward delivery, Kayla's actual philosophy is pretty spot on, and, more amazingly, in the course of the film, she actually follows her own edicts, generally to positive effect.|Fresh
"This is part of the sweet charm of ""Eighth Grade,"" even if it means it doesn't have as much narrative arc as it could. It lives in those small moments that feel big."|Fresh
Burnham captures that teenage feeling you get that the world is a hopeless pit of despair, and at the same time he shows that it doesn't have to be. Summer is always just around the corner.|Fresh
Transports you to a very specific and tumultuous time - moving from middle to high school. Burnham makes you engage specifically with Kayla, but also hits all the right notes when sparking nostalgia and challenging the viewer to do some self-reflection.|Fresh
An extremely intimate look into the mind of an average girl in an era when social media and cellphones have destroyed much of human interaction.|Fresh
It's a lovably shaggy ode to anyone who's ever tried to fit in, failed miserably, and then brushed herself off and slouched back out there again.|Fresh
It's a return trip most of us would not care to make in real life, but we can view Burnham's intense replication from a safe distance, with a spectator's eye - and escape, intact, after only 93 minutes.|Fresh
Eighth Grade captures the palpable fears of kids like Kayla in the face of the oppressive indifference from her peers and her failing attempts to achieve the recognition she earnestly strives for.|Fresh

An astutely observed film built around honesty and genuine emotion, it's smart, funny and heartbreaking -- and it shouldn't be missed.|Fresh

A couple of scenes in this movie absolutely will make you squirm until your seat breaks.|Fresh
Totally harrowing.|Fresh
"""Eighth Grade"" has style and confidence, but Burnham's attention to the nuances of adolescence and his respect for his lead character is downright thrilling, making a teen movie that's perfectly in step with the real thing."|Fresh
With Fisher's endearingly open face projecting every insecurity along the way, Kayla's journey of baby-steps self-empowerment resonates.|Fresh
OMG, Eighth Grade is, like, going to give you all the feels.|Fresh
It's a fairly compelling slice of life examination. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
"Watching Eighth Grade, you want to gently shake Kayla-and your eighth-grade self-and assure her, ""It gets better."""|Fresh
You feel every lunchroom snub, every birthday-party fumble that 13-year-old Kayla (Ellie Fisher) experiences deep in your bones. And yet as uncomfortable as watching can be, I would pay money in a heartbeat to see this movie again.|Fresh
Eighth Grade gets as far inside the miserable aspects of eighth grade as I think it's possible to go.|Fresh
A low-key slice-of-girlhood for viewers who found Lady Bird too commercial.|Fresh
Burnham nicely captures the quirks and cadences of teen-speak. In that sense, Eighth Grade also serves as a nifty time capsule of 2018.|Fresh
An achingly honest film about some of the ghastliest years of adolescence. Funny, tender and endearing.|Fresh
Adorably cringe-worthy|Fresh
Burnham... ends up making a movie about internet immersion that ratifies the importance of human contact.|Fresh

This is a movie that refuses to shy away from some fairly dark realities yet at the same time doesn't dwell on them in ways that feel exploitive or supercilious.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is a harrowing portrait of anxiety and acceptance in a post-social-media landscape, showing how all of us cope with an ever-changing, constantly refreshing world.|Fresh
There's plenty of discourse on how The Youth spend too much time with screens, but Eighth Grade is more interested in understanding Kayla's story on her terms than judging it on someone else's.|Fresh
...an exhausting, if ultimately uplifting, experience.|Fresh
Its strength is reminding of an experience that we forgot, but one to which we can all relate, even if you weren't a kid like Kayla.|Fresh
Elsie Fisher is a bright new discovery cementing herself as the Molly Ringwald for the Snapchat generation.|Fresh
You quiver, you cringe and you want to break down and cry. That's how powerful Elsie Fisher's turn as Kayla is in its ability to summon the worst memories of your early teens.|Fresh
"Surely one of the year's most notable writing and directing debuts, Bo Burnham's ""Eighth Grade"" gets as close to the heart, mind and soul of a young person as a movie can."|Fresh
Where Burnham surprises is in his directing. He possesses a keen eye for how young teens see the world, everything bigger and broader or smaller and suffocating, and nothing in between.|Fresh
As much as Burnham can be applauded, it's impossible not to clap even harder for the pitch-perfect acting of newcomer Elsie Fisher, a marvel in the lead role of an apparently unremarkable 13-year-old.|Fresh
The real treasure of Eight Grade, the one that transforms it from a very good film into one of the year's best, is the knockout performance by Elsie Fisher.|Fresh
Writer-director Bo Burnham and lead Elsie Fisher give coming of age film fresh twist.|Fresh
Bo Burnham's big-hearted, emotional tidal wave of a movie shows how the look-at-me / leave-me-alone contradictions of adolescence, powered by social media, are cranked up to 11...|Fresh

Eighth Grade is a work of supreme empathy ... it's a film that feels resolutely both of its time and timeless.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is a revelation of both a remarkably natural young performer and a clever, sensitive young filmmaker.|Fresh
"An extraordinary movie about an ordinary girl named Kayla, ""Eighth Grade"" follows her through a final week of middle school."|Fresh
This is what adolescence feels like, and this is what we worked hard to forget. If Eighth Grade is sometimes too painful to be enjoyable, well, we can't blame it for telling the truth.|Fresh
Burnham is clearly conflicted about the emotional effects of the constant comparisons, competitions and invidious voyeurism young people are subjecting themselves to nearly all day long. And he gets the subjective experience right.|Fresh
Burnham has constructed a remarkably thoughtful first feature film.|Fresh
I loved the look and simple but effective style of this film.|Fresh
What most stunned me about 'Eighth Grade' was how well directed it is. It's rare that teen movies have the kind of visual acuity and verve that Burnham achieves here.|Fresh
"""Eighth Grade"" turns out to be an appealingly generous portrait of adolescent awkwardness, also of parental awkwardness, though Josh Hamilton's fumbling dad is a keeper."|Fresh
Burnham's sociological precision as a screenwriter and director, however, would likely not feel as genuine if not for Fisher in the pivotal role of Kayla. She doesn't act the part as much as she breathes it.|Fresh
Everybody who has been through eighth grade needs to see Eighth Grade.|Fresh
Burnham's filmmaking is unfussy yet thought through, so Fisher's seemingly artless performance is actually a pretty brilliant piece of acting.|Fresh
"""Eighth Grade"" is a beautiful and uncompromising piece of art, from a distinctive new talent."|Fresh
It's indie-movie self-pity, served-up with obvious, preening social criticism.|Rotten
"The transition between junior high and high school is exhilarating, traumatic, funny and horrifying, and Bo Burnham's ""Eighth Grade"" captures the whole experience perfectly."|Fresh
Burnham'sEighth Gradeis the most realistic depiction of those awkward middle school years ever on the big screen.|Fresh
Eighth Grade masterfully captures the emotional horror of being a Generation Z middle-schooler, yet tells a universally relatable coming of age story.|Fresh
It's a modest, intimate movie that contains a whole world - and one I could recognize and understand even though I grew up in an entirely different era from Burnham or Kayla.|Fresh
Burnham doesn't revel in Kayla's misery or exploit her for shock value. She does have her own share of heartache, but plenty of moments of happiness too.|Fresh
A refreshingly thoughtful exploration of adolescent online and offline identity, and how the two intersect, or don't.|Fresh
It's special, and rare, to see such a complex yet understanding and respectful look at a young woman's life.|Fresh
In the film, you're so immersed in the awkwardness of Kayla's life, that her long, timid walk from the guest bathroom in her lime green one-piece to the pool almost makes you sweat with anxiety.|Fresh
Whether through natural acting prowess or natural being-13-ness, [Elsie Fisher] nails the part.|Fresh
A small, lovely, touching movie that sums up all that's wrong and all that's right with being a teen and feeling unmoored.|Fresh
"""Eighth Grade"" is both revelatory and all-embracing."|Fresh
The culmination of [the stars'] onscreen relationship is profoundly moving... just as Eighth Grade points toward enduring careers for its writer/director and star.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is absolute vital viewing for anyone in the age range and parents; the best movie of 2018 so far, no question about it. Elsie Fisher better receive an Oscar nomination|Fresh
"I may be on the wrong end of the age spectrum to really know how ""Eighth Grade"" will strike the target audience - teens, not just teen girls. But, I think they will like it."|Fresh
Eighth Grade is a film that perfectly captures the spirit and awkwardness of being a student in the final year of middle school.|Fresh
A genuinely warm, tender and wise coming-of-age film that ranks among the great coming-of-age films like Boyhood, Ghost World and The 400 Blows. Elsie Fisher is a revelation.|Fresh
For a gloriously funny and heartbreaking 94 minutes, you will feel like you're 13 again.|Fresh
The film reflects arguably the worst stretch of growing up in America's education system, but it's rarely if ever ugly. Instead, it's compassionate, radiating retroactive kindness for the children we all were to soothe the adults we are now.|Fresh
... loaded with sharp dialogue and insightful subtext that captures the awkwardness of contemporary childhood without feeling watered down.|Fresh
It's less a movie, and more a cringe-inducing, full-body flashback to the exquisite excruciation of being an adolescent.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is low-key but a comparable landmark in the history of realistic teens on-screen.|Fresh
Elsie Fisher carries the movie in a performance that's nuanced and thoughtful.|Fresh
Painfully realistic, tenderly acted coming-of-age dramedy.|Fresh
EIGHTH GRADE is a sublime debut for Burnham.|Fresh
This movie feels genuine. It loves the characters, but it doesn't let them off the hook necessarily.|Fresh
This is a damn near perfect movie.|Fresh
I was just surprised over and over again at how deeply touching it is while seeming effortlessly so.|Fresh
Eighth Grade expertly captures those middle school growing pains every American kid for generations has endured.|Fresh
Startlingly empathetic, wincingly honest, and always completely charming.|Fresh
Writer-director Bo Burnham, in his feature debut, skillfully intertwines the timeless aspects of adolescent humiliation and the very particular ways in which today's tech has changed them.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is so grounded in the reality of middle school it almost operates like a horrible collective flashback.|Fresh
Writer/director Bo Burnham is a comedian, singer/songwriter/musician, actor and poet, but to the best of my knowledge, he's never been a thirteen year-old girl, which makes his feature film debut all the more impressive.|Fresh
Many filmmakers have tried and failed to do what Burnham's achieved in this remarkable debut.|Fresh
It is so viscerally authentic to the experience of being in middle school that for a moment I felt like I was standing in the lunchroom clutching my tray.|Fresh
Eighth Grade's only real drawback is how accurately it depicts being an awkward tween.|Fresh
Throughout, we're invited to chuckle at the ironies of Kayla's hobbies and activities, but underlying such scenes is a strain of eeriness, as if the film were offering up a post-human spin on Pretty in Pink.|Fresh
"Poignantly funny, wrenchingly wise and meltingly beautiful, ""Eighth Grade"" is a not-so-small miracle of independent filmmaking."|Fresh
The most authentic portrait of budding teenagerdom you're likely to see in theaters anytime soon.|Fresh
"In a landscape dominated by teen movies that bank so heavily on well-worn archetypes and weepy melodramatic situations, experiencing a film like ""Eighth Grade"" can feel almost miraculous in how natural it is."|Fresh
Every moment drips with aching - and, at times, heart-swelling - authenticity. The heart swelling is where the ugly cry kicks in.|Fresh
First-time director Bo Burnham's tender take on teen angst, starring an incandescent Elsie Fisher, is a flat-out triumph-a film that is both indelibly of the moment and achingly timeless.|Fresh
More than anything, this emotionally unsparing but never-punishing movie feels like the work of someone who kept his eyes and ears wide open.|Fresh
"""Eighth Grade"" is a simple story of an unremarkable girl, tenderly and movingly told."|Fresh
Eighth Grade isn't easy, both on screen and in life, but it's a film that should be a rite of passage for all, no matter the age.|Fresh
A stirring, painfully accurate slice-of-life, the kind of film so authentically observed it sometimes feels more like a cinéma vérité documentary than a scripted feature film.|Fresh
Bo Burnham's funny and heartwarming 'Eighth Grade' is also a deeply serious film about female adolescence in the age of social media, with plenty of casual wisdom to spare.|Fresh
Burnham's screenplay doesn't just feel attuned to the mindset of 13-year-old girls like Kayla - it feels like a paean to embracing the final moments of childlike innocence, instead of rushing to grow up.|Fresh
It's heartbreaking, heartwarming, and a total charmer.|Fresh
If there's a more haunting portrait of what it's like to grow up now, I'm not sure I could take it.|Fresh
A deeply kind movie, curious and nonjudgmental even about the characters who in most coming-of-age films would be hissable villains.|Fresh
[Burnham] smothers the story in sentiment, stereotypes, and good intentions.|Rotten
Highlights Elsie Fisher's stunning performance as an awkward 13-year-old who tries to overcome her shyness by posting videos of advice to her peers.|Fresh
Fisher delivers a glorious symphony of awkward poignancy, from Kayla's cringe-worthy attempts to chat up a popular girl to her ultimately sweet connection with her kind, befuddled single dad.|Fresh
I usually find coming of age films to be formulaic and unimaginative, but Eighth Grade had me hook, line, and sinker the whole time.|Fresh
Bo Burnham's narrative feature debut finds humor and hope in a painfully realistic middle school story.|Fresh
Elsie Fisher makes Eighth Grade a triumphant manifesto for all who have felt awkward, misunderstood and abused at a time when they just wanted to be cheered.|Fresh
Eighth Grade is a brilliantly raw, honest portrayal about the middle school experience.|Fresh
