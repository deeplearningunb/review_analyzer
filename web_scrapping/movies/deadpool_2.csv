Deadpool 2 should be exactly what fans expect from a sequel, an ambitious upgrade that offers more jokes, more violence, more action and more vulgarity.|Fresh
Humor deteriorates into nauseating jokes about pedophilia, character-vivisection, border-line racism and crudity. Escalating violence also undercuts the story-line which gets lost in the mayhem.|Rotten
This movie is to much... too much metafiction, too much eighties jokes, to much camp fun. And that's a perfect amount of craziness for a character like Deadpool. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool 2 touts a great list of insults for those looking for stingers, and could easily contend for the most quotable movie of the year.|Fresh
Everything that you got in the first film, you get times three.|Fresh
A fine sequel that manages to create an engaging and original story and doesn't depend solely on the main character's dealings with the fourth wall. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
Every bit as outrageous, irreverent and fourth-wall breaking as before.|Fresh
Visually this movie feels like the Deadpool video game came to life, like the comics came to life, and ultimately had more heart than most of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is a more than worthy successor and, in many places, is often considerably better than its predecessor.|Fresh

Deadpool 2 is a more than worthy successor and, in many places, is often considerably better than its predecessor.|Fresh
Ultimately Deadpool 2 is a step in the right direction, even if the series shoots itself in the foot by hinting at what this could be, if it grew up a little bit.|Fresh
[Deadpool 2] is foulmouthed and funny, unafraid to be genuine in its emotional engagement while also doling out the violence and viscera with unabashed joy.|Fresh
It's all wrapped in a deliberate sloppy pose and disarrayed hysteria.|Rotten
It's a perfect mix of, and tribute to, Rob Liefeld, Fabian Nicieza and Joe Kelly.|Fresh
Here's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, aims at entertaining you, and succeeds. The dialogues are witty, the soundtrack is perfect for the narrative, the editing is crisp and the movie doesn't allow you to check your phone.|Fresh
This sequel may have given us more of the same, but when the initial feature is that awesome, it is a great achievement to recapture some of that blood-soaked magic.|Fresh
In this second installment of the Deadpool cinema franchise, I was mightily impressed with the visual and computer effects ...|Rotten
If you liked the kookiness you probably liked the film, but if you found that wanting you probably wondered what was all the commotion.|Rotten
David Leitch and Ryan Reynolds have done something quite incredible with the Merc With A Mouth's second REAL cinematic appearance... They made it better than the first one.|Fresh
The meta comedy of Deadpool 2 manages to outdo its predecessor both in term of scope and deep cuts.|Fresh
It's a movie that's worth your time, especially if you enjoyed the first outing, and you're not easily offended.|Fresh
Quizás, la regla más valiosa que rompe Deadpool 2 es el principio que una secuela no puede ser mejor que la original, porque en ese sentido esta entrega es más grande, irreverente, astuta y significativa que su antecesora.|Fresh
Smarter, funnier, and more violent than its predecessor, this sequel combines all the ingredients in a way that's sure to delight fans.|Fresh
"Deadpool rules! Absolutely riotous in its blood-splattered insanity, ""Deadpool 2"" does its intended job in delivering the overstuffed antics rooted in the free-wheeling nonsense of Reynolds's brand of bouncy badassness."|Fresh
is all the different and all the same that a  sequel needed to be. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool 2 manages to recapture and improve on all the fun, action, and ridiculousness that made the first film so charming.|Fresh
As the body count rises the Fourth Wall is reduced to mere rubble, which means in future all movies will simply be our favourite stars talking directly to us through the screen, or maybe next to us on our sofas. Funny, clever and good-hearted.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is essentially a live action Looney Toons cartoon masquerading as a superhero film. It's not trying to be high art, it's just trying to make you laugh.|Fresh
Everything feels bloated and rehashed; the villains are under-written, poorly acted and inconsequential to the story as a whole. It's the same movie all over again.|Rotten
Deadpool 2 doubles down on the delightful insanity of its predecessor and confirms my long held belief that adding Josh Brolin to anything immediately makes it better.|Fresh
Just like with the first film, Deadpool 2 works in the ways that it needs to work.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is holistically a better movie than the first; it's often funnier, filthier, and is generally more inspired.|Fresh
This is Deadpool at maximum capacity; filthy, hilarious, blood-soaked mayhem with more than a few tricks up its sleeve. Don't miss that mid-credits stinger.|Fresh
It's a movie that delivers everything it promises, but doesn't offer that same sense of surprise that only the first film could ever pull off.|Fresh
"This is at least the kind of thing the ""real"" X-Men movies should probably be doing instead of trying to be The Avengers."|Fresh
"This is one of the clearest examples of ""Give the audience what they want"" sequels I can think of. It has just as much violence, just as much profanity, and just as many whiplash-inducing one-liners."|Fresh
Once the film gets going, it's almost impossible to resist its anarchic energy, which is matched only by its underlying, shockingly sincere emotional core.|Fresh
The highlight of the entire film may be its final end-credits scene that must have been especially satisfying for Reynolds to make.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 isn't going to win over new fans for the Merc with a Mouth.|Fresh
Overall, Deadpool 2 is a decent improvement over the first, a more assured and calculated film that takes what worked about his debut effort and slices off the fat.|Fresh
Sure we've seen most of this before, but for now, it's still fun to see it again.|Fresh
It may not be the godsend the original was, but the sequel holds up -- just well enough to virtually guarantee a third chapter.|Fresh
The world needs to laugh right now, and Reynolds is here with some much-needed and timely levity. Thank god for Deadpool.|Fresh
If you loved the first one, you'll almost undoubtedly fall head over heels for this one as well.|Fresh
Despite still not knowing the family all that well, there's still a desire to see what else Deadpool's House for Dysfunctional Mutants has in its halls.|Fresh
I didn't love Deadpool as most did, I thought it had some pacing issues and while Deadpool 2 may not be as sharp as it wants, at least it corrects some of those mistakes and in return is the better film of the two.|Fresh
"A good sequel answers the question ""What next?"" This bad sequel just says, ""Let's do the same schtick, and literally crank it up to 11 in case anyone misses what we're about."""|Rotten
Josh Brolin brings real gravitas to this free for all. But when it's said and done, way too violent for this delicate flower.|Fresh
The laughs start immediately with the insanely brilliant intro/opening credits sequence and never stop until the equally insane mid-credits stingers.|Fresh
He attempts something that is kryptonite to this kind of character: sincerity...the movie is very good, but not as good as the first one.|Rotten
[Deadpool 2] is just as funny as the first one and I love that this franchise has embraced its role as the smart aleck in the front row.|Fresh
This is a rare comedy sequel that not only is able to meet expectations of the original, but also expand on the world that was created and the characters that were created and give them surprisingly a little more depth.|Fresh
If you like your cinema understated and refined, then this is not for you. But for the rest of us, there's enough to enjoy here.|Fresh
I don't think the second film is terrible, I did find it quite dull.|Rotten
Bursts of laughter pepper the film's landscape like mines. It's fun. Hollow, but fun.|Fresh
If your idea of fun is clever wisecracks and inventive bloodshed, DEADPOOL 2 provides these in abundance.|Fresh
Probably the best end sequence of any comic book movie of all-time...the entertainment value of Deadpool 2 is off the charts.|Fresh
There are a few things all that meta-referencing can't solve - a bland CG fight or narrative shortcut is still that, even if Deadpool points to it - but when it's such fun for the most part (minus a rough second act), it's hard not to be swept away.|Fresh
You know when you first see a meme that's fresh, still funny? Now, think about when you see that same meme after 4 months worth of riffing....that's Deadpool 2.|Rotten
This is a wickedly fun time with some vivacious acting.|Fresh
The writers take no prisoners for they destroy everyone involved in pop culture in the most innovative ways other than just name dropping.|Fresh
...no grand satire here, just self-awareness - and enough surprises, solid jokes and well-crafted action sequences to be entertaining.|Fresh
Atomic Blonde director David Leitch is no stranger to high intensity action, and here he is able to marry his sense of stylish combat with a keen understanding of franchise's wit.|Fresh
[Deadpool 2] is a fairly big-budget, superhero tent-pole with the unforgiving weight of expectations... on its shoulders.|Fresh
'Deadpool 2' is the rare but welcome sequel that not only lives up to expectations, but does so by not completely rehashing the first film.|Fresh
Despite all its hip mayhem, directed both at anonymous thugs and at well-thumbed pulp tropes, Deadpool 2 is also good-hearted. It doesn't strike me as nihilistic or even cynical.|Fresh
Deadpool may not be the hero we want, but he is the hero we need.|Fresh
[Deadpool 2] certainly lived up to the hype of the first movie and is a great addition to the Deadpool/X-Force family.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is terribly constructed. Why things happen doesn't really make much sense. The plot is an illogical mess of action scenes and joke setups.|Rotten
Only able to stand being hectored for so long, I left the theater...|Rotten
You can only be first once and Reynolds' solution is more of everything. Deadpool 2 is everything you'd expect from a sequel. It's longer, has a bigger budget, bigger action scenes, more violence, more rudeness, more cameos - and dare I say - more heart.|Fresh
The film is, without a doubt, is funny, cynical, hysterical and sometimes in bad taste, but the character Deadpool has a picaresque flavor that is unmatched. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It becomes, as promised early on, a (dysfunctional) family movie about pushing yourself and others out of emotional ruts, and not making friendship conditional.|Fresh
pretty much exactly what you are probably expecting it to be, which makes it, in and of itself, a wholly satisfying dive into the amusingly ribald and bloody world of Marvel's most anti-Marvel character|Fresh
Reynolds and Brolin have undeniable chemistry together, with their burgeoning bromance being one of the best parts of the film.|Fresh
Zazie Beetz as Domino is absolutely wonderful.|Fresh
If you're a fan of the snarky, one-liner, potty-mouthed, red latex bodysuit, invincible guy - then you'll likely be entertained - it's outrageous adult raunchy fun.|Fresh
No doubt, Marvel fanboys will continue wondering how snugly Deadpool fits into the whole Marvel Comic Universe. It's an issue that keeps some people up at nights. For everyone else, chalk this up as an OK timer killer|Fresh
Builds on what came before to give us an undoubtedly more unwieldly but also more enjoyably bombastic, bigger scale experience.|Fresh
"The biggest surprise in ""Deadpool 2"" might just be how it enters the ranks of the very same thing it supposedly mocks: Politically correct cinema."|Rotten
When Deadpool 2 is boasting about great it is and claiming it's different, it's a slog.|Rotten
A modest improvement over the original.|Fresh
I very much enjoyed Deadpool 2 when I enjoyed it, but when I didn't, I found it to be tedious. The plot is basic and, for a film that prides itself on innovation, also a little derivative.|Fresh
"The pop culture references are too much at times, but not enough to sully all the effort that plainly went into making a harder, better, faster, stronger ""Deadpool"" movie."|Fresh
"You can't make fun of superhero action films and, at the same time, be a good example of one...[but] the exception in the case of superhero action films is the ""Deadpool"" series."|Fresh
For a brief period, Deadpool seemed like the most subversive player on the cinematic superhero circuit, deflating the genre's pretensions with a barrage of self-referential humor and fourth wall-breaking asides.|Fresh
Fortunately, this new delivery is more of the same, but in a good way... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This Deadpool sequel avoids the worst of the problems seen in many sequels, and manages to recapture the comedy, if not the charm, of the original 2016 surprise hit film.|Fresh
Successfully builds upon the formula of the first movie to make for a highly entertaining slab of bloodletting violence and gut-busting laughs.|Fresh
It's a little too cute for it's own good at times but still a lot of fun.|Fresh
The popular Marvel antihero is back with more action, more laughs, more meta commentary and surprisingly, more progressive ideas than in a any other superhero movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's an enjoyable exercise for those with knowledge of... the last fifteen years of Superman, Batman, Iron Man, Thor and the whole troupe. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Those responsible have preferred to repeat the formula of success rather than continue looking for new horizons that will expand and even improve upon the results. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"It's not a difficult movie to watch, between the pace of the action and the pace of the jokes, but whether or not it's ""fun"" is entirely in the eye of the beholder."|Fresh
The funniest, raunchiest, most entertaining of all comic book heroes returns in a pretty good sequel that delivers all the laughs you could want and a pitch perfect Ryan Reynolds.|Fresh
This film is so much better than Avengers: Infinity War that it's ridiculous.|Fresh
Because the sequel to the Merc with the Mouth is once again a great comedy, and that is the only thing that should matter to us. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I loved this movie, I think it's funnier and more intelligent than its predecessor, but I know it's not for everyone.|Fresh
When a joke is good, I guess it works if it's told several times. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Represents a significant improvement over the original while still not being particularly good.|Rotten
a lot like 2016's Deadpool, actually, only with more outlandishness and a larger supporting entourage|Fresh
The filmmakers couldn't care less what offends people and assume that no one is too delicate to appreciate the trademarked Deadpool balance of hyper-violence and the gleefully profane.|Fresh
Most of the jokes in Deadpool 2 fly at you like a gatling gun, firing off random references that you've probably never heard of.|Rotten
Reynolds's underlying sweetness takes the edge off the comic's homicidal self-pity, though the endless shtick has a miss-to-hit ratio of about three to one.|Rotten
Deadpool is more than happy with being the class clown of the superhero movie landscape, and Reynolds is here to please.|Fresh
The reality, though, is that nothing the least bit subversive is happening here.|Rotten
Ryan Reynolds has notably gotten more comfortable in the role, giving layers to the comedic character.|Fresh
Although, there is some funny stuff here, after a while the constant patter, quips, and heaving sludge of profanity become exhausting.|Rotten
[Deadpool 2] seems more relaxed and comfortable in the way it both skewers the superhero formula and then completely succumbs to it. Then has no trouble pointing out what a sellout it is.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is just like Deadpool 1; it's Ryan Reynolds being sassy in red spandex, f***ing s*** up for two hours. It's entertaining and funny as hell, but ultimately unsurprising.|Fresh
Hilarious movie however the jokes overpower every other aspect of the movie so much so that you wonder if Deadpool is getting his own Netflix comedy special.|Fresh
Everything new and fresh in the first is old and trite in the sequel.|Rotten
[Deadpool 2] has just the right balance of coarseness and political incorrectness.|Fresh
'Deadpool 2' might not feel as fresh or as new as its predecessor, but it manages to avoid the majority of mistakes sequels tend to make. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Deadpool 2] picked the wrong path and needed more work. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
The cranked-up continuation of its 2016 original, the second coming of Deadpool is every bit as over-the-top and overblown as one would expect - and then some.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is a wildly entertaining film that without a doubt audiences should not miss even if they aren't fans of the superhero genre. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
11 minutes longer than Deadpool, and much less focused in its narrative momentum, but it somehow feels breezier and bouncier.|Fresh
The writing's funnier this time and Reynold's exhaustingly energetic performance holds the show together, while leaving little room for anyone else to shine.|Fresh
Don't be fooled by this civilised plot outline. Deadpool 2 is mostly a litany of violence, off-colour gags and enough fourth-wall breaks to make you wonder if it's possible for a comedy film to be too self-aware.|Fresh
I got confused and then bored by a story that ties this franchise ever closer to the X-Men.|Rotten
The movie is most enjoyable when it's just being goofy, but Part 3 will need to up the ante.|Fresh
Here, quoting George Michael and copping a feel of other superheroes' buttocks, Reynolds seems freer in a red leather unitard than he ever did batting his eyelashes at Sandra Bullock in The Proposal. He's found himself behind a mask.|Fresh
Much as the film pokes fun at Reynolds' failed attempts at bringing a comic book character to life in the past, the sense is provided here that the Deadpool franchise has really become his major career achievement.|Fresh
The overall tone of sad mopey Deadpool makes the movie a bummer. Of all the Marvel characters, Deadpool is not the guy who can pull off gravitas. He should be the guy making fun of Peter Parker and Tony Stark for being so emo.|Rotten
In any case, the characters are better designed and better developed in this second adventure... So it also improves the meta-humor of Deadpool 2. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool 2 finds new ways to tell old jokes, and for that, it's (mostly) a success.|Fresh
[Director] David Leitch's action lifts Deadpool to the top. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This satire mocks the superhero genre I loathe, but it is just a video game gone wild, full of irresponsible violence without consequence. Just because it mocks codswallop does not mean that it is not codswallop itself.|Rotten
It's [Ryan Reynold's] enthusiasm and willingness to send up his own previous rom-com friendly image that really sells the anarchic comedy.|Fresh
... the sequel is fun, wrong in the right ways, and completely over-the-top... accomplishes everything it sets out to do while inexplicably being less the sum of its parts.|Fresh
Two years after Ryan Reynolds revived the idea that a mainstream genre film could be violent and mirthful...here's an old fashioned sequel that piles on more and delivers less.|Fresh
Full of mayhem, vulgarity and hilarity ... like the first one.|Fresh
"If I'm sounding a little evasive here, it's because the film company has asked reviewers not to give away too much of the film. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Like its predecessor, ""Deadpool 2"" is one of the best comic book films ever."|Fresh
While Deadpool generated interest as a worthy origin tale, Deadpool 2 struggles when it comes to an engaging story.|Rotten
Deadpool 2 doesn't reward a deep analysis because it's not a complicated film. It's just wilfully stupid, but it is some finely crafted stupidity.|Fresh
More disciplined than its sire, DEADPOOL 2 doesn't let up on its outrageous laughs, including clever in-jokes, meta references and over-the top action excitement; while introducing new heroes and giving the returning guard a bit more depth.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 goes bigger than the first, but the shockingly touching family theme pulls all of the new characters and big set pieces together well. Another wild, hilarious ride for the character with just enough honesty and heart.|Fresh
"Deadpool - in all his jabbering glory - is the salve we need to heal the emotional damage caused by ""Avengers: Infinity Wars."""|Fresh
There's very little to enjoy here.|Rotten
Fast lines, shameless asides, no holds barred. Best outtakes in movie history & the last is the funniest of all. Lots of other actors but it is Reynolds who owns the movie.|Fresh
Another carefree, gleefully ridiculous, and comically violent romp through superhero comics and pop culture.|Fresh
The best part of Deadpool 2 is what occurs during the closing credits. The worst part of Deadpool 2 is what occurs before the opening credits. As for that vast middle ground between the opening and closing credits? It's mostly a kick.|Fresh
Nearly everything about the original Deadpool was fresh and funny, from the opening credits to the parody of Marvel movie finales. Deadpool 2 suffers the fate of so many sequels: we've seen its best ideas before.|Rotten
You can feel the filmmakers pulling their punches when they should be lunging for the jugular: more interested in protecting the franchise than letting the character do what we paid good money to watch him do.|Rotten
It's a great sequel that extends the world of Deadpool while also embracing what made the original so stellar.|Fresh
Overcomes its flubs by simply bulldozing through them with hyperactive pacing.|Fresh
[Deadpool 2] proves not only to be funny, but also possesses a certain flair in its action sequences. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Depending on your appetite for this stuff, the constant self-reference and breaking of the fourth wall is either a shameful cheat or a release from the sameness of the superhero template.|Fresh
Deadpool flipped the bird at superhero flicks with an irreverent, profane and hilarious meta sendup of the genre, and Deadpool 2 is more of the same.|Rotten
As is often the case in the business of follow-ups, the new effort pales in comparison to the funny, smart, sassy and, it says here, less outrageously violent original. . . It's as over the top as it gets.|Rotten
Where the original was... fresher than a boatload of day scallops, the part deux follow-up feels more like daily gruel.|Rotten
Irreverent and subversive, this amusing sequel generates plenty of big laughs, even if the freshness of the characters and the concept has dwindled from its predecessor.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is a better superhero sequel than Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, and Batman & Robin. It's also better than the original Deadpool.|Fresh
...Just about every single scene includes an aside, a wink, a direct address to the vested audience. It's like going to a party where everyone is taking selfies. It starts to feel like narcissism. It's also a significant distraction.|Fresh
Director David Leitch, replacing the original's Tim Miller, ups the action quotient while the script delivers a stronger story and even some occasional poignancy.|Fresh
Deadpool movies ought to chomp down on its targets with fangs, not gums...we wish Deadpool 2 were as irreverent, revolutionary and backbiting as it deserves to be. Now that would have been subversive.|Rotten
The one true value of Deadpool is his eagerness-and Reynolds's chatty, hyena-like motormouth is a perfect vessel-to say it all...the truth is that a lot of this winky, nudgy movie is fun if you can see beyond its evident end times subtext.|Fresh
"This is a film that is meant to be a change of pace from your run-of-the-mill superhero movie - kind of an R-rated ""Guardians of the Galaxy."""|Fresh
Deadpool 2's meta-heavy brilliance-and really, the best part of the film-comes when you stick around for the post-credits scenes.The movie's stingers are better than anything the Marvel Cinematic Universe has put out in the last 10 years.|Fresh
It's not nearly as good as the first Deadpool, but it's definitely worth seeing and 100-percent a good movie...a refreshing sequel that will keep this franchise around a long time.|Fresh
His jibber-jabber gets tiresome after a while, however, and irreverent, subversive and shocking humour is funny only upto a point. After which, the grand action scenes aside, it feels like a pattern: Offend. Kill. Make an inside Marvel joke. Repeat.|Rotten
Deadpool 2 entertains, but it doesn't compare to its predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
If you enjoyed the first film and wanted to see more of the same, you're going to have a grand time here. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
It's one of the funniest movies you'll see this year, visually spectacular and consistently entertaining.|Fresh
The Deadpool writers, and that team includes Reynolds, get to have their cake and eat it, too, with a movie they can dismiss and cherish all at the same time.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is certainly funny, but never as much as it thinks it is (apart from maybe during its truly excellent closing credits sequence).|Fresh
Really, just take the plot from Terminator 2? More of the R-rated same, so amusing, but not as novel.|Fresh
When Deadpool 2 works - and it works far more often than not - it's a riot. It's profane and insane and unpredictable.|Fresh
Nonstop violence, profanity, adult humor in super sequel.|Fresh
As Deadpool himself might say, it's a superhero film that exists to be bad for all the right reasons. So why not just go with the flow?|Fresh
Perhaps Deadpool 2 works because the title character saves most of his fury for the fourth wall.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 could easily have been a letdown. The fact that it's not is a happy surprise.|Fresh
But what does all of this really mean? Not a whole lot. It's a very fun watch, if this is what you're into.|Fresh
A superhero spectacular... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is the death of the comic-book movie. Or it should be. The savage, inhumane nihilism here says, Yup, comics haters are right: this is dangerous nonsense with no morality or redeeming qualities.|Rotten
He's back and still nasty. Does not disappoint, even better than the first.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is at its best when it cheerfully doesn't give a sh-t. The more it cared, the less I did.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 scorches those X-Men, Reynolds himself and, of course, the GOP|Fresh
With his athleticism and unerring timing, Reynolds was obviously born to don Deadpool's apparently smelly catsuit.|Fresh
The comedy is as dark as the blood in Deadpool 2, showcasing a truly inspired character's blend of invincibility and self-deprecation, flinging off one-liners faster than a machine gun spits bullets.|Fresh
An entertainingly nihilistic night out.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 ... comes equipped with enough laugh-out-loud gags, wince-inducing kills and surprising cameos to delight diehard fans and casual viewers alike.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds still looks like a hard boiled Voldemort, and he's still running that mouth like there's no Deadpool 3, but Deadpool 2 is a bigger, filthier and better movie than the original.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 embraces its enhanced output of blood, guns, and violence with open arms...before they're blown off.|Fresh
Easily in a different class to pretty much everything else out there in its genre.|Fresh
"Though in many respects Deadpool 2 is funnier, filthier and certainly better directed in the action stakes than its predecessor...it's also a film that gleefully sacrifices sacred cows while remaining reluctant to touch any labelled ""cash."""|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is even more ribald and subversive than the first film, and pulsates with sardonic, self-aware wit from the opening shot.|Fresh
It is relentless, occasionally exhausting but frequently hilarious.|Fresh
The film's greatest asset is Reynolds, who in Deadpool finally found the role of his dreams.|Fresh
In the face of this pretence of cool cynicism, the film's eventual nod to sentiment and pathos doesn't seem maudlin or ridiculous. Credit should go to Reynolds, who brings to bear the sincerity and vulnerability he's expressed before in his rom-com roles.|Fresh
It's clearly a stab at recreating grittier, more emotionally fraught origin story moments that Deadpool 1 certainly didn't shy away from, but this time it feels like the movie is trying to punch way, way above its weight class.|Rotten
It's hard to follow up on a brilliant film but Ryan Reynolds has done it again, taking risks which a studio might hesitate to take and going beyond the premise of the film in the process.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is an entirely predictable affair that, at 120 minutes, spoils itself.|Rotten
It's worth the watch for the laughs alone - especially if you, too, aren't a superhero fan.|Fresh
It's overstuffed, and essentially empty.|Rotten
There's little that's genuinely daring or subversive in Deadpool 2...|Rotten
More profanity, more Troma-esque ultra-violence, more snarky adolescent meta-commentary. In short: more Deadpool.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 does not stop being fun for a second and surprises at various points. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's not a bad movie, but it tries so hard to emulate its predecessor that you feel the screen sweating.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is bold, audacious, outrageous, and wickedly funny.|Fresh
Happily, Reynolds, who has a co-writing credit, has found a fine balance between the snappy, vulgar, perfectly-timed one-liners and the source of pain that causes the humor, Deadpool's defense mechanism.|Fresh
Some great, great meta-humor...the movie itself is very good as well.|Fresh
It felt more like an action film with a lot of comedy in it. I liked what they did and I thought it was a worthy sequel.|Fresh
I had such a ball watching this movie.|Fresh
They're all great; it's the movie around them that comes up short.|Rotten
Indeed: if the sequels' eternal challenge is how to live up to the original without repeating itself, let's say that Deadpool 2 is a worthy second part, but it does not have the advantage of [surprise]. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deliriously over-the-top from start to finish, the follow-up may not be as novel as its predecessor, but there's no denying that Deadpool 2 is hugely entertaining.|Fresh
The plot is as dispensable as the limbs of the titular character, so I do not intend to delve much into it, except to say that this sequel is exactly what comics movies need right now... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Why is Deadpool 2 so bloody winning? Chalk it up to Reynolds's/Deadpool's adherence to his own waggish sensibility.|Fresh
The irreverent R-rated humor that made 2016's 'Deadpool' such a refreshing spin on the genre returns in this juiced-up deadpan sequel.|Fresh
True to form, the film calls out its own lazy writing, which is probably the laziest writing of all.|Rotten
Deadpool returns in a sequel that manages to up the in-joking, violence, cameos and meta plot points, which will please fans but royally annoy anyone looking for a more straight-forward story.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is awesome and you should go to see it. Especially if, like me, you're suffering from a bad case of superhero fatigue. It could be good for what ails ya.|Fresh
[Julian] Dennison as the volatile Russell is the heart of the picture, providing an emotional anchor in a production that might otherwise be too snarky for its own good.|Fresh
It's so extreme, it's hilarious.|Fresh
It's not often a sequel surpasses its predecessor, but Deadpool 2 improves on the original in pretty much every way; packing in funnier jokes, better characters, and even some genuinely touching moments.|Fresh
The lesson learned before applies here: never underestimate Reynolds and his determination to pull off the impossible.|Fresh
It all boils down to one important fact: Reynolds gets these comics.|Fresh
"For good of ill, ""Deadpool 2"" delivers more of the same."|Rotten
How many times can one go back to the well? DEADPOOL was great fun because it was new, and well --- exciting. DEADPOOL 2 --- not as much.|Fresh
I'm not convinced that a third entry is necessary, or what the filmmakers can come up with to support yet another encore.|Fresh
It mostly just puts a loud, explosion-filled gloss on the same few jokes.|Rotten
As explosively funny as the movie is at times, the self-referencing comes dangerously close to ruining the moment.|Fresh
The star does his schtick and invites us in for a giggle but there's no weight to the character or to Reynolds's playing of him. He's like Robert Downey Jr. without the soul.|Rotten
A wild, non-stop avalanche of snarky humor and grossly comic violence...overall it's an improvement on its predecessor, even if it remains a patently obvious effort to adhere to the template of the superhero genre while pretending to subvert it.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 feels about as fresh as an old jelly doughnut covered with fire ants. Sure, you could eat it if you were starving, but it would never occur to you to recommend ingesting a mouthful of stinging ants and crusty pastry.|Rotten
It's offensive as hell. Gory. Ridiculously campy. But it never fails at being laugh out loud hilarious, self-deprecating to the extreme, and often unexpectedly charming and poignant, if in a completely disgusting way.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is everything that it is supposed to rail against: a generic comic book movie that is only a step above the lesser entries in the Marvel/Fox continuum.|Rotten
I'm totally fine with Deadpool 2... [but] part of me can't help but wish that, after this adventure becomes a global hit, he finally decides to shut up.|Fresh
What Deadpool 2 manages to pull off best is that it easily juggles all its characters, the old and the new, and gets them to play off Deadpool's wild and zany personality, making for a constantly engaging dynamic.|Fresh
It's funnier, more dramatic and emotional, has a better story, and has a killer supporting cast who all work tirelessly to make Deadpool 2 feel as fresh and surprising as the original.|Fresh
The majority of Deadpool 2 is a production that hits you in the gut with the action and repeatedly slams your funny bone with the often juvenile humor. That's because the team doesn't hold back a single gunshot or rimshot.|Fresh
It's in such ways that Deadpool 2 retains enough good will to get by.|Fresh
Gratuitously and graphically violent... crass and juvenile, and above all belly-achingly funny.|Fresh
It's good enough, with only a whiff of seen-it-before around the edges.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 barely pauses for breath, which is admirable given the additional cast members. It's a bigger, brasher, swearier older brother to the first film.|Fresh
Boasting of some great unsuspecting cameos, the story humanises Deadpool, without letting go of what makes him different - deviant ways, indulgence in gory violence, sarcasm and narcissism.|Fresh
A movie that often blends action and comedy with visual wit and efficiency, offering an unexpected new angle to a sequel that returns with the expected load of R-rated snark and in-jokes for movie buffs.|Fresh
I hated the first Deadpool for its quippy smugness and ultra-violence. This one is still smug, quippy, violent. But some helpful mastermind has introduced wit.|Fresh
The film is not as overfilling as the first Deadpool, and from a nerd standpoint it has a little more respect for the chrome giant Colossus than its predecessor.|Fresh
Despite lacking the freshness of 2016 feature, the sequel is funny, energetic, and determined not to take itself seriously (even when serious things happen).|Fresh
Wherever you fall, it's safe to say viewers can at least agree that it's unapologetically crude and that Ryan Reynolds once again proves he is the perfect choice to play the titular anti-hero.|Rotten
One of the new century's best comic-book movies...|Fresh
Yes, it more of the same - hardcore action sequences (in slo-mo, of course) set to cheesy-brie ballads, Deadpool demolishing the fourth wall, and plenty of dick jokes - but it's still fun.|Fresh
A superhero version of Airplane! in the frequency of its gags (some of them groaners). With the winky fourth-wall-breaking of a Bob Hope movie, only with explosions and severed limbs. To be clear, this is what I like about it.|Fresh
Ultimately, it lives or dies by how tiresome you find its hero, who is, as Cable puts it, 'a jabbering butt plug'.|Fresh
With plenty of genuine laughs, balls-out action sequences, and a whole lot of emotion and heart, this is the sequel that you'd hoped for.|Fresh
At one point, Deadpool compares the domestic grosses of the first Deadpool movie with The Passion of the Christ, which is surely what our culture's over-analysis of movie box office deserves.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is funny. Maybe not quite as funny as the first film, but the barrage of jokes - some obscured because the audience was still laughing at the last one - should stand up to multiple viewings.|Fresh
A fine sequel, with the ribald ridiculousness that is to be expected with this series. Reynolds is having the time of his life, but the newcomers steal the show.|Fresh
Die-hard fans of Deadpool's fourth wall-breaking, superhero-subverting, ultraviolent antics will find much to enjoy in Deadpool 2. Everyone else: Deadpool is basically your Poochie.|Fresh
The story is more cohesive than the first and somewhere amid all the mocking and the 37th pastiche might just be an original voice. Or, at least an original voice 2.0.|Fresh
It can't match its predecessor for originality, but the Merc With The Mouth once again brings the mirth.|Fresh
Deadpool 2's scathing critique of the 2008 credit default swap crisis is a timely reminder for the need for rigorous global financial regulation.|Fresh
"""Deadpool 2"" is annoying and bad."|Rotten
It's often very funny, but periodically Deadpool 2 has to drop the ironic facade and shoot for real emotion, and here it stumbles.|Fresh
"The quips and pop culture references come at you ""Airplane!""-style, meta times meta, breaking the fourth wall and probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh as well."|Fresh
...a joyous, violent, profane and occasionally quite sweet cinema experience worthy of the original.|Fresh
[Brolin's] beefed-up baddie and Dennison steal the thunder from Reynolds, and that's great as Reynolds' wise-cracking shtick can get annoying after a while.|Fresh
This sequel is snarky but never smug, playfully riffing on superhero cliches without falling back on them.|Fresh
There is something defeatist about a franchise that acknowledges stereotypes, tropes and clichés, then does little to circumvent them and nothing to counter them.|Rotten
It's a very fun time. I have a feeling it will improve upon multiple viewings, but it's not quite as great as the first film to me.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 arrives as a worthy sequel with a great amount of gags. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
True to form, Deadpool 2 doesn't skimp on one-liners and visual gags, many of them referencing signature moments in other movies... In a way, Deadpool 2 doesn't try to speak to the audience; it is the audience.|Fresh
If you enjoyed the guilty pleasures of Deadpool, it's an immutable law of Physics that you will love Deadpool 2.|Fresh
Upping the emotional ante, Deadpool 2 proves richer and deeper than the very good original. Plus: new-and-improved curse words and 20 percent more mayhem!|Fresh
Deadpool 2 was never going to surpass the original, but it is the second coming of something immensely fun and unlike anything else in the oversaturated superhero market. In particular are two huge set-pieces that are going to leave audiences in stitches|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is a worthy sequel for sure. Everything salacious from the first film is pretty much injected with steroids here.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 still has enough of its own qualities to work as an individual movie, that is, it does not matter if it is a sequel. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Some of the film's elements may be inconsistent, but the demented humor is always dead on.|Fresh
[Ryan Reynolds] gives a great performance in a film that's so much fun, and so swaggeringly confident, that you can't help but overlook its flaws.|Fresh
When it comes to the new faces in Deadpool 2, Zazie Beetz steals the show as Domino, and is an incredible addition to the mix.|Fresh
A deliriously violent concoction. Better than the first.|Fresh
Even at a generous running time of 120 minutes, Deadpool 2 still packs a stack of fresh, fast and furious material into the mix, which all but guarantees hard line fans will up for a repeat viewing sooner than later.|Fresh
Unfortunately, two movies in, the Deadpool franchise has not only already run out of jokes-it's become everything it was supposed to hate.|Rotten
It's a long movie and when its star isn't on screen and cracking wise, the boundary-pushing shocks and endless self-references wear thin.|Rotten
In a year where we have a superhero movie every other month, here's someone to point out the sillier aspects of the superhero craze.|Fresh
A least as funny as the original Deadpool, and better in virtually every other respect: better plot, better villains, a few unexpected narrative swerves, and, yes, at least one genuinely moving sequence.|Fresh
The sequel is not a letdown. It may not be as refreshingly clever as the first Deadpool, but it certainly delivers in laughs and lunacy.|Fresh
The result feels a bit like a lavishly produced, superhero- and supervillain-stocked standup comedy special, with fight scenes, chases and explosions spliced into footage of the hero telling you about the wild couple of weeks he just had.|Fresh
It is a fairly brilliant sendup of comic-book action movies, as well as also being an excellent example of one.|Fresh
It's smarmy and snarky - with outrageous post-credit scenes which will delight whether you're a fan of superhero sagas or sick of them.|Fresh
In the narrow prism of superhero tentpoles, Deadpool 2 refreshingly shouts, with four-letter words aplenty, that there is more to cinema than one-size-fits-all blockbuster boilerplate.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is a tighter, smarter, better version of its predecessor.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 utilizes the character's popularity as a MacGuffin for more rapid-fire jokes, but errs too far on the side of that clownishness to stick the landing once director David Leitch pivots to a payoff that's (slightly) more serious.|Fresh
Maybe not as [good as the first] since the element of shock and awe can't be put back into its bottle, but anyone who enjoyed [his origin tale] should have as much fun.|Fresh
After the heaviness of Avengers: Infinity War, Deadpool 2 arrives just in time to pants the comic book movie genre with more hilarity and craziness than before.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 offers a glorious sugar high, but that inevitably means it comes crashing back to Earth.|Fresh
Pure entertainment with storytelling that achieves a level of fun few superhero movies are able to achieve without pandering to the fans.|Fresh
'One of the guys who killed the dog in John Wick' has delivered a genuinely moving family film, albeit an R-rated one with pedophile jokes, and one of the rare instances where a sequel surpasses the original.|Fresh
"""Deadpool 2"" is as entertainingly distasteful (perhaps even more) than the first movie."|Fresh
"""Deadpool 2"" is funnier and more action-packed than its predecessor. Filled with unconventional kills, four-letter words, sexual references, and even more idiosyncratic kills that leave a high, but comedic, bodycount, fans will be thrilled."|Fresh
While he's migrated from the dead of winter to prime summer blockbuster season, Deadpool hasn't gone soft with success.|Fresh
It's relentless, often exhausting and frequently hilarious.|Fresh
Wants so badly to be something more interesting than it really is.|Rotten
As with the original, Deadpool 2 thrives on tone over narrative.|Fresh
The temptation might have been to go brasher yet, rather boldly, Deadpool 2 goes deeper and expands its core cast appealingly, making for a sequel that's not only funnier but more ambitious and satisfying.|Fresh
Rather than face its own moral incoherence, Deadpool 2 blinks.|Rotten
Seriously subversive, seriously funny, seriously profane, occasionally even serious, Deadpool 2 is the best kind of cinematic entertainment. Seriously.|Fresh
It's Family Guy: The Movie.|Rotten
Bigger, funnier and filthier than the first film, Deadpool 2 doesn't disappoint, delivering a potent cocktail of action and humour.|Fresh
High-energy raucous fun, Deadpool 2 is a hoot: a rollicking, no holds barred explosion of irreverence and action, wired with violence, language and attitude.|Fresh
For the snotty little brother of 20th Century Fox's crown jewel franchise that it aims to be, Deadpool 2 is clever enough in its giddily obnoxious way.|Fresh
Bigger, badder, funnier, and more meta than ever,Deadpool 2is the overstuffed chimichanga of awesomeness we were hoping it would be.|Fresh
Bless its profane, bloody, fourth wall-breaking heart.|Fresh
Doesn't build on the first film, choosing instead to replay the greatest hits. If you're a fan of those hits, then you'll enjoy this encore, but anyone who wasn't amused by the first go-round isn't going to hop on board for this do-over.|Fresh
Better than the first one. Funnier and more bananas, with better action and a better plot. Ryan Reynolds crushes it once again. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film's impulse to profess a knowing, snarky superiority can become painfully awkward.|Rotten
The Deadpool movies occasionally push the bounds of taste, but they don't take real comedic risks. Viewed as more of an action-comedy, then, Deadpool 2 works passably well. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is far more ambitious than the first film, elevating the action, humor and overall scope for an even more fun experience in the sequel.|Fresh
Despite a tendency toward elephantitis in story and scope, not to mention blatant franchise pandering, Deadpool 2 still plays like the runt of the comic-book litter. We mean that as a compliment.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 has as much heart as the original, and the humour is more consistent. And while we wondered whether Wade Wilson's brand of comedy had had its day, the series has moved with the times and feels as relevant and contemporary as it could be.|Fresh
In two years, Deadpool has gone from the scrappy class clown to the annoying wiseass in the back of the room spewing crude insults to amuse himself.|Rotten
As Deadpool 2 unfolds, we come to see that beneath the wisecracks, it is very sincerely about the importance of family in everyone's lives.|Fresh
Caustic and unexpected.|Fresh
A movie that feels scribbled in pencil crayon, drenched in Jolt cola and coated with the dust of a thousand discarded bags of Flamin' Hot Cheetos... As it is, Deadpool 2 is a film that is merely aggressively aggressive.|Rotten
If you enjoyed the first one, there's every chance you'll like this one as well. Similarly, if you hated the first one, you probably won't find much to love about the follow-up either.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 ups the ante by delivering a bigger and ballsier sequel.|Fresh
Snappy, self-aware, fourth-wall-breaking lines like that flow fast and rarely miss their targets in the ensuing adventure.|Fresh
While Deadpool 2 delivers the gags and the gun-shot geeky Marvel insider references, the plot could have done with some more finesse.|Rotten
If the filmmakers were as self-reflexive as they pretend to be, they'd find a way to show that Deadpool's insides are becoming as charred as his face.|Rotten
In the age of constantly escalating superhero stakes, Deadpool stays fresh by aiming small.|Fresh
Every cultural moment needs a smart-ass, and sometimes, you take what you can get.|Fresh
Surprisingly we didn't hear any cracks about sequels that suck, perhaps because Reynolds, Leitch, and the rest know that this one doesn't.|Fresh
This ultra-violent sequel to one of the most successful R-rated movies of all time is often hilarious, but the skeleton holding it together can't really hold up its end of the bargain. For most people, though, that will be OK.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 makes a point of not taking itself too seriously, which can be harder than it looks. And if that works somewhat fitfully, the sequel delivers consistently enough to keep this colorful mercenary laughing all the way to the bank.|Fresh
That said, as someone who remains fond of its predecessor, the Merc with a Mouth's eagerly anticipated sequel... is a superior sort of tongue-in-cheek men-in-tights work.|Fresh
Deadpool is no longer the underdog making good, but the focal point of a very prolific franchise. And he kinda can't be that.|Fresh
Much like its predecessor, Deadpool 2 is less a movie than a smirky, feature-length meme generator.|Rotten
Where it surprises - and why it works so well - is how it balances an actually touching undercurrent alongside superhero subversiveness.|Fresh
From start to finish - and especially through the now-mandatory post-credit scenes - Reynolds delivers every punch, kick and hard-edged witticism with conviction and relish.|Fresh
Saucy, overstuffed and very entertaining.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is about as funny and action-packed and entertaining as Deadpool was, which is good news for fans, and bad news for entitled fanboys who demand every sequel be some kind of cinematic revelation...|Fresh
Deadpool proved that audiences were hungry for a superhero as self-aware as they are; Deadpool 2 proves that character can actually ground an ensemble.|Fresh
Filthy, ferocious and funny to a near-indecent degree, Deadpool 2 bests its predecessor by doubling down on the gleefully self-aware source comics' idea that anything worth doing is worth overdoing: excess and escalation are, essentially, in its DNA.|Fresh
Unfortunately the new sequel... doesn't have enough of too much; less charitable viewers might even argue that it has too much of not enough.|Rotten
Dizzy fun for a while, like eating Twinkies on a Gravitron. Eventually, though, it just wears you out.|Fresh
Although it runs short on plot, Deadpool 2 delivers a sequel that's crasser, gorier, and funnier than its predecessor.|Fresh
With its uncompromising commitment to gross-out injuries, nerdy pop culture in-jokes and inappropriate touching, Deadpool 2 was clearly made to cater to existing fans with every innuendo-filled moment...|Fresh
The eagerness of Deadpool to call out its own shortcomings earns this trash-talking franchise a lot of goodwill.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 isn't a complete bust, but it's missing a chunk of what made me look back so fondly on Deadpool.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 isn't as immortalized as Deadpool 1, but I still enjoyed myself.|Fresh
Wisecracking and fourth wall-breaking as ever.|Fresh
"We'd say it's the rare sequel that surpasses the original - but as Deadpool would put it: ""That's just lazy writing."""|Fresh
Led by Ryan Reynolds as the Merc with a Mouth, Deadpool 2 is a wildly entertaining ride that ups the stakes after 2016's hit predecessor.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is, above all else, a lot of fun. Sometimes it maybe doesn't take itself seriously enough. But in a genre that takes itself so deadly seriously, this is like a breath of fresh air.|Fresh
A delirious exhibition for the bawdy, acerbic humor of Ryan Reynolds.|Fresh
Comes blazing out of the shoot, but dips in its second hour, like a stretched-out piece of taffy. Still, there is a lot left to like here, and Reynolds and company crank out better, more outrageous laughs than most pure comedies.|Fresh
What drives this franchise is the same force that drives so much culture and politics right now: the self-pity of a white man with a relentless need to be the center of attention.|Rotten
Reynolds, one of three credited writers, took more creative control with this sequel. That may sound like trouble, but the innate self-effacement built into the actor's breezy motormouth skill set apparently kept his better instincts at the fore.|Fresh
With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy and back fluidly, occasionally even making room to go warm and mushy.|Fresh
A fine, funny and filthy comic book superhero sequel that makes sure to be a coherent and entertaining movie first and a giant self-referential in-joke second.|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is kind of like that zany guy you met at a party once. Yeah, he was fun that first time out. But when you meet him again, he's just more of the same and that's ... boring.|Rotten
Deadpool 2 muddies the distinction between parodying comic-book-movie conventions and perfunctorily adhering to them.|Rotten
The sequel recaptures more than enough of the first film's impish spirit to provide a big, raucous, bloody good time.|Fresh
With higher highs and lower lows than Deadpool, the sequel has a lot of the problems all sequels do.|Fresh
"Deadpool 2 is an overstuffed cinematic burrito of raunchy insults, dismembering violence and a ""no f#*ks given"" attitude that's ready to burst at any second, but somehow holds together bite after enjoyable bite."|Fresh
"Deadpool 2 is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements, terrific ensemble work -- and for dessert, perhaps the best end-credits ""cookie"" scene ever."|Fresh
In almost every respect, this sequel is an improvement on its 2016 predecessor: Sharper, grosser, more narratively coherent and funnier overall, with a few welcome new additions.|Fresh
Le ratio de gags hilarants semble beaucoup plus élevé dans ce second volet. [Full review in French]|Fresh
Deadpool 2 is an outrageous, surprising, hysterical, emotional, vulgar, creative and uproarious summer blockbuster that fans of this genre -- and of comedy, in general -- will devour.|Fresh
A filthier, funnier sequel that doesn't try so hard to be irreverent.|Fresh
Still the only comic book superhero movie smart and witty enough to mock comic book superhero movies.|Fresh
The perfect Avengers antidote.|Fresh
"The original ""Deadpool"" caught lightning in a bottle. The sequel sparks only intermittently."|Fresh
He's back and he's as hilarious, homicidal and outrageous as ever, although maybe a little mushier.|Fresh
You may come for the action, I'm in for the decidedly punchy jokes and, now don't freak out, the surprisingly pungent emotion. Yup. This superhero spoof is laugh out loud funny, blows a whole lot of stuff up and is full of heart. Go figure.|Fresh
