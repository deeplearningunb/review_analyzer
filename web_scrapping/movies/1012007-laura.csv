Preminger deals in facades, with how perception cheats us, right down to the ideal image of Laura as a portrait. (Cinmathque Annotations on Film)|Fresh
This is an exquisite transfer of one of cinema's most beloved noirs, with a modest offering of special features that focus on the film's culturally significant history.|Fresh

Preminger made darker, more characteristically noir films than this, but his only movie that's as good, or perhaps better, is Anatomy of a Murder.|Fresh
Will leave you drunk with delight.|Fresh
The dialogue is stinging and the performances to be savoured in a haunting study of romantic obsession that deserves its return to the big screen.|Fresh
Laura is still every bit as gripping in 2012.|Fresh

This interesting film noir has more working for its final half than in its first.|Fresh
Expertly paced, gripping, and dripping with sensuality, Otto Preminger's Laura has hardly aged a day.|Fresh
O roteiro , na melhor das hipteses, medocre, mas a direo sombria de Preminger, a msica-tema e as atuaes de Webb e Price transformam este filme em um marco importante do nascente noir.|Fresh
Great suspense.|Fresh

It is the sleekest of murder mysteries, and ahead of its time -- not least in having a gay suitor for Laura, and possibly two.|Fresh

The plot is deliberately perfunctory, the people deliciously perverse, and the mise-en-scne radical.|Fresh
A camp classic of a very particular variety.|Fresh
Classic in the true sense with great theme music to boot.|Fresh
A classic noir romance where all of the cinematic elements fit together perfectly.|Fresh
Just watching Clifton Webb's deliciously nasty performance, as the effete critic and Laura's mentor, delivering the film's best lines, is worth the price of admission|Fresh

The noir film as we know it today was in its infancy in 1944, but Laura is one of the movies that brought it to age.|Fresh
The story is a good whodunnit, although it probably isn't half as clever as a mystery as it is a character study.|Fresh

A masterfully complex -- and frequently campy -- portrait of all-consuming romantic self-delusion.|Fresh

A classic thriller/whodunit of the 1940s. Unfortunately, it remains solidly in the past.|Fresh
A classic murder film worth seeing over and over.|Fresh
Did Hollywood ever produce a more seductive mystery or a creepier romance? I wouldn't change a line, a frame, or a performance in this film.|Fresh
