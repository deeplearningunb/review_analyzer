Ant-Man and The Wasp brings the fun, humor, and action - and also some AMAZING girl power! The Wasp shines in her new found role, and Ant-Man is clearly the back up.|Fresh
Like the original film, [Paul] Rudd's boyish charm takes Ant-Man and the Wasp further than it should go, and he's an absolute delight to watch as Marvel's most incompetent hero.|Fresh
A hilarious action-packed adventure with great replay value. It's mindless enough to suck you in without making your head hurt with insipid plot lines and hilarious enough to keep you invested.|Fresh
When it counts, the action fairly zings along, yet it is the little things - appropriately enough - that set the movie's tone.|Fresh
The CGI impresses. However, the characters supersede the special effects.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp lands the occasional knee-slapping banter and has a playful energy, but it doesn't leave a lasting sting. Evangeline Lilly is the MVP.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun sequel that doesn't match the wit and originality of the first movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
DC's Wonder Woman has proved audiences are definitely hungry for superhero films with female protagonists, so while the Wasp is an enjoyable step in the right direction, this reviewer is more than ready for more.|Fresh
This feels like the movie Oceans 8 should've been.|Fresh

This feels like the movie Oceans 8 should've been.|Fresh
It's a decent superhero movie with some fun moments.|Fresh
More ingenious than its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There is nothing ground breaking about what Marvel is doing here, but there is so much fun to be had with these people and this world that nothing was going to shrink the smile on my face.|Fresh
[Ant-Man and the Wasp] is funny and sweet, a more grounded story that serves as a welcome respite from the upward-spiraling stakes we've been getting.|Fresh
It absolutely blows the previous Ant-Man film out of the water. The film is also full of heart too which makes this a pretty decent film to watch with the whole family.|Fresh
Bottom line: The film was funny.|Fresh
The first big failure of Marvel's Phase 3|Rotten
A fun story, but it felt like an episode of a TV series that, while you liked it, you won't really remember it amongst all the other really great episodes that came before it.|Fresh
The success of his first superhero movie has allowed director Peyton Reed to loosen the reins, and the results are much sure-footed and humorous this time around.|Fresh
Minor Marvel is still a step above other blockbusters|Fresh
Lighthearted and humorous, Ant-Man and the Wasp is surprisingly refreshing.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a load of Marvel goodness, with enjoyably spirited characters, exuberant action scenes, characterization improvements and a fun comedic edge that is sure to be an antidote to high-stakes drama of Avengers: Infinity War.|Fresh
Of course, Rudd shows he is worthy of a title role as well, not only as Ant-Man but also as Scott Lang.|Fresh
Make no mistake Ant-Man and the Wasp is better than its predecessor. It's more unique, better paced, and funnier than the previous Ant-Man film.|Fresh
It is a wonderful film with great action and a terrific dive into the Quantum Realm. If the first movie was your cup of tea, then you will love this one.|Fresh
Si la única razón de la existencia de esta secuela es para que Marvel pueda jactarse de tener otra heroína en sus filas, fácilmente esperábamos Capitana Marvel y así nos ahorrábamos dos de las horas más banales que el MCU nos ha ofrecido hasta ahora.|Fresh
Like its pint-sized superhero, the film doesn't quite fit in with the typical MCU big screen canon and is a laid back yet thoroughly forgettable entry into the fatigued superhero genre.|Rotten
Ant-Man And The Wasp is simply a fun summer family film, but does not reach the heights or standard that Marvel has built over Phase 3.|Rotten
In comparison to other MCU films, the story is lacking, to be quite honest, but the cast's energy and rapport together kept me enjoying every minute of it all throughout.|Fresh
These flourishes keep Ant-Man and the Wasp light on its feet...and it doubles down on the first film's fathers-and-daughters themes to moderately heart-warming effect.|Fresh
Unlike some of the bigger Marvel movies, this one succeeds by going small (pardon the pun) and focusing on one unique family.|Fresh
This won't become anybody's favourite Marvel movie, but at this point in their timeline, a gentle character comedy is exactly the movie we need from them.|Fresh
Marvel Studios provides yet another captivating film, but its lasting impact will be far less than pretty much every other entry into the MCU.|Fresh
An engaging superhero film that will genuinely appeal to both adults and children. Not knuckle-whiteningly exciting, but the humour perfectly undercuts the typical blockbuster dialogue whenever it threatens to fall into sentimentality or cod-physics.|Fresh
In essence, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a rich man's Thor: The Dark World, a film that serves as much an episodic purpose as a cinematic one if not more so.|Fresh
One of the most enjoyable movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with both of the titular characters holding their own in every aspect of the film.|Fresh
Incredibly entertaining and exactly the antidote for a series of movies that were growing overstuffed beyond the point of exhaustion.|Fresh
This could well be the least extended-preview-for-the-next-one MCU installment since Iron Man 3.|Fresh
A well-needed break from genocide-clicking titans, this breezy sequel is adequately entertaining, but vastly forgettable.|Rotten
Stop turning these movies into homework, they're supposed to be fun - sit through the credits, you'll get your answers.|Fresh
"Three years ago, I proclaimed the first Ant-Man, ""the perfect chaser to cleanse the palette from the last superhero jam while getting us queued for the next one."" That description is applicable in its entirety to this sequel as well."|Fresh
It's a welcome change of pace that reminds us that superhero films can be easy, breezy fun instead of heavy-handed spectacle.|Fresh
"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is fantastically enjoyable and one of the most brisk entries in the MCU, even if it doesn't seem all that important to the bigger picture."|Fresh
Strong action and strong jokes. With nothing to top the stakes of Infinity War, it was the perfect end cap for the MCU's 2018 roster.|Fresh
"It's not better than or funnier than ""Thor: Ragnarok. But it has some great laughs and Lang's relationship with his daughter may be the most meaningful father-daughter relationship in the MCU outside Hank and Hope Van Dyne."|Fresh
These heroes may be tiny, but the fun is big - real big.|Fresh
One of the biggest victories of Ant-Man and the Wasp is that, like Civil War before it, it lets Rudd be Rudd.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp zips along at a delightful pace thanks to a script full of zingers and self-awareness and Peyton Reed's keen eye behind the camera.|Fresh
Full of action, fun, humour, colour and Michael Douglas, if you simply want a good old superhero flick, you won't be disappointed here.|Fresh
One of the finest, most distinctive Marvel productions yet gets an expectedly sterling home-video release.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp feeds into a longstanding trope about disability and doesn't even seem to realize it's doing it.|Fresh
As was the case with 2015's Ant-Man, it's nice to see a Marvel movie with a self-contained plotline.|Fresh
A fun romp with likeable characters. It is a breath of fresh air within the larger continuity of the MCU.|Fresh
Now that the dust has settled, Marvel is back with a lighter, lesser sequel in the form of Ant-Man and the Wasp, a change of pace that's too busy to be breezy.|Rotten
It deftly revels in its own ridiculousness, never shying away from how outrageous its narrative ultimately is.|Fresh
With Ant-Man and the Wasp, Peyton Reed gives us a sequel that delivers everything you would want from a follow-up to the original, including plenty of exciting action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a marvelous cast to bring it all to life.|Fresh
[Evangeline Lilly's] Wasp is the ... provider of the film's backbone and the answer to why part two surpasses the first - if only by half an ant.|Fresh
Provides a good dose of refreshing fun|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is an explosion of creativity and charisma.|Fresh
This film is much funnier than most MCU films, and like 'Guardians' has unexpected heart. Rudd rocks it as a comedic actor this time around, with Peyton utilizing his talents|Fresh
Chicanos love Moz. Also: Practical fashion for Hope van Dyne might foreshadow fewer high heels for female heroes in future MCU films. Not holding breath, but fingers crossed!|Fresh
With a touch of romance and the promise of more sequels, the film is a superhero treat for ordinary mortals.|Fresh
"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is beige; but (in the words of Australian comic Billy Birmingham as beloved cricket commentator Richie Benaud), it's also cream, bone, off-white and perhaps ivory."|Rotten
Great fun, a great cast overall...the best thing that Ant-Man and the Wasp delivers is fun. This is just antics, fun gags, all sorts of sides and shenanigans. The best stuff is bite-sized entertainment.|Fresh
The right kind of light hearted action-adventure needed during a year of ultra-serious Marvel superhero fare, although the lack of a truly memorable villain dilutes the stakes somewhat.|Fresh
The special effects in this movie are fantastic...It just looks dope...seamless.|Fresh
"As the 20th film in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" finds itself somewhere in the middle. But in a series with very few misses, that's a pretty good place to land."|Fresh
I'm all for it...both heroes are pure fun.|Fresh
I still liked the first Ant-Man better.|Fresh
This is a high priced sitcom.|Fresh
It's comforting to know these chapters can still resonate while embracing their role as throwaways. [This filler is] self-aware enough to unapologetically do its thing.|Fresh
In terms of large pieces of plot or character reveals...not a lot happened in this movie that was shatteringly significant for the future of the MCU--until the post-credit scene.|Fresh
This movie is more moments, performances, characters, and specific jokes than it is looking at the [film in] total...but it's entertaining.|Fresh
A charming, fun and entertaining ride all along the way.|Fresh
The comedy worked very well for the film, but I can't help the feeling that some of those comedic scenes went a little long.|Fresh
It's more than happy to deliver a fun-filled movie evening, one that's both light-hearted and light-weight.|Fresh
"In ""short,"" it's a pretty good time!"|Fresh
It's a movie that's meant to entertain, and does, but just cannot rise above being enjoyable in the moment.|Fresh
Ant-Man and The Wasp is full of color and energy, goofball personalities and obsessed geniuses, lost loves and giant insects. It uses small ideas for big payoffs.|Fresh
It's featherweight fun that won't change your life, but that's perfectly OK.|Fresh
Offers little (no pun intended) to the entire large scope of the MCU, but as a self-contained fun summer blockbuster that only cares to have fun and for audiences to have a good time, it delivers.|Fresh
Marvel's sequel, 'Ant-Man and The Wasp,' is just as much fun as the first film and includes some even faster paced action|Fresh
Two generations of Ant-Men and Wasps fight alongside one another and learn what it means to be family, and it is never less than utterly delightful.|Fresh
Who would have thought all it took for this critic to unabashedly like an MCU movie again was a big heart and Paul Rudd's hairy chest? This Marvel hater liked it, so give it a go.|Fresh
[It's] light, fluffy and jiggly at times, it's sweet enough, but without a lot of real substance.|Rotten
Peyton Reed and the creatives behind Ant-Man dropped their latest installment of the MCU comedy as a cinematic reminder to take a breath. Everything is going to be okay, kids.|Fresh
A Fun MCU Movie With Family At Its Core|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp isn't the worst Marvel movie ever, but it might be the most inconsequential... Eventually, repetition in action and tone neuter the film's creative energy.|Rotten
Ant-Man and the Wasp is surreal fun. It moves swift but you're laughing the whole time, largely because of the character Scott Lang (Paul Rudd).|Fresh
You can feel the strain, a bit, for laughs in the first 15 minutes but once you settle into the movie's goofy warmth, and relatively chill vibe (well, as chill as superhero movies get that is), it's quite a fun adventure.|Fresh
This is just filling - something to hold over hungry movie-goers - until the next Avengers movie drops next year.|Rotten
The best thing about this movie is, I want to say, Evangeline Lily.|Fresh
Its intent is limited to amusing and diverting for a couple of hours of high-summer fun. That it does.|Fresh
Paul Rudd is always the affable hero and this film makes great use of tropes that have become stale elsewhere in the MCU.|Fresh
It's the rare Marvel movie you wish had a little more action.|Rotten
This a film that's difficult to actively dislike - Rudd and his equally charming co-stars take care of that - and fun in the moment, but there's precious little that lingers after the credits roll.|Fresh
An old-school, primary-coloured charm is detectable - there isn't really a big arch-nemesis, for example - and most welcome.|Fresh
There's a lot to be said for a superhero film in which the entire world isn't at stake, and where everyone isn't worrying about a skyscraper falling on their heads.|Fresh
The lighter, throat-clearing Marvel episodes are a great deal more digestible than the over-stuffed showstoppers. Ant-Man and The Wasp is not the equal of the hilarious Thor Ragnarok, but it never climbs too far up its own quantum realm.|Fresh
Just when things start getting boring, Rudd is on hand to reassure us, and the film's ending is a great deal of fun.|Fresh
Rudd - who claims a screenwriting credit too - is likeable, funny and plays it with just the right amount of tongue in cheek not to undo all his good work.|Fresh
Ant-Man & The Wasp, the studio's first release post-Thanos clicking those fingers, is a breezy, heart-warming romp that plants its tongue firmly in its cheek.|Fresh
It's perfectly enjoyably fare from the Marvel roster that doesn't do a whole lot to stand out but looks good doing its own thing.|Fresh
'Ant-Man and the Wasp' offer laughs, adventure, and a stinger at the end.|Fresh
Once again Marvel have served up a film with all the edges blunted, where even a little passionate smooching is rendered ridiculous and sexless.|Rotten
It may not be as significant to the Marvel canon as, say, Black Panther but the skittish wit and playfulness wins us over.|Fresh
A mild improvement over its lackluster predecessor...|Fresh
It is silly, but after the far more dramatic Avengers: Infinity War, it's a welcome light relief.|Fresh
Paul Rudd's ability to keep ex-con/single-dad/reluctant superhero Scott Lang simultaneously sceptical, confused and committed to the sci-fi chaos around him without ever going boringly square-jawed is nothing less than the purest movie-star charisma.|Fresh
A decent and rollicking summer holiday movie compared to most others, but miniature in the grand scheme of Marvel.|Fresh
With a less appealing actor in the title role, the Ant-Man films wouldn't be half as enjoyable.|Fresh
A film in which the minuscule can quickly become monumental.|Fresh
After 19 Marvel movies so far, and a growing sense of global self-importance (commercially and culturally), a throwaway superhero film is, in fact, just what we need.|Fresh
The two great enemies of picnic now get co-billing in this hilarious, delightful and somehow downright lovable entertainment from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.|Fresh
"I'm tired of saying ""the special effects are great"" when nothing else in a movie is. But, yes, it's spectacularly staged."|Fresh
The storyline feels a little thin and moth-eaten in parts but this sequel is plenty of fun.|Fresh
There are times in the cinema when you realise you're in complete agreement with that old Spinal Tap pearl of wisdom - the one about being jealous of yourself.|Fresh
The set-pieces feel somewhat expected, thankfully there's still plenty of witty banter and inventive filmmaking touches to keep the audience entertained.|Fresh
This all makes for a gleefully entertaining, down to earth, two hours.|Fresh
The humour and unflappable comedic timing of its cast remains the franchise's strength, and entertaining action sequences manage to uplift an ultimately heavy-handed sequel.|Fresh
"After a shaky first act, it becomes the bright, buoyant action-comedy ""Ant-Man"" should have been."|Fresh
Want a tightly packed bundle of fast dialogue, heady danger and speculation as to which stars are coming back for a third film? Ant-Man and the Wasp is that ticket.|Fresh
The willingness to go breezy and small scale is extremely welcome.|Fresh
... A wild ride, using visual effects to play with size and scale in absurd and exciting ways.|Fresh
A movie that is so top-to-bottom fun that it's hard to believe the same studio put out the doomsday spectacle that is Avengers: Infinity War a mere two months ago.|Fresh
With a little inventiveness and charm to spare, it succeeds by charting its own course through the MCU, and I hope there are more lighthearted, character-driven adventures in this dysfunctional family's future.|Fresh
A refreshingly different and delightful spectacle that also excels as a rip-roaring, fast-paced and engaging diversion.|Fresh
In another context, I might say that the film was simply on par with the original but here it serves as a good chaser to the unsatisfying INFINITY WAR cliffhanger.|Fresh
An entertaining summer refreshment. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The chemistry between Rudd and Lily is more than worthy. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sadly, the movie has a hard time picking a villain to stick with... That coupled with a flat ending... results in Ant-Man and the Wasp just barely making it past passable, without earning itself a spot in the ranks of summer romp.|Rotten
You won't mistake Ant-Man and the Wasp for anything particularly deep or even all that ambitious, but it is certainly a fun diversion.|Fresh
It's an enormously fun film, but there's no way it can match up to Marvel's recent hot streak.|Fresh
While the screenplay isn't as strong as it could be, the action scenes deliver in a big way.|Fresh
The chaos is very funny and the final sequence is very entertaining, but it lacks enough substance to generate any sort of dramatic connection. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ant-Man and Wasp is a concise, light and funny film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Michael Peña's performance is the most memorable. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A Marvel film giving off the repeated vibe that in some other space and time, Pixar might have made it.|Fresh
It serves as welcome respite, but essentially Marvel has followed its most consequential movie with its least.|Fresh
With a self-contained storyline and plenty of laughs, Ant-Man and The Wasp is the perfect follow-up to the chaos of Infinity War.|Fresh
A light, funny action film, this is not as dark as many Marvel films. Usually, in these films, the heroes are trying to save the world. This time, the stakes are more modest. It is more of a personal journey, which is a nice change of pace.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a family film - about nuclear families, grieving families, broken families, found families. It's about fighting for the safety of your family.|Fresh
It's a funny, charming, and perfectly fine movie to make you forget about life for an hour or two. Still, for those looking for something more, this movie is not that. It's a Saturday-morning cartoon, brought to life.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is far from being among the highlights of the genre..., but the good thing is that it does not pretend [to be], because it is aware of its inconsistency within the MCU universe. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a respite, a fast-moving, cleverly written follow-up that offers up consistent laughs, refreshingly low stakes, and plenty of sight gags.|Fresh
Good summer fun, and better than the first.|Fresh
The non-sequitur scenes are the movie's highlights.|Fresh
White it may seem to have very little at stake - it's not the emotional powerhouse that some of the other Marvel movies are - it's a sheer joy, a breath of fresh air.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is an intelligent, funny, fast-paced Marvel movie, ideal for school-holiday viewing.|Fresh
Like the last installment, this Ant-Man film does indeed deliver all of the things we look for in an MCU filler, while also staking a small place for itself.|Fresh
So Ant-Man and the Wasp is worthwhile, if not a must-see, appealing less for its thundering action than for its throwaway gags.|Fresh
Ant-Man does not pretend to be anything other than a film where the titular hero moves on a flying ant. And that is surely appreciated. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Barely an hour has passed since I saw it, and it has already been reduced to dust in my memory.|Rotten
Apart from being a romance, Ant-Man and the Wasp is also the funniest Marvel film you'll see.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a buzz-worthy blockbuster.|Fresh
The Ant-man sequel is a thrilling fun ride that engages you emotionally and amuses you with its CGI antics and comic demeanour.|Fresh
It's enjoyable enough, even for those who would rather eat broken glass than sit through another elephantine CGI-fest from the damned Marvel Comics Universe.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp blends the superhero film with comedy without feeling disjointed. More jokes landed than in most films of this combination of genres, which makes this more like a superhero comedy than a superhero film with comedic relief.|Fresh
The stellar ensemble has no trouble nailing the humor while keeping suspense high and conveying some serious stakes. It's a unique and highly entertaining ride I can't wait to go on again.|Fresh
Even by Mouse House standards, this is puerile stuff. Plus a waste of serious comic talent.|Rotten
If this movie were a carbohydrate it'd definitely be about as complex as white bread. But admittedly, it is pretty interesting if you've ever been curious what a literal small and low stakes MCU movie looks like.|Fresh
[The movie] makes us feel small and gives us the thrill of what it would feel like to be that tiny. It's a cartoon take on Gulliver's Travels - which is the delicious gimmick at the heart of the Ant-Man franchise... and impossible to resist.|Fresh
Unquestionably, the recognition of The Wasp/Evangeline Lily's superhero's name in the film's title is an intelligent choice--along with the choice to center on family.|Fresh
The film's larger-than-life humor and relatively low-stakes ground it in a way the MCU needed after Avengers: Infinity War with a much more personal story.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is, after all, a film about protecting and sacrificing for one's family, and it's love that binds such relationships together. And perhaps, Reed suggests, it's love that binds the rest of us as well.|Fresh
If you're still rocking back and forth in the foetal position after Infinity War, here's something to cheer you up a little. Great fun.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp may be light fare when compared to the other Marvel films, but just like its predecessor, it still manages to pack a pretty big punch where it counts.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp has another problem: the nonexistence of a charismatic antagonistic character.|Rotten
The action sequences are seamless, funny and, with their use of big-small toggles, ever surprising and fresh.|Fresh
The action sequences are the most ingenious, with different uses of the suit, many of them accompanied with meta humor and some very nice gags that have to do with [the] technology's malfunction. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Therefore, in addition to being a simple plot, it is feignedly complex. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
It does its job, has Paul Rudd being charming, brings The Wasp in as a full character, delivers on the action, and leaves with a mic drop of a post-credits sequence that had the audience gasping.|Fresh
A light, fun side adventure that has a lot more fun with the premise and universe of Ant-Man...|Fresh
It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it achieves its mission to further the storyline within the MCU at large. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
But despite its good points, not everything is honey over flakes because despite having good visual effects, the assembly feels a little lost in certain parts. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A lot of humor and the entire movie is geared to a family audience. My favorite of the Marvel movies. It is MARVEL-ous!|Fresh
Big things again come in small packages, and this year's summer blockbuster message regarding the importance of family and trusting your circle of friends continues here in the most entertaining of ways.|Fresh
With its convoluted screenplay as well as FX sequences of numbing repetition, it would be easy to completely write off Ant-Man and the Wasp. Yet what largely redeems it are the central characters and the performers who fill out those roles.|Fresh
At least one of us is way up to here with these comic book-based tales.|Rotten
As an action comedy, Ant-Man and the Wasp hits all the marks.|Fresh
Comic book fun and comic book shallow.|Rotten
Just two and a half months after having premiered Avengers Infinity War, Ant-Man the Wasp is the movie that Marvel Cinematic Universe needed. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Marvel Studios succeeds again and this sequel makes it clear that in the future, Ant-Man could become an even more important character in the MCU. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Where is the climax? Where is the suspense there? Where the emotion? The story that was so applauded three summers ago has lost all dimension, all its fabulous dimension. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Paul Rudd is resourceful, self-deprecating and capable of making the most of the thinnest material.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp delivers what it promises. Maybe a little more. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sweetly shrinking, surreal sci-fi - marking the first MCU movie feature a female superhero's name in the title...|Fresh
After the galactic annihilation of Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel lowers the stakes and amps up the fun with Ant-Man and the Wasp.|Fresh
Here's the surprising good news: lightning has struck twice. Everything I enjoyed about the first movie is repeated successfully. It's funny, imaginative, full of action-not violent action-and knockout visual effects that serve the story|Fresh
Cheerfully (and fittingly) small in scale, with personal stakes rather than fate-of-the-world stuff and a director who doesn't pretend it's anything more than that.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is one fun ride which never loses its steam.|Fresh
It's all disposable and inconsequential fun, and enough to tide audiences over for the next power-packed, supersized extravaganza.|Fresh
This is a breezy, fast-paced sequel that goes out of its way to provoke buckets of laughter and massive sighs of wide-eyed awe.|Fresh
Mostly improves upon everything the original film did.|Fresh
What is there not to like about watching a bad guy get knocked off of his speeding motorcycle by a giant Pez dispenser bouncing down the road?|Fresh
Barely fresh. Some fun bits. A half hour too long for what it is. Superhero fatigue setting in.|Fresh
Marvel's latest is a delightful stand-alone film that'll also leave fans with an unfamiliar feeling: uncertainty.|Fresh
The way Ant-Man and the Wasp change their sizes to surprise bad guys or accomplish some kind of task puts a smile on your face at the same time that it's generating excitement.|Fresh
Lily emerges from the shadows and becomes a true half of a perfect whole, and she and Rudd play beautifully off of each other, executing terrific timing both physically and comedically.|Fresh
"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is another great example of what comic book movies should be: a good time."|Fresh
But, like Ant-Man, who gets woozy when he stretches too tall, the movie gets into trouble whenever it tries to go big.|Rotten
In a summer of indistinguishable franchise entries, this is one not to swat away.|Fresh
"Unlike the unaccountably dull ""Ant-Man"" feature that came and went three years ago, this one tangles us up cheerfully, almost instantly, in its high-tech bedazzlements and witty beguilements, never loosening its grip."|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is fun on a bite-sized scale, and it is everything that it wants to be.|Fresh
And while the fights and stunts are occasionally eye-catching, those eyes often end up wandering off as the combination of fast editing and quick-growing-and-shrinking props makes it hard to follow the action.|Rotten
The [film] does not detract from the original, although it is obvious that the humor has been amplified for the sequel. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A passably entertaining film with no answers to its biggest questions.|Rotten
Ant-Man and the Wasp is an eager puppy of a $100 million superhero tentpole, and it knows precisely where on your face to lick you.|Fresh
An enjoyable bit of escapist entertainment that should appease both critics and regular moviegoers alike. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Would be okay and maybe even fun were it not for the frequent presence of a gruesome ghost haunting the proceedings: a woman in constant physical and emotional agony who is trying desperately not to die. A weirdly disturbing fly in the amiable ointment.|Rotten
Director Peyton Reed has a light touch, which works well with Rudd's patented off-kilter comedic delivery.|Fresh
A welcome respite from the endless gush of showier Marvel super-product.|Fresh
The movie is akin to the last days of school after finals, when everyone is goofing around and having fun.|Fresh
"Paul Rudd is neither an aunt nor a WASP but he's fantastic in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp."""|Fresh
Perfectly disposable pop culture.|Fresh
"Like its 2015 predecessor (which also followed on the heels of a gargantuan ""Avengers"" movie), this is a funnier, gentler, and, appropriately enough, smaller Marvel movie."|Fresh
"This ""Ant-Man"" entry stakes out its own corner of the Marvel Universe sandbox as a throwback to '80s-style childlike adventure."|Fresh
"Aside from a few flourishes of aesthetic inventiveness and a single moment of genuine wonder, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" doesn't do very much with its premise."|Rotten
It's worth noting that while Ant-Man's listed first, this sequel is really all about the sting of the Wasp.|Fresh
Ant-Man & The Wasp is funny and fun but a little too wrapped up and tripped up by its quantum entanglement of plots to be truly great.|Fresh
Breezy Ant-Man and the Wasp great fun.|Fresh
"In a cinematic world crowded with comic-book flicks, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" stands out. And that's no small accomplishment."|Fresh
Underwhelming|Rotten
Even so, the sharpness in the dialogue, the sympathy Paul Rudd always exudes, and, again, his sensible perception of being a minor product, make Ant-man and the Wasp a more acceptable ephemeral pleasure. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Rudd's easy charm and sly comic energy make a billion-dollar property feel like a slacker comedy made by some friends in their loft, with everyone in the cast getting at least one good moment.|Fresh
Even when things get ultra-corny, Ant-Man and the Wasp keeps merrily buzzing along.|Fresh
It's as throwaway and silly as it sounds, and a welcome relief from the sombre air of other recent Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.|Fresh
[Ant-Man] gets by on his propensity for knockabout humour, his child-like enthusiasms and the company he keeps. He's likeable, his films are kid-friendly, and that's about it.|Fresh
Mildly entertaining, breezy and funny despite its overstuffed, convoluted and unremarkable plot and lengthy running time.|Fresh
[I]ts plot and its comedy feel like separate entities vying for control, while the characters vie for movie's focus and heart.|Rotten
Half the living beings in the universe aren't at stake, just two lives. If you're ok with that after Infinity War, then this is the perfect superhero summer blockbuster palate cleanser.|Fresh
Director Peyton Reed reassembles almost everyone from the original film and returns to build on the surprising magic that the unlikely team managed to pull off the first time around.|Fresh
It is a nice change to have a light, breezy Marvel flick that's more like a heist than a save-the-world superhero film.|Fresh
It's nice to see a Marvel movie that seems intended to amuse us more than it's designed to beat us into submission.|Fresh
We already know that superhero movies have to be loved as they are. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The most enjoyable aspects of the movie are the special effects as people, cars, buildings - and even a Hello Kitty Pez dispenser - shrink or grow in size, as the plot dictates.|Fresh
The tight-knit ensemble delivers a fun, small-scale caper that's delightfully self-contained.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp follows through on that stuff and goes even further with scale-shifting action sequences. More importantly, this film uses Rudd exponentially better, giving him plenty of opportunities to be goofy and charming and Paul Rudd-y.|Fresh
It's a refreshingly loose and daffy approach to the genre that Marvel seem to have a lock on.|Fresh
"Ant-Man and the Wasp proves to be a fun romp, but not one that's completely compelling to blockbuster fans at the level of the ""Avengers"" movies."|Fresh
All in all, Ant-Man and the Wasp amounts to a tidy, tight and consistently entertaining package. Unwrap without any reservations and simply enjoy.|Fresh
If it weren't for a smattering of PG-13 language, Ant-Man and the Wasp would be the perfect superheroes to save the whole family from the summer heat for a couple of hours.|Fresh
In a world where superhero are everywhere, you have to play up the thing that makes your superhero movie unique. The Ant-Man movies play that unique quality up well.|Fresh
Ant-Man's new adventure is entertaining and far more ambitious on a visual level and extremely fun. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Retaining all of the humor and charm of 2015's 'Ant-Man', this marvelously delightful and energetic sequel never takes itself too seriously.|Fresh
Unquestionably the most light-hearted franchise from the House of Marvel, that quality is in full swing in this consistently laugh-out-loud funny sci-fi adventure.|Fresh
While not a franchise game-changer, there's something soothing about the lower stakes of this sequel's well-honed heist plot, making it a fun follow-up.|Fresh
Thankfully, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man is as engaging as ever. He almost single-handedly saves this sequel, which is genial enough but not nearly as much fun as the original.|Fresh
The film cuts superheroes and their oh-so-serious issues down to size.|Fresh
There is cuteness and chuckle-worthy visual and verbal jokes, but the film-maker weaves in that element that eludes others: heartfelt emotion.|Fresh
Rudd remains the heart and soul by stepping back and letting everyone else fill the room. He's one of the great modern straight men, but when he lets rip... it's a quick-witted back-and-forth that's easily as funny as a drumming ant.|Fresh
No matter your size or your grasp of science or superheroes, Ant-Man and the Wasp is pure quantum fun.|Fresh
"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is disposable pop trash, not worth taking seriously for a moment and therefore eminently worthy of your attention at this moment."|Fresh
A high-spirited lark of blessedly little consequence.|Fresh
Plodding, repetitive, replete with technobabble nonsense and lifeless action, this is easily the worst-written of any of the 20 MCU offerings and may be the worst all-around film featuring a Marvel superhero since Sony rebooted Spider-Man.|Rotten
Though Rudd and Peña work like mad to get laughs, they come up well short of optimal levels achieved in Thor: Ragnarok.|Rotten
It keeps things small-scale and low-key, and for the most part turns out better for it.|Fresh
...the most fun you're likely to have at the movies this summer.|Fresh
A hugely enjoyable action offering that happily comes as one of the better efforts from Marvel's infamously erratic output.|Fresh
In general, the actors and their delivery of smart dialogue - on top of some excellent action sequences - are the main reasons to watch the film.|Fresh
It's honestly a little hard to separate Ant-Man and the Wasp's actual quality from what a lovely break it is from reality.|Fresh
Director Peyton Reed and his writers (including Rudd) have a lot of fun with scale, sizing the vehicles up and down and Scott himself getting as big as the Statue of Liberty.|Fresh
...a light movie that favours humour and family drama over action and destruction.... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[F]ast-paced, laugh-out-loud funny, and packed full of one-size-fits-all blockbuster entertainment sure to excite fans young and old. But what it has more than anything else is heart and soul...|Fresh
Director/co-writer Peyton Reed has basically made a large-scale summer comedy that just so happens to star superheroes.|Fresh
An engaging goof that resists bludgeoning you with bigness and instead settles for good vibes and jokes. Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! [Squints.] It's a surprisingly enjoyable summer romp!|Fresh
Though in every respect a lightweight addition to the Marvel canon, the innocuous 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is mildly enjoyable.|Fresh
The writing is patchy throughout and the dialogue is dreck.|Rotten
The strength in Ant-Man And The Wasp is that it's a small-stakes, personal superhero caper that's unconcerned with the bigger battle for the world's soul. It's such a relief to not be asked to invest in something grandiose.|Fresh
Over the two-hour run time it never gets dull to see objects shrink or grow in visually impressive perspective shifts and absurdly comic moments...|Fresh
In the diminutive figure's second effort, average things come in small packages.|Fresh
Actually, the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp don't tie into Avengers: Infinity War, and this creates a weird respite, reminding audiences of the entertainment derived from past Marvel features like Thor: Ragnarok and Spider-Man: Homecoming.|Fresh
"[""Ant-Man and The Wasp""] is pretty much exactly what I'd want in a superhero movie: a funny cast, zippy action scenes and not an infinity stone in sight."|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a classic Marvel superhero film but also a fresh palette cleanse to the MCU we've known for so long.|Fresh
Light and breezy, it's a worthwhile superhero sequel.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun-sized flick.|Fresh
"Here's how professor-level particle physics filters down to the general public: via ""Ant-Man."" Much more fun this way. Definitely worth the price of a movie ticket."|Fresh
[Peyton Reed] keeps it all breezy, light and laced with humor.|Fresh
As the saying goes, good things come in small packages.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp runs nearly two hours, but its merry mix of deft one-liners, visual gags, restrained action sequences and subatomic protoplasmic spectacle never drags, especially with Rudd's witty, confident performance.|Fresh
"I'm not ashamed to say that I most enjoyed ""Ant-Man"" when it felt like a sequel in spirit to ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."" ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" doubles down on that vibe and then some."|Fresh
If Ant-Man and the Wasp is hard to love, it's also hard to actively dislike.|Fresh
It's like the movie-going equivalent of a beach read.|Fresh
"Ant-Man and the Wasp is entertaining from beginning to end, especially after the apocalyptic ""Infinity War."" [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
A welcomed change of stakes and tone, coming from Infinity War. Lighthearted, fast and funny, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a solid sequel to the original. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a hilariously, fun action-flick that takes the edge off the tragic ending of Avengers: Infinity War.|Fresh
Funny, action-packed sequel is lighter Marvel fare.|Fresh
The adventure is swallowed up by exhausting attempts at humor that don't land nearly often enough.|Rotten
A good time at the movies... If the first film felt more carefully laid out, the sequel succeeds in stoking some Pixar-style emotion in its family dynamics...|Fresh
This terminally boring, by-the-numbers installment is credited to five screenwriters and all they've come up with is an inverse game of hot potato with the usual assembly of players (the good guys, the bad guys, the law and a wild card).|Rotten
It's fun, it's funny, and it's got such lower stakes than Avengers: Infinity War that it's practically the equivalent of a relaxing Sunday afternoon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.|Fresh
"We'll get back to the fight against Thanos soon enough. Enthusiasts can resume arguing over various aspects of Marvel minutiae then. For now, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is a nice break."|Fresh
There's a lot going on here, which leads to a whole lot of gassy exposition to explain it all, including two separate scenes in which two different groups of good guys are tied to chairs while villains bloviate on the intricacies of the plot.|Rotten
Turns out there is a plot device more annoying than time travel - quantum. But the make-it-up-as-we-go-along story aside, Reed still has a flair for using toys at his disposal - glitchy shrinking/growing devices, sight gags, Scott's giant ant pals, etc.|Fresh
The funniest part of Ant-Man and the Wasp is the fact Marvel followed their despairing Avengers: Infinity War cliffhanger with a disposable side-adventure. Are they having a laugh? Yes, and loving it.|Fresh
Its quiet optimism feels both welcome and badly needed.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is all in pursuit of some MCU masterplan. If only the journey there was a bit more of a buzz.|Rotten
Paul Rudd gets plenty of big (and small) laughs in Ant-Man And The Wasp, a Marvel outing thankfully on the light side, with a breakthru female character co-headlining a Marvel film for the first time.|Fresh
Bursting with dynamic special effects, skillful action, and a gentle human element that never gets displaced.|Fresh
Funny, enticing, a Marvel treasure, I loved it!|Fresh
Truly Marvel. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A light, watered-down tonic leading up to next May's Avengers 4 extravaganza.|Rotten
The earlier film's freewheeling, low-key loopiness is replaced by a dull and dutiful plot that, with its forced references to other Marvel installments, squeezes the action to fit the franchise.|Rotten
What came naturally, and perhaps accidentally, the first time out feels practiced and artificial here. The rhythm is, slightly but persistently, off.|Rotten
Ant-Man and the Wasp is so breezy and charming that what would be defects in a more self-serious film are assets here.|Fresh
I found this movie totally engaging. Rudd is absolutely charming and, as we've seen before, very funny.|Fresh
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP is solid family fun, and if you missed the first installment from 2015, it doesn't matter --- you will still enjoy the sequel. Having said that, however, the movie is a bit too long at a shade under two hours.|Fresh
"There are few, if any, surprises delivered through the course of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp."" In fact, I was bored more than once and found myself checking the time - frequently."|Rotten
Ant-Man and the Wasp may not be the best anything, but, like its perpetually challenged hero, it is plenty good enough.|Fresh
This focus on family and extended family gives Ant-Man and The Wasp a little more heart than most superhero films.|Fresh
If any word sums up Ant-Man and The Wasp it's the one you never want to hear about a sequel: Extraneous.|Rotten
As much as the jokes are funny and mostly work, it starts to get in the way of the drama, or at least the emotional heft, that they're trying to go for with what is ultimately this rescue story.|Rotten
There is more of an emotional underpinning to this one than there was in the first one because of the Michelle Pfeiffer element to it.|Fresh
Big laughs, small concerns.|Fresh
Adequate to sate the audience between the major tentpoles.|Fresh
"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is merry and fleet, and no less enjoyable for being instantly forgettable. The buzz might be temporary, but it's fun while it lasts."|Fresh
"Showcasing Marvel's funny, family-friendly side, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is just fine. And given the heavy narrative that played out in ""Infinity War,"" it's a tiny reprieve from all the death and destruction."|Fresh
It's a movie that understands all the variances of scale, and takes the audience along for the ride as they constantly change.|Fresh
This is a wonderful toy that one imagines young girls in particular would like - and it's hard to believe that there will be anything funnier this summer.|Fresh
It's a dazzling, fast-paced, outrageously funny superhero romp that feels more cohesive than its 2015 predecessor, Ant-Man...|Fresh
It comes close to greatness but stops a little short. And that's not a big deal.|Fresh
Instantly forgettable and habitually unfunny.|Rotten
Scruffy, understated and fun, the sequel sidesteps just about all of the gravitas left hanging after the events of April's highly-anticipated superhero crossover.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a nice lighthearted breather from recent devastating MCU events; this isn't the first time Ant-Man has had a tough act to follow, and judging from this sequel, it won't be the last, as the successful levity is welcome|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is undoubtedly a laugh-out-loud blockbuster superhero movie that will entertain audiences and provide a much-needed break to all the drama happening elsewhere in the Marvel Universe after Avengers: Infinity War.|Fresh
Not everything has to be serious and epic, sometimes having fun is just what we need.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is delightful from start to finish, especially after the apocalyptic Infinity War.|Fresh
A sequel... is automatically more interesting because it is building off the history of another movie. This proves true with Ant-Man and The Wasp, but not because it's the sequel to Ant-Man, rather because it's the sequel to Captain America: Civil War.|Fresh
Occasionally agreeable but ultimately disposable, [it's] a bauble that feels less like a fun side journey and more like a waste of everybody's time.|Rotten
The movie takes nothing, including itself, seriously, and just runs on as a nice caper with relatively low stakes and goofball humor.|Fresh
The payoffs aren't plot points but the gags, which somehow defuse the tension without turning the picture into camp.|Fresh
"""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" the first sequel to 2015's ""Ant-Man,"" is barely an exoskeleton next to its much better predecessor."|Rotten
Ant-Man and the Wasp brings humor and levity back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's loaded with incredible action scenes, really amping up the visual effects from the first film.|Fresh
Inconsequential, but damn, is it fun.|Fresh
No sting here: this one's a big, happy hit.|Fresh
Almost as enjoyable as the first. Not quite the same impact, but a good ride from start to finish.|Fresh
I loved the action, I loved a lot of the humor, but it wasn't as good as the first one in my opinion...|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp works well enough.|Fresh
What the film does best, though, is entertain us with a kinetic romp through the Marvel Cinematic Universe without being held down by it.|Fresh
Ant-Man & The Wasp is a triumph not because it sees its heroes saving us all from oblivion, but because they desire the same comfort their audience does when they're possibly doomed to the void: a gentle embrace from those closest to them.|Fresh
Delivers giant sized laughs, fun thrills and is all together a perfectly timed chapter of Phase 3 to loosen the mood up for MCU fans.|Fresh
A blast of pure popcorn fun, and something of a palate cleanser after the weightier likes of Black Panther and Infinity War.|Fresh
It's disjointed, and cluttered, but it's also entertaining in spurts. Is that enough? Just about, and not quite.|Rotten
This is one of those Marvel products peddling self-aware detachment as a defining narrative strategy...It feels less like a feature film than a meme somebody made about an Ant-Man trailer.|Rotten
"The basic necessities of narrative momentum are given the requisite focus and care that in better properties can produce exceptional Marvel entertainments... but in the case of Ant-Man, words like ""basic"" and ""requisite"" are always the ceiling."|Rotten
While Ant-Man and The Wasp is a bit lighter than the average Marvel film... the comedy is subtle and fits in well with the storyline.|Fresh
The script is snappy, and the jokes keep coming, making Ant-Man and the Wasp a healing balm after the dark ending of May's Avengers: Infinity War.|Fresh
Ant-Man And The Wasp is arguably even more of a straightforward comedy, to the point that it doesn't even have a primary villain.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a crowd-pleaser of a film, and a reminder that great characters and fun scripts are what make enjoyable comic book movies-not just a huge shared universe.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a two-hour mental break when a lot of people could need a mental break.... I mean this as a huge compliment.|Fresh
There's no getting away from the fact that Ant-Man And The Wasp, as fun as it is, lacks the sheer, mind-blowing heft of Infinity War... In this new era of Marvel over-achievement, it really does feel like a lesser work.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a hilarious return to the shrinking heroes, but with elevated action and a heartfelt story, it's a well-rounded Marvel sequel.|Fresh
"With its constant humor and the energetic chemistry between Rudd and Lilly, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is the most playful of the Marvel movies"|Fresh
The thrill of the film is watching Ant-Man and the Wasp team up and raise hell together.|Fresh
You might wish the whole movie had found a way to go quantum; you'll certainly long for more Pfeiffer, who has too few scenes but invests each of them with her usual luminosity.|Fresh
"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" has its moments, but it doesn't quite measure up to the original."|Rotten
Ant-Man and The Wasp brings some much-needed comedy to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.|Fresh
This is a very funny movie that I laughed out loud to more times than I can count.|Fresh
Ant-Man and The Wasp is a great breather that was sorely needed after Infinity War. It makes me appreciate Avengers more while allowing me to breath, kick up my feet, and just have fun for two hours.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is an airy, nimble piece of filmmaking: Reed's confidence to unapologetically embrace weirdness gives the franchise its distinctly playful spirit.|Fresh
"It's a lively, funny and unapologetically fantastical change-of-pace from the last few ""gotta save the world"" MCU epics."|Fresh
Its comedy is wonderfully offbeat, its heart is huge and emblazoned on its sleeve, and its intentions are wildly optimistic and bright.|Fresh
"Improving on the lackluster 2015 original, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is winningly modest, no small feat for a film which is part of the gargantuan Marvel Cinematic Universe."|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp never forgets that it's a part of one of the comedic pillars of the MCU, and it keeps the jokes flying fast and free.|Fresh
Rudd is such a friendly, likable presence; he sets this movie's pace, while Lilly's fiercely committed Hope/Wasp acts as the perfect counterweight. Rudd's scenes with Lilly and with Fortson make the movie matter in human terms.|Fresh
Ant-Man And The Wasp surpasses the original by miles, functioning best when it embraces its sheer absurdity and loopy lunacy.|Fresh
It seems pretty nice. Would that we could wrestle the rest of the world down to that same agreeable scale.|Fresh
"While Ant-Man's technically ""the star,"" this is most definitely the Wasp's movie to own, and the smirking, enjoyably no-nonsense role fits Lilly well."|Fresh
Isn't the funniest Marvel movie ever made, or the deepest or the coolest or the most creative. But it just might be the nicest, and that counts for something.|Fresh
"The essence of ""Ant-Man"" is inherently silly, and that's where the strength of the new movie lies."|Fresh
The rest of the Marvel family could learn a thing or two from the scrappy small-scale of their tiniest colleague.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is a comparatively modest film that puts a premium on fun.|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp is the funniest movie Marvel has made yet.|Fresh
The good news is, Ant-Man and the Wasp is better than the first film.|Fresh
After a rough start in the previous entry, director Peyton Reed seems much more comfortable balancing wacky antics, familial bonds and over-the-top superhero set pieces this time around.|Fresh
Ant-Man and The Wasp is bolder, funnier, and far more daring than the film that preceded it, but also slightly less even and narratively tight.|Fresh
Ant-Man and The Wasp isn't an essential Marvel movie, but it's further proof that good things come in small packages.|Fresh
This latest entry in the unstoppable Marvel Studios takeover of the world is probably the most amusing film the company has made since the Kevin Feige reign began a decade ago.|Fresh
"Like the first movie, director Peyton Reed (""Bring It On"") mixes action and laughs to deliver one of the most enjoyable moviegoing experiences you'll have this summer."|Fresh
Ant-Man and the Wasp has a pleasingly breakneck, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't surreal glee. It's a cunningly swift and delightful comedy of scale.|Fresh
Même sans l'effet de surprise, cette suite s'avère très réjouissante. [Full review in French]|Fresh
"Stories come in all shapes and sizes and ""Ant-Man And The Wasp"" proves not all their superhero movies need to be blockbusters about saving the world."|Fresh
Ebulliently funny, visually inventive, and above all passionately committed to the idea that heroism isn't a burden but an uplifting realization of our best qualities.|Fresh
A small step up from the first Ant-Man.|Fresh
Ant-Man And The Wasp is the kind of playtime entertainment suited for Scott Lang's better-when-on-a-team personality, loaded with size-shifty sight gags and lower stakes worth Paul Rudd's ensemble stardom.|Fresh
