Command and Control is one heck of a deadly doomsday scenario.|Fresh
Robert Kenner's compelling and tense documentary Command and Control... looks at the danger arguably more basic and constant than that of nuclear war in the mere deployment of nuclear weapons in supposedly safe stateside locations.|Fresh
"Command and Control is a gripping account of what happens when things don't ""work perfect"" at a nuclear-weapons site."|Fresh
The film uses a minute-by-minute account to the Damascus incident as the backbone of a story about what can happen when human beings are expected to perform even simple tasks perfectly 100 percent of the time.|Fresh
A suitable subject for a nail-biter fictional thriller, but it's a documentary.|Fresh
Sleep well, America!|Fresh
Morbid, apocalyptic yet enthralling.|Fresh
The statistical probability of a nuclear accident increases every moment. Humankind has been lucky so far, which Command and Control makes poignantly clear.|Fresh
"""Command and Control"" may not be overwhelming work, but as a critical reminder of the fallibility of men around doomsday devices, it's terrifying."|Fresh

"""Command and Control"" may not be overwhelming work, but as a critical reminder of the fallibility of men around doomsday devices, it's terrifying."|Fresh
The meat of Kenner's story is the heroics of the Air Force technicians who risked their lives. It adds a personal touch that immensely humanizes a story that could easily get lost in the minutia.|Fresh
Kenner and Schlosser not only remind us of a danger that never went away, but honor the men whose bravery was never recognized.|Fresh
In case it has slipped your mind, Robert Kenner's doc is here to remind us that nuclear technology inspired the very acme of human scientific stupidity and arrogance.|Fresh
"""Command and Control"" has a strong anti-nuclear bomb vibe as it shows the confusion of those responsible for taking care of our nuclear arsenal."|Fresh
A terrifying dossier of denial and neglect.|Fresh
"Far from being a historical cautionary tale, ""Command and Control"" looks forward, not backward. Kenner's unsettling film casts its worried gaze not at the accidents that already have taken place, but at the ones yet to happen."|Fresh
As Schlosser and Kenner explain, it's just dumb luck that some distracted technician hasn't accidentally triggered one of these things -- and if that doesn't keep you up at night, it damn well should.|Fresh
Despite the high stakes, Command and Control is morbidly fun to watch, in the manner of good suspense thrillers and disaster films.|Fresh
What gives Command and Control its urgency are both its wealth of information and the implications of its story.|Fresh
Archival footage is combined with somewhat affected-looking re-enactments, but the film achieves its purpose: to remind us that we still have thousands of bombs, and neither they - nor we - have gotten that much smarter.|Fresh
The pace of the drama is riveting, as it jumps back through the decades to place the accident in the context of the nuclear arms race.|Fresh
As white-knuckle suspenseful as any movie you are likely to see this year.|Fresh
Since 1980, our weaponry has grown far more sophisticated; whether the sophistication of its handlers has grown as well is something you'll be pondering after the ending credits roll.|Fresh
A close call with a gargantuan catastrophe and a risk that still exists as long as nuclear weapons exist.|Fresh
A crisp, horrifying, investigative documentary about the nuclear missile silo disaster that nearly annihilated much of Arkansas in 1980.|Fresh
Robert Kenner's stylistic choices amplify the film's fetishistic fascination with the nuclear weaponry itself.|Rotten
Kenner creates a brisk, efficient exploration of a troubling moment in our history, with questions that are very much of this moment.|Fresh
A deftly constructed non-fiction thriller, Command and Control has all the tension and drama of a fiction film, and all the historical attention to detail of the best documentaries.|Fresh
Chilling and prodigiously researched ...|Fresh
Equal parts history lesson, cautionary tale and nerve-rattling thriller, using all manner of nonfiction devices to elicit both horror and outrage over the precariousness of our deadliest arsenals.|Fresh
