Blindspotting is a near faultless film - bravely engaging with topical issues while providing a frank, often funny, look at those caught in the mess.|Fresh
This is a powerful, well-acted film with memorable characters. Director Carlos López Estrada makes good use of imagery, poetry, drama and humor to illustrate what it is like to live as a troubled black man in a racially divided city.|Fresh
Has the high-energy crackle and syncopated rhythms of a rap battle, with its buddy comedy format sharing the stage and trading rhymes and times with its deeper societal commentary element to nimble effect.|Fresh
A timely film about the state of America.|Fresh
A straightforward fusion between 8 Mile and Fruitvale Station.|Fresh
It's been a good year for films like this... and this one is at the top.|Fresh
If you're putting BlacKKKlansman on your list as one of the best movies of the year... then you need to watch this movie. And this needs to go on your list.|Fresh
The film has social commentary but it doesn't distract from the narrative making it a quite mesmerizing portrayal of racial conflict and how even the most toxic people get free passes depending on their race|Fresh
Both an incredibly funny comedy and a poignant drama on the themes of identity, perception and society.|Fresh
In the form of a delirious bromance, where the digressions are numerous, [director Carlos López Estrada] never loses the thread of his plot, until an apotheosis of final sequences. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Things always look different depending on your perspective and by challenging all kinds of stereotypes, the film becomes an even more provocative work of art.|Fresh
Don't miss this sleeper pick.|Fresh
Funnier than I expected. More ambitious than I expected. A lot deeper than I expected. BLINDSPOTTING refuses to narrow its scope and is messier and stronger for it.|Fresh
[Carlos López Estrada] punctuates Blindspotting with the well-timed syncopations of an impassioned rap performance, finding grooves in which to place the collective anger and hurt of a race and let it spark.|Fresh
Blindspotting should be in the awards conversation this year, but even if it isn't, it will remain a testament to the power of cinema to depict, and criticize, contemporary life in America.|Fresh
Gripping, authentic, tense, uproarious and strong, Blindspotting is a superb achievement.|Fresh
Blindspotting is a triumph of a film that mixes insightful social commentary with a buddy comedy and is also not afraid to dip into more serious material from time to time.|Fresh
With the vibrancy and kineticism similar to the recent Dope, but a simmering righteous anger evoking a young Spike Lee, Blindspotting... is primed to unleash hell on the American public when it drops in theaters.|Fresh
When watching Blindspotting, it's hard to tell that it is the first major film from co-writers/co-stars Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal and the feature directorial debut for director Carlos Lopez Estrada - because it's just that good.|Fresh
Not only did the acting impress me, but the story and themes present throughout were incredibly relevant.|Fresh
The story explodes on screen and it is hard not to feel its effects.|Fresh
The combination of the rhythmic script, the bumping soundtrack, and the stylish direction recall the early work of Spike Lee.|Fresh
Energetic but wildly uneven.|Rotten
Tackles serious issues with style, but feels uneven.|Fresh
The performances coming from Diggs and Casal are simply a level above any other I've seen this year.|Fresh
One fruit of all that go-getting energy is a fast, rhythmical narrative style, enhanced by a bit of humour; another is the passion and freshness that characterise the social commentary.|Fresh
What could have been laboured and polemical is deftly handled, defused with comedy and powered by a pulsating score.|Fresh
By equal turns tense and witty but with plenty of perceptive social commentary to go around, this is a film that only gets more rewarding the more you look under its surface.|Fresh
Reportedly 10 years in the making, Blindspotting is a refreshingly original, gritty and stylised version of the typical rites-of-passage story.|Fresh
There's an appealing originality and energy to Blindspotting, thanks mostly to the strong performances of its leads, Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal, who also wrote the screenplay.|Fresh
It's acted with naturalistic brio and the script, by Diggs and Casal, is full of pungent dialogue and nuanced reflections on Collin's struggle to avoid becoming a stereotypically angry young black man.|Fresh
Try and take your electrified eyes off it. It's practically 2018: The Movie.|Fresh
The film's spell grows and grows, perhaps because we're not sure exactly what the writers and first-time director Carlos López Estrada are preaching or promoting.|Fresh
There's a Clerks-esque vibe to the feckless, laidback bants, yet the zesty multiculturalism and feel for the local scene ensure Blindspotting is amply idiosyncratic and of our time.|Fresh
"America's ever-festering boil of racism continues to claim the lives of minorities and those unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when guns are drawn. ""Blindspotting"" plays it safe; who can blame it for that?"|Rotten
Excitingly watchable, brashly cinematic, full of ideas, and full of the idealism of the very best American indie cinema.|Fresh
The result is a powerful film that the viewer will carry with them long after the credits roll, and a staunch reminder of how much conscious work we must all do to overcome the implicit bias of our surroundings.|Fresh
The acting was extremely strong. I feel it had some really good messages, though some they could have driven home in a different way.|Fresh
I really liked this. The third act is a little wonky...but it's also an hour-and-a-half, very tight, and something new.|Fresh
Blindspotting is teaching us real world lessons that subtlety will only confuse. Some gray still remains, but not enough to muddy its message's necessary intent.|Fresh
Blindspotting is the freshest commentary on race relations since Black Lives Matter, and in a film sense, since Do the Right Thing.|Fresh
For the most part an insightful urban indie dramedy that intelligently reflects on violence and race issues, using comedy and rap music to its advantage.|Fresh
I love the relevance of the subject matter. They don't beat you over the head with it and make it all serious and preachy. But at the same time, they get the message across. They let you know...the paranoia that African-American men are feeling.|Fresh
A boldly spitfire, outspoken film of the summer you don't want to miss.|Fresh
"To add insult to injury, ""Blindspotting,"" a portrait of Oakland that's too enamored of itself, ends in lazy buddy-movie fashion. It appears to let its protagonists off the hook, and reduces the roiling storm it its core to a passing shower."|Rotten
Rafael Casal And Daveed Diggs' Love Letter To Oakland|Fresh
It's bold and boisterous. It's intense and remarkably charming and under Carlos Lopez Estrada's it's worth watching -- twice.|Fresh
One of my favorite movies I've seen so far this year.|Fresh
While police brutality has been occurring for years, the effects of have recently began to trickle into cinema. A truly powerful masterpiece, Blindspotting infuses loud visuals, spoken verse, and the backdrop of Oakland to relay its message.|Fresh
Both actors turn in virtuoso performances as friends confronting issues of race, class, identity, and their own volatile, longtime friendship.|Fresh
Has some sharp and sometimes incendiary political points to make, but does so in a way that isn't smug or preachy. A major work.|Fresh
Blindspotting is a film audiences will be deconstructing for years to come. It's a film that wears its contemporary bent on its sleeve while simultaneously bemoaning how being contemporary has robbed the city of Oakland of its diversity.|Fresh
The title is indicative of the film's goal; to show us our cultural blind spots by placing us in the shoes of another. In that way, Blindspotting, the film, is an artistic triumph perfectly suited to its cultural moment.|Fresh
The film offers a representation that wouldn't necessarily be represented on screen, but it's a story worth telling and does it more so as a buddy comedy amid such a serious subject of race and class.|Fresh
Ultimately, Blindspotting is a far more powerful film that leaves a deep impact on the viewer, and it doesn't take costly Hamilton tickets to realize that Diggs is incredibly talented and should continue making films.|Fresh
This is a story that is fresh, funny and vital, the electrifying observational meditations at its center overflowing with a satirical edge that's frequently thrilling. I loved this movie. Full stop.|Fresh
Diggs and Casal have a defined vision for characters and tension, supplying a meaningful primal scream in the middle of a world gone mad.|Fresh
"The duo's way with words in those endeavors lend ""Blindspotting"" a vibrant sense of language that gives voice to what it is like to be young and a minority in a rapidly changing society."|Fresh
The stars, Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal, engineer their roles toward complexity, never settling for the simple.|Fresh
A star is born. Ok, TWO stars.|Fresh
A little messy, but more often than not Blindspotting is a bold, freewheeling examination of race in class in gentrifying America.|Fresh
The ideas are big and the creativity invigorating, with stories of transformation that are specific to Oakland yet universally resonant.|Fresh
This is a devastatingly surefooted debut by music video director Carlos López Estrada, who injects this drama about class and race issues with the nervous, bopping energy of Spike Lee's early films.|Fresh
Diggs' charisma goes a long way toward drawing the audience in. We're rooting for him to succeed. And yeah, his dopey friend, too.|Fresh
Oakland set social satire takes insightful look at race and gentrification.|Fresh
"A sense of impending doom about ""Blindspotting,"" a unique, stylish and definitely R-rated drama from a pair of longtime friends that works in dramatic tone changes, guiding the audience towards a provocative finish."|Fresh
Blindspotting effectively balances buddy comedy with astute social commentary, providing fun and gut-wrenching anger and despair in equal measure.|Fresh
So many of the films released in the U.S. are just minor spins on films that have already been made, so it's always worth noting when something original comes along. Blindspotting certainly meets that standard.|Fresh
This snappy look at the divide between race and class in the Bay Area is fresh and exciting despite being messy and overly ambitious.|Fresh
It's wildly entertaining, and in a moment where Black Lives Matter has been occasionally overcooked in pop culture, the movie still feels timely and extremely relevant.|Fresh
Part of an exciting new wave of movies addressing America's racial divide (see: Sorry to Bother You), these guys take huge risks.|Fresh
It's in this tension of hyper-reality that Blindspotting lives, saying as much as they can as fast as they can... showing you, per the title, that what you see in front of you is not always all that is there.|Fresh
From the mean streets of Oakland, Calif., comes a story about friendship, race and class that's a veritable revelation suffused with authenticity and wisdom.|Fresh
This is a movie that should be seen. You will think about it for a long time, wrestling with the questions it asks and doesn't always answer, at least not in a traditional way.|Fresh
There's a lot to love about this vivid, rhythmic, 'Do The Right Thing' for contemporary Oakland, though it does feel slightly incomplete.|Fresh
Funny, vibrant, insightful, tragic, achingly timely, and yet with an underlying message about empathy that is timeless, Blindspotting may be the summer's most essential movie.|Fresh
The film is sprinkled with the type of small moments and details that elevate, a trenchant tee shirt here, an old wedding photo there, a faulty house alarm signaling impending danger.|Fresh
[A] feeling of spontaneity and the admirable nuance... defines most of the movie.|Fresh
Blindspotting -- the unusual term will be defined by Collin's ex-girlfriend Val, given sympathetic portrayal by Janina Gavankar -- is one of a number of films this summer that put a sharp focus on the black experience in America.|Fresh
Gentrification, police brutality and the prison industrial complex are just some of the many, many talking points Blindspotting grapples with in ways that are intimate, insightful and wildly entertaining - but also frequently frustrating.|Fresh
It's as fresh and alive as any big city, a movie you don't just watch but breathe in.|Fresh
The film's empathetic lens instills the feeling that the places on screen may already be gone by now, turning Blindspotting into a kind of documentary of the area that also shares its story: one of survival in the face of trauma.|Fresh
Blindspotting's searing exploration of hot-button issues as race, class and police brutality in such confrontational fashion makes for a thought-provoking experience guaranteed to affect you long after leaving the theater.|Fresh
"""Blindspotting"" is filled with passionate intentions, but debuting director Carlos López Estrada doesn't know much about restraint."|Rotten
A contemporary fable told in dynamic syncopation and unexpected compassion as it uncovers the farce and tragedy of an Oakland in transition.|Fresh
This indie dramedy could have been a hard-knock urban story, but instead it's funny and insightful, with heartfelt characters, as well as astute enough to explore many sides of the issues at hand.|Fresh
Even if the execution is somewhat messy, this ambitious and thoughtful effort is a real eye-opener.|Fresh
A cathartic battle cry against police brutality and gentrification, and a sensitive, nuanced unpacking of race and identity|Fresh
'Blindspotting' has enough verve, humor, and passion to recommend it-even as it overplays its hand in its final minutes.|Fresh
Ambitious , starkly original Dramedy is a showcase for the unique talents of Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal.|Fresh
Blindspotting is raw, passionate and honest in its examination of... how things can look completely different depending on a person's perspective.|Fresh
As the plot unfolds to lead us to this breaking point, it challenges its audience to overcome long-ingrained stereotypes that a black man is automatically a menacing figure.|Fresh
Blindspotting is a film about gentrification that never stops screwing with its audience.|Fresh
Blindspotting moves at a brisk pace and raises the dramatic stakes with each scene; director Estrada has a masterful touch for pacing.|Fresh
Movies about race in America are seldom in short supply, but rarely do they venture past the realm of personal prejudice into the more complicated terrain of economic racism.|Fresh
Like all great movies, Blindspotting is a force to be reckoned with and wrestled with. No matter where you land in your assessment, your expectations are guaranteed to be shattered.|Fresh
There's a genuine sense of camaraderie and affection between these two characters that cannot be faked...|Fresh
Exceptional performances a gripping story, and a nuanced, sometimes poetic portrayal of issues of race, class, and friendship.|Fresh
Still, it's hard to remember a recent movie that so powerfully distilled social issues into a single relationship.|Fresh
That it feels as authentic and well-honed as it does is a testament to its creative talent's innate familiarity and love for this city, and deeper understanding of the degree to which the Oakland experience is the American one.|Fresh
Co-stars and co-writers Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal have a lot to say, much of it funny and/or provocative, but neither they nor first-time feature director Carlos López Estrada can figure out a way to shape all this material into a cohesive film.|Rotten
A timely meditation on what it means to be black and presumed guilty in America.|Fresh
Collin and Miles's relationship also allows the movie to carefully but confidently address some of the thornier realities that abstracted political and social arguments often sidestep for convenience's sake.|Fresh
It's so incredibly tense and everything that did feel messy and scattered all of a sudden comes together in a way that does feel cohesive, and does feel focused, and does feel powerful in a way that perhaps it had not previously.|Fresh
The film's break-out performance belongs to Cascal. Miles' emotions carry an electric charge that he can't control, and he pairs them with high-voltage turns of phrase.|Fresh
Estrada has made a vibrant film, one popping with ideas and ideals as it presents a vivid and complicated Oakland.|Fresh
A funny and relevant new Oakland-set buddy dramedy opening today about two friends, one white, one black.|Fresh
Two Oakland homies, 'Hamilton' star Daveed Diggs and poet Rafael Casal, create an intensely personal story about life on the edge in a rapidly changing city. Even when the plot fires off in too many directions, Diggs and Casal will keep you riveted.|Fresh
Blindspotting is entertaining, but it also packs an emotional punch.|Fresh
An explosive racial comedy ... saved by the sheer magnetism of Daveed Diggs' personality and the righteous anger of his character.|Fresh
The film takes aim at myriad targets and bluntly satirizing them in disparate styles that never mesh into a cohesive whole.|Rotten
"I unabashedly admire the movie's aims, and think ""Blindspotting"" ought to be seen by the widest audience possible."|Fresh
Superb and daring ... a thrilling, riotous, language-drunk elegy and celebration for this most unfixed of cities.|Fresh
Casal and Diggs have both lived these roles for years, so it's not surprising that they never deliver a false moment.|Fresh
An exuberant, brightly colored, zigzagging portrait of a city, an uneasy transformation and a friendship.|Fresh
Despite its flaws, Blindspotting is a bold, brave, and important film that should be seen and discussed. While it is a far cry from perfect, I do believe that the topics brought up within this story are meaningful and relevant to today.|Fresh
Audiences looking for a film that expresses all the vitality - and everyday struggle - of life in contemporary Oakland, search no more. Blindspotting, one of the most important movies of the year, is the one.|Fresh
A spirited, thoughtful, thoroughly entertaining valentine to a city and its still-unfolding history, and a bracing reminder that two things can be true at the same time.|Fresh
Real-life friends Diggs and Casal must have less of an unstable dynamic than their characters; the two actors wrote Blindspotting together and perform a potentially fraught duet as its leads.|Fresh
"""Blindspotting"" will go down as one of the good things by which 2018 will be remembered. It's a serious work of passion, intuition and artistic intelligence."|Fresh
In these trying times of urban change, police malfeasance, gun violence, racial strife and such, it's nice that Diggs, Casal and Blindspotting are sending a message from the front lines that confirms what you're experiencing and gives you a grain of hope.|Fresh
The conflicts are schematic, the characters are thinly sketched, and Diggs displays his hip-hop artistry as if stepping upstage.|Rotten
There are more incredibly defined layers to the characters and thematic takeaways in Blindspotting than the human mind can process in a single viewing|Fresh
A candid, and occasionally humorous, look at the systematic oppression of the disenfranchised residents of Oakland, CA.|Fresh
There aren't enough superlatives I can throw at this film. It's funny and tense, honest and insightful, and painfully prescient. At the end of the day, this movie awed me.|Fresh
More than a treatise or answer key, it's a palpable blast of frustration and rage that shakes you - and should vault Diggs to the top of every casting agent's list.|Fresh
Painful to watch, at times, it is also very, very funny and a work of gloriously intelligent cinema.|Fresh
Blindspotting is a force to be reckoned with in terms of experience, anger and boiled frustrations that beg anyone watching to lead the charge for change.|Fresh
"At its core, Estrada's picture is a buddy comedy, observing as two goofballs find ways to amuse themselves in a hometown that may no longer feel like ""home""."|Fresh
Diggs on screen is intense. He is a movie star.|Fresh
Clumsy though it may be, Blindspotting is a ride worth taking.|Fresh
Blindspotting succeeds in the smaller moments more so than with the bigger picture.|Fresh
We enjoy spending time with these characters, but the script needs to be leaner and less self-indulgent. When things finally click into gear, however, Blindspotting is relentless.|Fresh
Its dialogue is what's most brilliant about Blindspotting. Casal and Diggs use raps and rhymes interspersed with traditional discourse. It's not a straightforward story about present-day race relations, toxic masculinity, and immaturity by any means.|Fresh
Diggs is a force of a nature, dropping verbal dimes in monologues that are the backbone of the entire story.|Fresh
There's something special about Blindspotting.|Fresh
A comedy-drama so caught up in its teachable moments that it often fails to come off like either.|Rotten
Blindspotting feels like a phenomenon, a film that's sure to not only engage with present audiences but for generations to come.|Fresh
The film's messy mix of flavorful, sometimes over-the-top character comedy and sincere racial politics benefits from the voice of its stars, who also wrote the script ...|Fresh
A raw, abrasive call for an adjustment in the way we see each other.|Fresh
Still, Blindspotting, which was the heralded opening-night film at the festival, has an undeniable presence.|Fresh
Penned by Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal, Blindspotting is a treasure and a love letter to Oakland|Fresh
Yes, you'll likely leave the theater blown away by Casal and Diggs' considerable talent, but its Estrada's vision that will haunt you.|Fresh
Blindspotting doesn't have all the answers, and it doesn't even really attempt to give them, but it does provide a road to understanding through empathy.|Fresh
But as led by Daveed Diggs' impassioned, tormented performance, Blindspotting is hard to shake, despite its on-the-nose plot points and melodramatic flourishes.|Fresh
And just like that, Carlos López Estrada is a filmmaker to watch.|Fresh
The ultimate success of Blindspotting comes down to the intensity of emotion percolating beneath each scene, with Diggs' face exuding fury for an unjust world that has no use for his goodwill.|Fresh
The mix of comedy and drama occasionally falls a little flat, with the drama often working better than the comedy, as do the occasional doses of surrealism via director Carlos Lopez Estrada.|Fresh
Blindspotting is well worth your time, and it is undeniable proof that Daveed Diggs is our next great movie star.|Fresh
Estrada's debut feature brandishes a brash exuberance and stilted storytelling tropes in roughly equal measure, yielding a final result that stimulates just as it cheapens itself dramatically.|Rotten
"""Blindspotting"" encourages audiences to look beyond surface prejudices and really see their fellow citizens for the first time. If ever there was a film to open America's eyes, this is it."|Fresh
