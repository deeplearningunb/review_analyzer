Director Debra Granik does an amazing job.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is the perfect antidote for those wanting something other than multi-million dollar blockbusters and flashy awards bait.|Fresh
A tremendously affecting film that never resorts to cheap manipulation.|Fresh
It's an emancipative, heartbreaking experience with humanity galore.|Fresh
[Director Debra Granik] presents a nuanced, thought-provoking story about life on the fringes, and along the way, discovers and nurtures another star-caliber young talent in McKenzie with Leave No Trace.|Fresh
As the father's doomed ideal collapses, the movie's conflict resolves into two competing universal impulses: the desire to be noticed and the desire to disappear.|Fresh
At bottom, Leave No Trace is about human bonds, and specifically the bond of parents and children.|Fresh
Another great character drama from Debra Granik, who continues to impress with her Midas touch on character, setting and performance.|Fresh
...the film's quiet pace and beautiful cinematography (much of it shot in the forests near Portland, Oregon) perfectly complement the story.|Fresh

Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie astonish us in this emotion train which displays a primitive conflict that nowadays must not be uncommon. [Review in Spanish]|Fresh
To call the film's lead characters isolationists seems unfair: they simply find their own human connections through privacy. Who are we to say what defines a home?|Fresh
With harmonious felicity, Foster and McKenzie trace Granik's story like a twig parting sand. She couldn't have asked for a better duo.|Fresh
America isn't broken-it's shattered. Every frame, every moment, every performance in director Debra Granik's quietly devastating and haunting survival saga tells us so.|Fresh
Like Captain Fantastic from a couple of years ago, but with much more art, grace, and a sense of actual danger, Leave No Trace restates the male Gen-X narrative of protecting children from the outside world and their eventual reintegration into it.|Fresh
Narratively, LEAVE NO TRACE falls flat, yet [Thomasin] McKenzie's performance is unlike anything that's been shown this year.|Fresh
The past decade hasn't diminished Debra Granik's formidable talent behind the camera, her deep emotional sensitivity, or her genuine fascination with a slower, forgotten kind of American life.|Fresh
The chemistry between Foster and McKenzie is brutal and together they have been the fundamental key so that Leave No Trace is one of those small films in dimensions but enormous in importance and depth. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Every single person in Leave No Trace is seen and depicted as just that: a person, a human being, a significant Other.|Fresh
Headlined by twin incredible performance from Ben Foster and Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie, this movie just makes you ache.|Fresh
Very, very good acting. I do wish some more happened, though.|Fresh
Debra Granik continues to peer into the grungy sideshow of backcountry American life.|Fresh
director Debra Granik...has created a film rooted in realistic details of wilderness life that's a sympathetic but unsentimental comment on conventional and alternative societies.|Fresh
Ben Foster has rarely been better than he is here.|Fresh
Foster and McKenzie are fantastic. The authentic performances drive this beautiful story filled with hope and heartbreak. The audience is rooting for these two in a world that can be very harsh.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is a heartfelt road picture in which the road is both the lure and the prison.|Fresh
A deeply affecting tale of love and survival|Fresh
Leave No Trace is a powerful and devastating call for help for ill veterans, a love letter to nature and familial love. Mackenzie is effortlessly lifelike in a stunning, delicate performance and Foster is as usual, stellar and dominant.|Fresh
Granik's star-making instincts are as sharp as ever.|Fresh
This is a real, beautiful, quiet movie.|Fresh
"Like ""Winter's Bone,"" ""Leave No Trace"" doesn't unfold with a typical Hollywood-type narrative. Instead of the dramatic highs and lows, it proceeds in a stately, evenly paced manner that smacks of authentic life."|Fresh
My favorite movie of the summer is the quiet masterpiece Leave No Trace, directed by Debra Granik.|Fresh
Serves as a reminder of all the amazing things American independent cinema could be if it pushed itself more.|Fresh
I loved this film.|Fresh
These are two empathetic people reconciling the fact their boundless love is no match for the widening chasm of personal urgency between them.|Fresh
Leave No Trace, in the biggest of ironies, leaves the greatest of traces upon us.|Fresh
Beautifully written and powerfully performed by the two leads, Debra Granik's Leave No Trace is a subtle moving story with complexity and heart.|Fresh
The subtle ways we witness [Tom's] epiphany, her little flickers of rebellion, are striking.|Fresh
One of the most gentle and unique films to be released so far in 2018.|Fresh
I was completely immersed in Leave No Trace. The pacing is perfect and while I tend to believe that 2 hours is too long for most films, this one never dragged.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is an absolute gem.|Fresh
With genuine performances and artistically skilled direction and cinematography, we are brought into their world, experiencing their every thought and emotion and ultimately leaving us breathless and awestruck.|Fresh
It is a testament to Granik's storytelling prowess that she sees no need to ratchet up the tension when the going gets tough for Will and Tom, and the film is stronger because of it.|Fresh
The film captures the universal dynamic between teens and their parents, but the stakes are unfamiliar. Yet, Foster and McKenzie present a level of humanity that is timelessly authentic.|Fresh
As a coming of age tale it is sparse, bittersweet and desperately powerful - change is pulling these two interwoven lives apart, made explicit by Granik's empathy and unerring eye.|Fresh
Granik only sees hope and endurance in her worn out characters. They are people struggling to decide which future makes the most sense living in a country suffering its own identity crisis. Her optimism feels as essential as the wind in the trees.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is a small film, but a quietly memorable one.|Fresh
An awesome off the grid survivalist drama.|Fresh
There are few, if any, villains in Leave No Trace. There are no definitive bad or good guys -- just real people with real-world problems trying really hard to stay out of trouble and stay alive.|Fresh
The middle of a forest in Portland is the unlikely setting for this touching story from writer director Debra Granik as it explores the bond between father and daughter.|Fresh
"We become the mute voice of society, quietly judging, urging for conformity so that all feels right in the world. Yet, that's the very thing this movie refuses to reconcile. Nothing is ""right in the world."""|Fresh
Both Foster and McKenzie display a profound respect for their characters and the journey towards peace that doesn't always keep them at the same pace.|Fresh
Compelling and compassionate, it's a powerful character study.|Fresh
"Adapted by director/co-writer Debra Granik and Anne Rosselini from Peter Rock's 2009 novel ""My Abandonment,"" Granik shows the same profound, compassionate understanding of human relationships showcased in her breakout hit ""Winter's Bone."""|Fresh
There's a patience and care to the way [Granik] makes movies, an appreciation for detail and nuance, that makes them bracingly different from any other movies being made.|Fresh
Its tender portrait of the relationship between father and daughter defamiliarises our fixed, often one-way understandings of care.|Fresh
It's a sad movie that's somehow full of hope. You leave with your heart aching but not quite broken.|Fresh
Leaves a haunting impression, and drives home the central question; how do we make choices for ourselves without hurting the ones we love? In Granik's world, it's not the answer that hurts - rather, it's the journey to find one that does.|Fresh
All of the movie's relationships, even those that last for a single scene, are quietly affecting.|Fresh
This is a family drama, not a Social Studies discourse, and in that respect, it succeeds with quiet grace.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is mostly a thoughtful, empathetic exploration of what really makes a home, and how hard-fought the battle can be to find it.|Fresh
A powerful, sensitive film that looks at those stuck between the obligations of society and the invisible scars that conflict leaves behind.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is a paean to empathy.|Fresh
A thoughtful story about a father and daughter who discover that kindness is good medicine.|Fresh
[Director Debra] Granik's latest cements her standing as a filmmaker of extraordinary craftsmanship and humanistic vision. She's poet laureate of the dispossessed, an artist capable of seeing both the forest and the trees.|Fresh
I recommend it as much for what it doesn't do as for what it does. It's a gentle, troubling drama that contributes to the sort of questions many of us have these days: Who are we now? Who are we really?|Fresh
...a movie that's willing to whisper.|Fresh
Granik fills the screen with humanity in an assortment of characters doing their jobs and at least offering the rare opportunity to connect with others|Fresh
Leave No Trace is a rarity, a movie that runs its finger over a deep vein of pain without offering palliatives or bromides. That feels unblinkered and right.|Fresh
"""Leave No Trace"" is almost perfect."|Fresh
Granik is generous but unsentimental; allowing every character, no matter how minor or briefly glimpsed, a measure of dignity. No one -- not even a leotarded Christian dance troupe called For Your Glory -- is made to seem ridiculous.|Fresh
Leave No Trace beautifully takes viewers on different but parallel journeys, those of the father and the daughter as one can't veer off his path and the other one must.|Fresh
Granik has created a breakout role for McKenzie... Hers is a name you will hear a lot of from now on.|Fresh
"An arguably more restrained and refined narrative than her excellent ""Winter's Bone,"" director Debra Granik's ""Leave No Trace"" is intimate story-telling at its best."|Fresh
Leave No Trace's exploration of powerful themes like the power of community and the kindness of strangers turns what appears to be a sad story on the surface into something very worthwhile.|Fresh
Granik's films also convey a strong sense of place, which is aided in large measure by cinematographer Michael McDonough.|Fresh
Tolstoy's observation that all happy families are alike gets overturned in Leave No Trace.|Fresh
"A kind-hearted drama whose consistent quiet and composure leaves you all the more floored by its low-volume, high-stakes conclusion, ""Leave No Trace"" continues 2018's welcome trend of confident, compassionate stories about those on society's margins."|Fresh
The movie, directed and co-written by Debra Granik, speaks volumes about family ties - in assured but hushed tones.|Fresh
Leave No Trace will leave an indelible mark on audience's memories.|Fresh
With top-tier performances by Ben Foster and newcomer Thomasin McKenzie, director Debra Granik has captured an authentic dynamic between two characters who find themselves at an impasse.|Fresh
You can't say enough about 18-year-old Thomasin McKenzie, whose nuanced performance here burnishes Granik's reputation as a discoverer and molder of exciting young talent.|Fresh
Leave No Trace immerses us in rugged and rain-saturated terrain, where it is easy to get lost and even easier to get into trouble.|Fresh
In a year full of films that explore the precious nature of father-daughter dynamics, Granik's feature is a standout.|Fresh
Leave No Trace speaks, not just to the trauma and the damage of soldiers who have seen too much in war, but wider questions of endurance and the soul that can touch all of us.|Fresh
Shot on location in the Pacific Northwest ... Leave No Trace contrasts, in gorgeously evocative visuals, the green lushness of nature with the withered barrens of Will's soul.|Fresh
With Leave No Trace, filmmaker Debra Granik revisits themes of female power years after the flawless Winter's Bone.|Fresh
This movie filled my heart, and it broke my heart.|Fresh
[Thomasin McKenzie] is a massive find. There is such wisdom in her presence...You can feel her seeing everything and taking it all in. There's such a naturalism to the way she responds in every single situation.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is further evidence Granik is one of the most talented directors around - and Ben Foster ranks among the finest and most intense actors working today.|Fresh
"I admire ""Leave No Trace"" for its minimalist approach, lead performances and overall tone, but didn't love it like many other reviewers. (Full Content Review for Parents - Thematic Elements, etc. - also Available)"|Fresh
It speaks in hushed voices, makes few fast moves and requires the viewer to infer a lot about its characters - and also to fear for their safety.|Fresh
'Leave No Trace' gets across its simple, beautiful ideas as lightly as poetry.|Fresh
With its Pacific Northwest setting, Granik evokes the same feeling and aesthetic as Kelly Reichardt...While Leave No Trace does not specifically take place in the present, it has added resonance for this particular cultural moment.|Fresh
Leave No Trace forms a beautiful, heartfelt testament.|Fresh
Their idyllic but fragile existence is interrupted when police officers capture them and they are catapulted into a social system that is well-meaning but clearly not a good fit, at least for the father.|Fresh
[T]he impact of this story is subtle, gradual, and filled with insight.|Fresh
Thomasin McKenzie's Tom is an affecting and multi-faceted character.|Fresh
This perceptive, deeply humane film will certainly belie its title and linger in your memory.|Fresh
Beneath the slight narrative, deliberate pace, and long stretches of quiet, Granik and her outstanding cast are busy flushing Leave No Trace with sadness and compassion.|Fresh
Ben Foster is making a career out of playing men who either can't or won't adhere to society's rules... But as Will in Debra Granik's Leave No Trace, he reinvigorates these baleful character traits by suppressing rather than expressing them.|Fresh
Granik is one of the most distinctive filmmaking voices we have; I'd love to see her make more features but I'm also glad she takes the time to do them right.|Fresh
"""Leave No Trace"" isn't a popcorn flick, but serious film buffs will find much to appreciate."|Fresh
In Leave No Trace, director Debra Granik continues to refine a style of tranquil intensity. The film's images have a rapt and pared-down power, with emphases that are never quite where you expect them to be.|Fresh
Ultimately Winter's Bone and Leave No Trace could not be tonally more different, revealing Granik to be a virtuoso filmmaker of a diverse, if too brief, oeuvre.|Fresh
A quiet movie filled with heart and hope. Will Debra Granik make us wait another eight years for her next narrative film? I certainly hope not.|Fresh
Foster and McKenzie are almost symbiotic here, with the young actress, a native of New Zealand, delivering a startlingly confident performance that is, by every measure, the equal of Foster's.|Fresh
I could have done with more electricity from Foster - ears pricked for danger, he seems to pose little himself - but the New Zealand-born McKenzie is superb. Her wary grey eyes seem to take in every leaf on every tree.|Fresh
It's both thought-provoking and life-affirming.|Fresh
Leave No Trace's real power lies in how intelligently and empathetically [director Debra] Granik engages with the subject of America's marginalised people.|Fresh
Foster and McKenzie spark the same chemistry through their combined acting talents, an achievement made more remarkable given how little dialogue there is.|Fresh
Leave No Trace asks all sorts of interesting questions about the nature of society and the rights of the individual versus the supposed common good. It looks tremendous, and is wonderfully acted by McKenzie and Foster.|Fresh
Where does Granik find these young, superb actresses? It's like she has a patent on it. But it's her skill as a filmmaker that leaves you gobsmacked; taking small tales about people living on the margin and making them resonate.|Fresh
The story, from beginning to end, is enthralling, mainly due to the anchoring performances by Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie.|Fresh
Debra Granik's drama about a damaged war vet (Ben Foster) living off the grid with his teen daughter, brilliantly played by breakout star Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie, is hypnotic, haunting and one of the year's best|Fresh
LEAVE NO TRACE starts off with great promise, particularly due to Harcourt McKenzie's presence, but in the end, it doesn't quite deliver for me.|Fresh
Tom's self-awakening creates a wedge in their relationship, and when the inevitable happens, we are neither surprised nor shocked. But more importantly, we are not sufficiently moved.|Fresh
In her first narrative film since Winter's Bone, director Debra Granik once again makes a compelling and human drama set in the wilderness , and once again discovers a bright new star.|Fresh
Debra Granik's third narrative feature, Leave No Trace, is a emotionally powerful film with a breakout performance from actress Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie.|Fresh
Fiercely involving in a way we're not used to, made with sensitivity and honesty.|Fresh
Whether this insular relationship can survive in the larger world is the source of such consistent, compelling tension that you do not notice until this close-to-two-hour film is nearly over that it contains almost no exposition.|Fresh
Director Debra Granik's 2010 'Winter's Bone' was a surprise stunner. So is this. Granik needs to make more than one film every 8 years.|Fresh
Foster and McKenzie are admirably restrained, acting mostly without dialogue, but with grimaces and twitches, glances and nods.|Fresh
It is the acting of the two leads that makes the film special.|Fresh
The film's so tight and intimate and quiet you feel as if you're at the campfire sipping pine needle tea with Tom and Will.|Fresh
This sensitive, brooding drama is an Oscar magnet.|Fresh
McKenzie's performance is shocking in its confident nuance and seemingly effortless naturalism, making every moment feel bracingly authentic.|Fresh
A story of deep emotional poignancy, with a grim political relevance.|Fresh
Every year a handful of small, independent American films show up that leave you breathless. Leave No Trace is one of them.|Fresh
Debra Granik's first feature since Winter's Bone is another backwoods winner. Foster and Harcourt McKenzie are standouts in drama about a powerful father-daughter bond.|Fresh
"It's clear from watching ""Leave No Trace"" that these are people, and this is a story, that Granik cares deeply about. It's rarer than you think to watch a movie in which this is the case."|Fresh
Beautifully shot, lyrical, and heartfelt, 'Leave No Trace' is also missing some of the edge that made 'Winter's Bone' so memorable.|Fresh
Thomasin McKenzie's performance blew my mind. Ben Foster says more with a look than most can with pages of dialogue. Terrific telling of hopelessness, homelessness and hope.|Fresh
By the end, though, Will and Tom feel all too human. And their predicament will have you in tears.|Fresh
An immensely moving portrait of a father and daughter who love each other, and who can't bear to be apart.|Fresh
With understated portrayals by both leads and a meticulous attention to detail, the film is both tender and evocative.|Fresh
Debra Granik is an exceptional filmmaker. Her output is small but each film is resolute and genuine. Her latest, Leave No Trace, maintains the high standards she's set. Leave No Trace is one of the best films I've seen this year.|Fresh
The beautifully observed details of this heroine's journey are heartbreaking.|Fresh
...never less than utterly arresting.|Fresh
While the meandering pace, which doesn't create any sense of urgency, may be a bit slow for some viewers, this is a richly drawn and rewarding film that stays with you.|Fresh
A thoughtful meditation on parents and children, on damage and courage, on communities we create, and on what we mean by home.|Fresh
"The director, Debra Granik, made a stunning feature eight years ago: ""Winter's Bone,""... Here's another stunner, and another revelation in the calmly radiant person of Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie."|Fresh
[Granik] brings McKenzie to the forefront. The young actress projects the dazed yet intelligent innocence of someone unfamiliar with the modern world.|Fresh
Despite Leave No Trace's humorless treatment and tragedy of its issues, McKenzie's incandescent ebullience blazes.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is a gorgeous story about adolescence, about basic human kindness, about separation and reconciliation, about the limits of what parents can teach their kids.|Fresh
Granik gives her characters room enough to breathe so we get a full sense of just how precarious their lives really are.|Fresh
[Thomasin McKenzie's] acting, like Foster's, is flawless, and their father-daughter rapport rings true from the film's first moments.|Fresh
Little is said and little happens - it's inaction-packed, if you like - yet it pulls you in and keeps you pulled in. I'm still turning it over in my mind days later. It will certainly leave a trace in you, in other words.|Fresh
Debra Granik has a gift for cinematic spaces that are vibrantly, palpably alive, and for putting you in places, whether modest homes or the great outdoors, that make you feel as if you're standing right alongside her characters.|Fresh
"This gentle, miracle of a film is almost an antidote to Matt Ross' ""Captain Fantastic,"" which explores similar themes in a comparatively showy, crude fashion."|Fresh
Leave No Trace is better than all its forebears.|Fresh
The movie shines a gentle but insistent light on America's underclass and walking wounded, the people in the cracks just getting by.|Fresh
"""Leave No Trace"" is a beautiful film, heartbreaking in the self-awareness - both existing and burgeoning - of its characters."|Fresh
While there's sadness in the movie, it's countered with hope, and Granik's faith in humanity proves contagious.|Fresh
Unlike Sean Penn's 'Into the Wild', which also explores the quiet radicalism of disappearing off the grid, there's no big emotional swells here. 'Leave No Trace' is a more hushed, contemplative movie.|Fresh
Leave No Trace lacks the ferocity that drove Granik's earlier features, as well as a ready hook for audiences; but it offers deeper sorrow and greater hope, as well as a direct line to a substratum of the American imagination.|Fresh
The movie belongs to McKenzie, whose extraordinary performance as daughter Tom is heartbreaking, inspiring, and unforgettable.|Fresh
Leave No Trace asserts, with exquisite humanity and a long bittersweet sigh, that the best the broken can do is disappear before they break anyone else.|Fresh
It sneaks up on you, then leaves you in paralyzed shock.|Fresh
Granik charts the evolution of their relationship in microscopic detail, harvesting from the smallest gestures the sort of emotion that screenwriters spend pages trying to rustle up.|Fresh
"Debra Granik, director and co-writer of Winter's Bone, is back with another-slightly more low-key, but still riveting-story of ""the other America."""|Fresh
The brilliance of Leave No Trace lies in its understatement.|Fresh
The jeopardy remains muted and subterranean until it sprouts at the very end.|Fresh
A slow-burning drama infused with both sadness and hope.|Fresh
This is a delicate, heartfelt character drama built around two of the best performances you are likely to see all year - and will leave you hoping that it doesn't take as long for Granik's next film to enter production.|Fresh
Tension, some peril in intense father-daughter drama.|Fresh
Granik doesn't spell out the connection between these characters. She doesn't have to. You feel it.|Fresh
When civilization feels threatened, starting over in the woods seems not only appealing, but maybe even necessary. Especially when seen though Granik's discerning eye. How lucky we are to have her work.|Fresh
Harrowing and enthralling in equal measures, it's a challenging and rewarding experience.|Fresh
Their journey from here may not be all that surprising, but it's a testament to the actors and director that it remains riveting throughout.|Fresh
Refreshingly, there's no artificial conflict... Confident filmmaking shows in every frame.|Fresh
Every moment and every character is charged with raw and real emotion. Describing Leave No Trace as a tearjerker barely scratches the surface.|Fresh
An equally tender and devastating father-and-daughter effort that's handled with supreme sensitivity and shot with unwavering kindness.|Fresh
It is small and, story-wise, slight, but quietly powerful in its detail and compassion.|Fresh
This is a film strongly invested in those marginalised by society.|Fresh
"""Leave No Trace"" should, by rights, be dull... Yet the movie's patient progress is driven and tensed, and you feel that, at every turn in the path, something could go badly astray."|Fresh
Debra Granik's haunting drama makes other living-off-the-grid films feel like pretenders.|Fresh
Captures like few other films a remarkable bond between father and daughter.|Fresh
Granik is a strikingly observational director, and she takes great care to avoid leading viewers in any direction.|Fresh
The heart of Leave No Trace is the rapport between the father and daughter, and McKenzie and Foster are keyed to each other's movements, perhaps even each other's thoughts.|Fresh
"Minimalistic, deliberate and largely silent, ""Leave No Trace"" clings to each word like an endangered species. It demands patience from the audience, but that patience is richly rewarded."|Fresh
Granik has exhibited a depth of feeling for these characters that is fair-minded and gentle, offering a nation's most broken and isolated progeny a safe fictional harbor in her film.|Fresh
Alive to the majesty of the wilderness and the sanctuary it offers a tortured soul, Leave No Trace is a rich and refreshingly apolitical portrait of rural America.|Fresh
Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie are sublimely cast, creating nuanced and indelible characters that will leave you in suspense about how they can come to terms with the world without breaking each other's hearts.|Fresh
Judging by both her talent and the Debra Granik seal of approval, we would say that Thomasin McKenzie is one to watch out for.|Fresh
There's a lot to watch and enjoy in this film that takes the time to look at faces properly and that constructs a totally believable world of misfits and underdogs.|Fresh
A small, intimate film, contained in both scale and content, but undoubtedly solid. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a movie that will live with me for a long time.|Fresh
Subtle but assured to the end, Granik's film is all undertow, but it irresistibly grabs you.|Fresh
A profound story about love, family, loyalty, understanding, and compassion.|Fresh
"A refreshing look at humanity in general, ""Leave No Trace"" is a universal, unforgettable experience."|Fresh
This is the gentlest I've ever seen Ben Foster. Of course, Will is still tortured. He's a veteran but he doesn't rage and he doesn't even lash out at people interrupting his peace. He channels it into something positive.|Fresh
While certain aspects ofLeave No Traceremain inscrutable, what's undeniable is the hopefulness Granik finds in those who live off the grid.|Fresh
As a depiction of a certain corner of American life, Leave No Trace is vivid and true.|Fresh
Granik and her Winter's Bone writing partner Anne Rosselini have once again burrowed into the lives of the truly forgotten people of the United States, only this time they're without a marketable whodunit hook.|Fresh
[Director Debra Granik] made a film of grace and power, a story of people lost and found in America that often shows us at our noble and humble best. How rare and refreshing that is these days.|Fresh
This is a movie driven by filmmaking, and [Debra] Granik's skill behind the camera drives a lot of the narrative forward. That and, of course, [Harcourt] McKenzie's performance.|Fresh
Early scenes of Leave No Trace feel like The Road. Not the movie adaptation, but Cormac McCarthy's book, which evokes familial intimacy to an almost harrowing degree.|Fresh
It's a film that never overwhelms but it lingers, leaving its mark on the viewer.|Fresh
Leave No Trace is a powerful statement about devotion, survival, and the interconnected threads that shape a society.|Fresh
Once again, Granik introduces us to a kind of family that cinema rarely captures believably, and she does so with a style that's both lyrical and realistic at the same time, anchored by a pair of unforgettable performances.|Fresh
It might not have the genre elements that helped make Winter's Bone something of a breakout, but Leave No Trace rivets and terrifies in its own way.|Fresh
The film is consistently at its best when it's attuned to a quiet sense of harmony between all things.|Fresh
"For fans of the director's ""Winter's Bone""... this unconventional family portrait shares many qualities with the 2010 film, including profound empathy for backwoods characters and the discovery of yet another young talent in Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie."|Fresh
An absorbing, delicately directed and acted father-daughter drama.|Fresh
