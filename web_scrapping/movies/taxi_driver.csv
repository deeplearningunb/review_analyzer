No other film has ever dramatized urban indifference so powerfully; at first, here, it's horrifyingly funny, and then just horrifying.|Fresh
Martin Scorsese's unflinching plunge into the darkest recesses of the human soul feels painfully relevant.|Fresh
De Niro ... manages to be as sad as he is frightening. From his general discomfort with others and his feeble attempts at communication, it's possible to recognize the root cause of Travis' inner distress as a terrible longing for approval.|Fresh
It's a powerful film and a terrific showcase for the versatility of star Robert De Niro.|Fresh
Bickle is complex, intriguing and never one-note.|Fresh
Like Werner Herzog's Aguirre or Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Taxi Driver is auteurist psychodrama.|Fresh
An absolutely nailed-on portrait of solipsism in its purest form, and how, in Travis' case, it takes hold as a lethal cocktail of narcissism, paranoia and gross sociopathy.|Fresh
Travis Bickle's trouble was that he couldn't get close to anyone, but Robert De Niro's trouble is that he can't get past the audio-visual pandemonium to show you Bickle's torment from inside.|Rotten
"""Herrmann's score moves like Bickle's eyeballs do: scanning, searching...left, center, right...searching...searching...for something it will never find."""|Fresh
if Travis is a contradiction, then so is the Vietnam-era United States in which he walks and drives - a schizophrenic environment where violence is always bubbling beneath the surface of dignity, decency and democracy.|Fresh
... a primal portrait and uncompromising vision carved out of the New York night, the summer heat, and the garbage of the Times Square cesspool.|Fresh
As with John Wayne's Ethan Edwards (Travis's spiritual forefather), his thwarted patriarchal possessiveness is not tempered by anything like genuine concern, yet it is enough... to make him a peculiarly American folk hero.|Fresh
Taxi Driver's undiminished power owes partially to Scorsese's harnessing of Michael Johnson's restless camerawork.|Fresh
A remarkable, disturbing film with an unforgettable musical score from the great Bernard Herrmann.|Fresh
It's a spiritual film, tracking Robert De Niro's 'Nam vet as he takes the wrong path towards cleaning New York's streets, minds and souls.|Fresh
A bloated yet sporadically electrifying drama...|Fresh
A masterpiece, perhaps the masterpiece, of American loner-ness, a portrait of a psycho as a young man. Scorsese's interest in raging bulls and New York City wolves would return, but his fifth fiction-feature remains his magnum opus.|Fresh
A frightening psychological journey of a troubled man towards total collapse. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
This is a wholly remarkable film, flaws and all. In fact, even the flaws are significant.|Fresh
The classic cinematic thunderstorm - Paul Schrader's cool, sexually repressed formalism drifting into the humidity of Martin Scorsese's lurid, urban expressionism.|Fresh
Taxi Driver is grounded in its socio-political context, yet it also touches on something more universal... how one finds purpose and identity in a collapsing capitalistic society.|Fresh
"[VIDEO ESSAY] So much of American popular culture, and modern Cinema's urban aesthetic, owes a debt to Martin Scorsese's groundbreaking fourth feature film that it is impossible to imagine a world without ""Taxi Driver."""|Fresh
even more unnerving than his own psychotic behaviour is the easy way in which [Travis Bickle] is assimilated and integrated into the very society that he endangers.|Fresh
What strikes you aren't just the iconic moments, but the little ones.|Fresh
Taxi Driver is a brilliant study of alienation, obsession, paranoia and perverse desire. There's an undeniable power and grittiness that very few films have come close to capturing since.|Fresh
Scorsese's masterpiece of urban alienation...|Fresh
A haunting, visceral trip through the mind of a man on the edge of his own sanity.|Fresh
This is an extraordinary film. De Niro in the central role delivers one of those powerhouse performances that simply blows the audience away.|Fresh
Melodramatic as it often is, the film is a riveting watch and De Niro provides a character study it is impossible to forget.|Fresh
The bustling helter-skelter of Scorsese's Mean Streets gives way to a measured, chilly calm, and cinematographer Michael Chapman ensures the Big Apple glistens with barely concealed menace.|Fresh
A high-water mark of American cinema gets its due treatment on this luxurious disc. No respectable collection should go without it.|Fresh
Scorsese generates plenty of atmosphere. There's a gritty look and feel to the story that perfectly captures 1970s New York City.|Fresh
Hitchcockian unease permeates the film, but so too does a Godardian use of space and a Bressonian focus on obsession heighten the mounting sense of dread.|Fresh
This DVD Limited Collector Edition of Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece contains many bonus features, such as docu about the making of the film, analysis of themes of alientaion and loneliness, interviews with Scorsese, star De Niro and writer Paul Schrader|Fresh
Portrait of a very disturbed man; NOT for kids.|Fresh
... a portrait in psychosis and dislocation with a protagonist whose racism and intolerance becomes his excuse to unleash his anger in a violent spree under the guise of heroism.|Fresh
Writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese made names for themselves with this exquisitely crafted window into the contemporary male psyche. Taxi Driver seems aimless, taking as many u-turns and detours as a cabby does in the night. But it's|Fresh
[Scorsese] seems to need scripts with well-designed humor and performers with the spirit of Ellen Burstyn to compensate for what seems to be a fundamentally depressed view of life and the belief that sobriety is the equivalent of seriousness.|Rotten
Martin Scorsese's masterly Taxi Driver both encapsulates and transcends its times.|Fresh
If you haven't seen Taxi Driver, your education in film hasn't even begun.|Fresh
|Fresh
One of the great films from the 1970s has been re-released with a new digital transfer from the original source material for high quality video and audio.|Fresh
Martin Scorsese's searing portrait of loneliness and violence on the mean streets of New York remains one of the quintessential films of 1970s American cinema...|Fresh
Get in and take a nightmare ride on perhaps Scorsese's best picture, the story of Vietnam vet Travis Bickle's fight to win the woman of his dreams in the seedy Big Apple.|Fresh
Acclaimed for its gritty realism, but it has an equal amount of cinematic reverie.|Fresh
The blend of Schrader's script, Scorsese's direction and De Niro's performance is both riveting and unnerving. A film that will stay with you forever.|Fresh
A grimy film that perfectly reflects its grimy subject matter. Travis Bickle [is] one of film's most complex characters. When you talk about super heroes, he truly is one minus the tights and powers.|Fresh
Is Travis a hero or a monster? The question is never answered to any satisfying degree, and Herrmann's score makes sure of that by always playing up the counterpoint of a scene.|Fresh
What a mad and brilliant film it is: 1,000-degree proof Seventies cinema.|Fresh
New York may have changed, but Taxi Driver is as powerful and painful as ever.|Fresh
An utter masterwork of shifting tones and flowering angst.|Fresh
|Fresh
Jarring urban psychological drama.|Fresh
Martin Scorsese's history-making scald is truly a phenomenon from another day and age. Which is to say, imagine a like-minded film of this decade killing at the box office and getting nommed for Best Picture.|Fresh
|Fresh
A compelling and unsettling film exploring many of the fears, aches and dislocations of contemporary urban life|Fresh
|Fresh
Powerful drama and portrait of insanity.|Fresh
A movie to educate us about life on darker sides of the soul, or steer us away from living that life. It draws us in with a conviction that makes us feel like we're living it.|Fresh
Scorcese's first masterpiece.|Fresh
You may want to argue with Taxi Driver at the end, and with good reason, but it won't be a waste of time.|Fresh
|Fresh
"Don't let the endless barrage of morons imitating the ""You talkin' to me?"" bit put you off."|Fresh
De Niro is brilliant, but the film as a whole is less successful than its formidable reputation suggests|Fresh
Director Martin Scorsese's nightmare vision of Manhattan is important, impulsive work.|Fresh
Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. Movies don't get any better than this.|Fresh
|Fresh
Centering on De Niro, the Michael and Julia Phillips production mixes politics, prostitution and philosophy as a complex man attempts to combat the corruption he can no longer tolerate.|Fresh
the dynamic trio of Scorsese, Schrader, and DeNiro have created the ultimate teen angst drama|Fresh
There have been few films that have created and sustained the sense of constant, underlying dread that pervades every frame of Martin Scorsese's scorching urban masterpiece|Fresh
...perhaps the quintessential 1970s American film...|Fresh
It is a brilliant, bloody movie with a haunting portrayal of urban life, and is arguably one of the top 10 movies ever made.|Fresh
For film buffs and those wondering what all the fuss is about, Taxi Driver remains a singular experience.|Fresh
The heart and soul of Taxi Driver are twisted in a way that can't be faked or copied.|Fresh
In a brilliant touch, Scorsese uses Bickle's voice-over narration, his continual talking to himself, as a symptom of emotional isolation and mental deterioration rather than for the usual exposition of or commentary on a story.|Fresh
Perhaps the most formally ravishing-as well as the most morally and ideologically problematic-film ever directed by Martin Scorsese, the 1976 Taxi Driver remains a disturbing landmark for the kind of voluptuous doublethink it helped ratify.|Fresh
An undeniably brilliant, nightmarish portrait of one man's personal hell.|Fresh
Its brilliant performances and haunting final Bernard Herrmann score assist in making this classic about as perfect as a movie can be.|Fresh
Probably did for cab drivers what Psycho did for showers.|Fresh
One of the great ones|Fresh
The symbolism used by Scorsese, the extremely effective acting by Robert DeNiro, and the superb writing by Paul Schrader, turn this movie into a cinematic adventure of many layers.|Fresh
A masterful psychological study, the depth of which can only fully be appreciated on repeat viewings.|Fresh
Taxi Driver is a brilliant nightmare and like all nightmares it doesn't tell us half of what we want to know.|Fresh
Since the mid-1970s, the movie has become presciently emblematic of our emotionally diseased, violence-prone culture.|Fresh
The thing I'm never sure about is whether Travis is actually psychotic, and Paul Schrader's script, Scorsese's direction, and De Niro's performance don't give us any easy answers.|Fresh
Its themes of urban decay, anomie and violence which infuse the impending sense of doom at the heart of this film still hang like black clouds over many cities today.|Fresh
So much of this study of evil is brilliant.|Fresh
Taxi Driver (1976) is director Martin Scorsese's and screenwriter Paul Schrader's gritty, disturbing, nightmarish modern film classic that examines alienation|Fresh
But despite anything, [the] average viewer at the end actually cheers for Travis.|Fresh
