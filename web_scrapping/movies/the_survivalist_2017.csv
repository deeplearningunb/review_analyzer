The Survivalist is well done and well produced, but it's a grim tale.|Fresh
Who knows how it will end, if it will at all. But we do know this: The Survivalist rolls out a uniquely personal vision and makes for a stellar debut by Irish writer-director Stephen Fingleton.|Fresh
It's not a fun film, but it is a tensely thrilling one.|Fresh
This deliberately paced post-apocalyptic thriller rewards patience with a character-based approach that gradually builds suspense.|Fresh
Fingleton makes a meal out of complex character drama, raking his audience over the coals with piano-wire tension that leaves you jittery long after the credits roll.|Fresh
The Survivalist...is as terrific and as suspenseful a post-apocalyptic thriller as any I'll likely see this year.|Fresh
Fingleton is largely successful with his tonal and visceral goals, only periodically allowing the ugliness of this story to reach beyond its grasp.|Fresh

It is one of the more original post-apocalyptic films to be released as of late and is a curiously thought-provoking one at that, but its bleakness will not appeal to all audiences.|Fresh

Fingleton writes and directs with gusto and flair.|Fresh
Suspense abounds, in this story, yet also an uncanny grace. Think of Mad Max, directed by an art house minimalist.|Fresh
This is a harsh, unsentimental science fiction film, though the performances suggest small surviving flames of empathy and yearning amid the tough, practical attitudes.|Fresh
As a calling card movie, it's mightily impressive; dramatically lean, gripping where it needs to be, and a story told with satisfying economy.|Fresh
A canny study of trust and loyalty.|Fresh
The Survivalist is a stunning, thought-provoking film that, despite its bleak focus, has a surprisingly uplifting message about the power of human connection.|Fresh
