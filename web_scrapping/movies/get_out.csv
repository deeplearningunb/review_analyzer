Get Out winks at centuries of painful history and honors it with an absurdist de-pantsing of race in America.|Fresh
Vestiges of the ingrained attitudes of centuries of slavery on the country's home turf still remain...[and Peele] uncovers and explodes them brilliantly in this hugely entertaining horror-comedy-satire.|Fresh
This film took me through every emotion and left me wanting more.|Fresh
Get Out is further proof of horror cinema's resurgence and burst in creativity, as well as being a great sign of things to come behind the camera for Jordan Peele.|Fresh
There are a dozen places where this could've all gone wrong and fallen apart, but Peele has clearly shown up to play.|Fresh
The horror of Get Out is not only the events that take place, but also the racism that fuels these events. Jordan Peele skillfully takes on a serious social issue in a unique light that results in a thrilling film dripping with dark humor.|Fresh
Jordan Peele has surprisingly revealed himself as a new potential master of horror.|Fresh
Peele dives fully into racial issues and the horror genre with Get Out and crafts one hell of an impressive debut.|Fresh
Jordan Peele nails his colours to the mast with a very entertaining, but also very obvious, horror number that seeks to satirise contemporary American race relations.|Rotten
What Peele accomplishes in this film is so far above what your everyday horror film is capable of. In fact, few films have the ability to open up discourse.|Fresh
Get Out didn't solve problems, but it gave an idea pictures-representation of a kind. What more could you ask from a movie?|Fresh
For black viewers, it is like their very own version of Dante's Inferno; for white viewers, it forces us to question our own complicity.|Fresh
This brilliantly provocative first feature from comic turned writer-director Jordan Peele proves that the best way to get satire to a mass audience is to call it horror.|Fresh
Get Out brings humour into the horror-thriller realm. By adding the laughs, Get Out adds a flair of fun and an odd sense of realism.|Fresh
A modern horror classic that is smart, funny, surprisingly unpredictable throughout.|Fresh
There are aspects that could stand better explanation within the plot, but it doesn't seem compromised, and it makes us jump, sweat and cheer in all the right places.|Fresh
I laughed, I jumped, I didn't cry... but what a way to come out the gate.|Fresh
Where the film fails is in the actual structure of the story, which is riddled with inconsistencies, gaping holes in the plot, and what seems to be a mid-point shift from one story to a completely different one.|Rotten
Everything in Get Out seems innocuous on first blush.|Fresh
"Funny, tense, clever and assured, Get Out speaks to the lie of the ""post-racial"" world without ever letting the white part of its audience off the hook."|Fresh
There were really strong performances throughout, especially from those playing Black people trapped inside their own bodies...to have that level of emotion...|Fresh
Even if horror or thrillers aren't your genre, it's still a great movie.|Fresh
Get Out is unusually smart for a February horror outing, effective and bracing. Its well- scripted and directed and deeply satisfying even if it causes some politically correct discomfort.|Fresh
"The cleverness of blending these genres, with a racial commentary that is razor sharp, is what got and kept people talking about ""Get Out."""|Fresh
"""Get Out"" is total escapism while being a wonderfully mind-bending story revolving around racism. To pull off that combination is absolutely extraordinary."|Fresh

Almost everything about this movie is both intelligent and raw.|Fresh
The layers are endless and once you realize the totality of what's happening, the events take on new meaning.|Fresh
You'll remember this little shocker a lot longer than you will the latest big budget flick to come out of the Hollywood meatgrinder this summer.|Fresh
Racism doesn't always have to be virulent, it can sometimes take benevolent and malicious forms as displayed in this haunting and topical film.|Fresh
A tasty performance from Kaluuya, together with Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford as the parents, but Peele is the star find here.|Fresh
Peele's parting thought is not to insist that we are destined to be slaves to the narrow thinking of others, but that we have a responsibility to remain cautious and vocal until such ideas have been destroyed. Get Out is an urgent call to that necessity.|Fresh
If you like to be scared, if you like to laugh, and if you like to learn a thing or two at the movies, this absolutely cannot be missed.|Fresh
In using both realities in his movie, Peele brings Get Out to a higher level of horror, at least for any person of color in the audience. We're all keenly aware of how possible it is.|Fresh

... let me advise you to get out - get out and see this sure-to-be-talked about film.|Fresh
Jordan Peele's debut will stand among the cream of the crop as far as 2017 horror films go. It's wildly ambitious, poignant, terrifying, full of laughs, a refreshing take on the genre with subversive tendencies, racially charged, and damn entertaining.|Fresh
Get Out...is not a comedy but a psychological thriller that--if anything--delves into satirical territory.|Fresh
As a keenly observed portrayal of the African-American experience, it seems every bit as important a film as Moonlight is, even if the Academy will probably never recognise its brilliance.|Fresh

Jordan Peele's Get Out is one of the more intriguing and provocative horror movies to come out of Hollywood in recent years.|Fresh

After playing with our expectations, this turns out to be a very different sort of film.|Fresh
Peele is smart enough to skewer all of white America and demand they wake up to the elephant in the room. Hypocrisy seems to be the name of the game. [B+]|Fresh
Peele uses Get Out to take control of black bodies and give black men in the audience an allegory that they've craved in horror for decades.|Fresh
With his over-the-top plot, [Jordan] Peele takes several racial themes to the extreme in Get Out. But what stood out to me the most was his take on white women's role in racism.|Fresh
Horror movies have bad third acts all the time; the hope is that they have two first acts that are this good, with such an excellent anchor as Daniel Kaluuya.|Fresh
The acting is good, and the firecracker script has some excellent ideas. But Get Out has fundamental holes, which mostly occur during the second half of the film.|Fresh
All considered, Get Out is the sharpest, most thoughtful, and against all odds, the funniest horror film that Hollywood has churned out in a long old while.|Fresh
[Jordan] Peele has served up the season's sharpest hunk of weird fun.|Fresh

Get Out is an unorthodox horror-thriller that could be game changer for the genre.|Fresh
Get Out is perhaps the best terror tale since the mid-2000s served up The Descent and Pan's Labyrinth, two masterworks that, like this one, have much more on tap than just creeping out audiences.|Fresh

Get Out: is a masterfully done horror film that builds its chilling menace slowly and does not reveal itself until it's too late to resist.|Fresh
Jordan Peele's Get Out contains a fascinating idea and some intriguing social commentary, but it's ultimately let down by bland execution and writing that never allows the idea to come to full fruition.|Rotten

Smart, entertaining, superbly-acted and shockingly funny, Get Out is a rare film that ticks all the boxes and works on a number of different levels.|Fresh
Jordan Peele's debut as a feature film writer/director announces him as a major talent with a big, big career ahead. Get Out is fabulous, a film that not only gets better as it goes along, but keeps getting better the more you think about it afterwards.|Fresh
I didn't feel the comedic elements always sat well with the rest of the film but that's a small issue with an otherwise gripping, intelligent and suspense-filled thriller.|Fresh
The film has enjoyed huge word-of-mouth success...yet it ultimately seems too frightened to face down the spectres of modern racism that it rouses. As pure genre entertainment, however, it does deliver sufficient bang.|Fresh
Get Out is definitely great now, and I'm taking a punt that it will be considered great for decades to come.|Fresh
It's a game-changer.|Fresh
[Director] Peele, who also scripted, is very good at writing barbed dialogue, and as the film proceeds the audience is likely to feel as uncomfortable as Chris.|Fresh

Get Out works the way it does because of its emotional purity. Chris's discomfort is real; Rose's chagrin with the way her family is behaving is real.|Fresh
Kaluuya brings a wry intelligence his role as the straight man to the films' many eccentric characters.|Fresh
It will probably end up being the best horror movie of the year, and easily one of the best of the past five years.|Fresh

Jordan Peele is known for being really good at comedy, and now it turns out he's really good at horror too.|Fresh
Peele's background in comedy serves him very well. The jokes are never riffed, nor do they feel less than organic to the plot.|Fresh

Don't be surprised if a knot sets up residence in your stomach as Peele toys with you.|Fresh
Jordan Peele's Get Out is so clever you could write a thesis on it the length of War and Peace.|Fresh

It lacks the subtlety of Night of the Living Dead, but deftly balances laughs and bloody thrills.|Fresh
It was 6 minutes before I yelped and 15 before I wondered if I'd packed fresh underwear.|Fresh
It's an auspicious debut to say the least, with Peele making good on his performance background in sketch comedy to make his points land with a sly wit that makes the horror all the more powerful.|Fresh

The film has more to do with discomfort and envy than blind hatred. What a strange marvel it is.|Fresh

A scary, funny and razor sharp social thriller, and the most exciting debut film this year.|Fresh
It's a brilliantly mischievous, unsettling movie.|Fresh
Bursting onto the film scene, Peele's directorial debut of Get Out was an unexpected success that will give future films to be released in 2017 a run for their money.|Fresh

"""Get Out"" succeeds by taking a fairly-standard horror format and invigorating it with a visceral social element."|Fresh
Nope, not going to ruin the movie. Suffice it to say there is creeping unease, heart-stopping tension, people who are not as they seem to be and a finale that is violent but which will knock your socks off.|Fresh
While Peele may be best known for his comedic offerings, this endeavour is far from funny - it's pretty disturbing stuff.|Fresh

After everything is revealed in Get Out you'll want to see it again to watch the pieces fall into place. Nice job, Mr. Peele.|Fresh
With strong visual sense and even stronger writing, Peele keeps us off-kilter, approaching the material from odd angles, challenging us to ruminate on racial paranoia.|Fresh
Writer/director Jordan Peele's Get Out has a deep lineage that includes films like Night of the Living Dead, The Spook Who Sat by the Door and Bamboozled - it's that good. And... funnier.|Fresh
Peele manages to perfectly balance suspense, humour, and horror while making a hard-hitting political statement about liberal America; a remarkable and timely feat considering the state of the world in 2017.|Fresh
While it is too violent for my taste, it does have some clever comic touches and an interesting racial twist on the usual horror genre story. It is kind of like a dark comic cross between '12 Years a Slave' and 'The Man With Two Brains.'|Fresh
"Get Out is a great movie for people who dislike or dismiss horror expecting ""gratuitous"" explicit violence and nudity, because of its humor, PG sex scenes, and the analogies drawn to contemporary lived experiences of race relations."|Fresh
It's because of Kaluuya that Peele's commentary remains intelligible throughout, even as the movie leaps over logical chasms and loads up on hammy supporting performances.|Fresh
First-time director Peele has not only written a brilliant script, but has mastered film grammar, timing, and the blocking of scenes (Splice Today)|Fresh

Get Out is an incredibly assured debut that totally gets horror. And comedy. And politics. And it's going to be one of the standout hits of the year.|Fresh
There's something almost playful about the way Peele weaves his tale.|Fresh
This is Guess Who's Coming to Dinner meets Six Flags' Kingda Ka roller coaster after surviving a car wreck while winning the lottery.|Fresh
Like The Stepford Wives before it, Get Out uses a fancifully exaggerated scenario to illustrate real social tensions.|Fresh
"The film wears its influences lightly (The Stepford Wives; the revelation's echo of Being John Malkovich, which starred Keener) even as it camera-tracks the dark side of a supposedly ""post-racial"" USA."|Fresh
Precisely because it addresses fears that have been absent from horror movies, Get Out is a future classic.|Fresh
The sense of dread is palpable throughout, but Peele leavens the fear with a great device in the comedic character of Rod, played by Lil Rey Howery.|Fresh
It plays and it creates an effective admixture of comedy and intrigue, and it takes dead aim at the zeitgeist in a way that's sure to garner attention ...|Fresh
Believe the hype, and go see it.|Fresh
There's either a bit of genius at play or this is one heck of a lucky first strike|Fresh

What emerges, with nods to the absurdist anxiety of Rosemary's Baby and the existential terror of Michael Haneke is a tightly wound, viciously funny comment on the quotidian horror of life in black America.|Fresh
a bristling thriller that ably mixes its various horror riffs-which include stalk-and-slash tensions, an insidious cult, and medical horror-with both comedy and social satire|Fresh
It's funny, it's tense, it features two great performances from Kaluuya and Williams and Peele expertly creates a web of odd tension where you actually don't know what is happening for the majority of the run time.|Fresh
Filled with righteous anger, sly wit and genuine creepiness, Get Out is a savvy, stylish and enormously entertaining film.|Fresh
Get Out knows how to mine a real social voice from simple scares, and turn a reliable thrill ride into the first truly great film of the Trump era.|Fresh
You may be reminded of other creepy movies like Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives, but this is neither a retread nor a spoof. It's a rare, seamless blend of horror and comedy: a stinging satire cloaked as a thriller.|Fresh
Get Out is an attenuated comedy sketch in which serious concerns are debased.|Rotten
Mark my words; it'll be a modern classic.|Fresh
Jordan Peele's Get Out is essentially Dear White People for sadists; it's a therapeutic horror comedy with a shotgun barrel aimed at the racial tension that's echoing through America.|Fresh
Retro horror and racial tension mix to surprisingly entertaining effect in Get Out, the feature directing debut of US TV comedy multi-hyphenate Jordan Peele.|Fresh
In the tradition of the best social thrillers, Get Out takes a topic that is often approached cerebrally -- casual racism -- and turns it into something you feel in your tummy. And it does it with a wicked sense of humor.|Fresh
All this diabolic lunacy, of course, Peele depicts with B-movie relish, delighting gamely in the comic-sinister thrill.|Fresh
It provides a few shocks and a few laughs, as it leave us something sinister to think about in our race relations while having a laugh at the expense of the liberal elites.|Fresh

One of the boldest, most audacious major studio movies to come along in quite some time. From the opening titles to the end credits, Get Out holds you in its grasp.|Fresh
Obama may be out of office, a fool may be in the White House, but leave it to Peele to make a film that plays with the notion that the masters of Get Out's white house might just be crazier than Donald Trump.|Fresh
A terrific comedy, but a somewhat muddled thriller.|Fresh

While it doesn't offer any answers, it both thrills and makes you think.|Fresh
Get Out is a bonkers little film that mixes humor, horror, and satire to comment vividly on racism in America. The genius of Jordan Peele's directorial debut, however, is that you don't need to catch all of the subtext to enjoy it.|Fresh
In most slasher flicks, a guy like Chris would die first. Peele's joke is that the cliché has it backwards. Young black men know their lives are in peril from the first frame.|Fresh
A movie that not only functions as a solid scarefest but a razor-sharp satire.|Fresh
