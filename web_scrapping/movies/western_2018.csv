Valeska Grisebach explores male group dynamics, aggression, class resentments and xenophobia in modern day Eastern Europe utilizing oater genre tropes and a non-professional cast.|Fresh
A slow-burning and tense drama which brings the Wild West to the Balkans.|Fresh
"""Western ... is, by the way, very far from being a mere referential game of western cinema: the dramatic structure of the genre is there, no doubt, but what happens does not necessarily agree with what we expect""."|Fresh
It's a powerful and haunting introduction to Grisebach's work, and certainly one would hope that the wait for a new film (this is her first film in over a decade) won't be anywhere near as long.|Fresh
Although the characters onscreen learn all too well how being unaware of history they're doomed to repeat it, the writer/director takes what she knows to boldly capture a time.|Fresh
This film by the German Valeska Grisebach retakes the essence of the classic genre alluded to in the title, but gives it more subtle forms, changing the duels and shootings by gestures and conversations. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The director Valeska Grisebach maintains a powerful acting force and scenes of pulsating drama where understanding reigns despite the ignorance of the foreign language. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Grisebach draws these men with three-dimensional, complex identities and watches them butt heads and shake hands knowing their inherent drama is enough.|Fresh
Western is a quietly captivating, subtle film that will stay with you and leave you thinking for a long time.|Fresh

The final product winds up being unsatisfactory. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
It should not be overlooked that in a story in which the protagonists are men, the eyes of a woman [director Valeska Grisebach] dissects them perfectly. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Western presents an abstract face that aims, without fuss, toward the fundamental enigmas of existence. The discreet conquest of that space of reflection ends up being its greatest triumph. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
With proverbial lucidity, Western expertly presents the contrasted weapons of black humor and border poetry. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A praiseworthy film that should not go unnoticed... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What counts is that barely perceptible space between salvation and guilt. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Full of objective humanity... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Western explores masculinity through a practice of 'radical observation' without judgment, attuned to the subtlest of gestures.|Fresh
This is a work of great physical packaging. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
What relates [Western] to the most American of genres is that it speaks of the tension between colonizers and natives, and... handles issues such as the vain, aggressive, fragile and competitive nature of the male ego. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
We get the sense that the tension between the locals and someone like Meinhard can never fully be resolved.|Fresh
There's swagger and bluster. There are echoes of Athina Rachel Tsangari's Chevalier, and at least one purposeful reference to Claire Denis's Beau Travail.|Fresh
The actors all deliver gritty, earthy performances that feel sometimes startlingly authentic. This means that most of the dialog feels improvised, with the language barrier adding layers of intrigue.|Fresh
None of the obvious story turns are taken which makes it interesting. It's too long but confident and interesting, albeit niche market.|Fresh
A meandering but quietly absorbing tale of comradeship amid social tensions.|Fresh
Valeska Grisebach's Western is a more stately, sombre, slow-moving affair, which upends the tropes of the western genre by removing them to a novel setting - southern Bulgaria, to be precise.|Fresh
Like the Hollywood westerns it references, it's a story of economic imperialism as an assertion of male dominance, the political implications of colonisation hanging in the air like stale sweat.|Fresh
A thoughtful tale of identity, flawed masculinity and the way past actions constantly haunt the present.|Fresh
The film's keen observations on male behaviour and displays of aggression and machismo, both individually and in groups, revealing truthful insights into the male mindset and body language, which provide Western with potent resonance.|Fresh
Meinhard becomes increasingly enigmatic - was he a soldier? Is he a liar? What does he really want? - and [Valeska] Grisebach, sometimes infuriatingly, offers us tantalising hints of a drama that never quite fully unfolds.|Fresh
Western's refreshing rejection of formula and celebration of cross-cultural connection proves highly resonant in an increasingly divided world.|Fresh
Western is allied to Claire Denis's Beau Travail and Kelly Reichardt's Old Joy, which observe the intimacy of all-male spaces. Grisebach too explores the ways men labour, act and interact, their unspoken and brittle bonds.|Fresh
Returning to film-making after a decade away, Valeska Grisebach confirms the good impression made with Be My Star (2001) and Longing (2006) with this bruising clash of macho cultures.|Fresh
The point of the title is to invoke a parallel, conjure a certain tradition. But it's the aggression and naked tensions of the genre that Grisebach has her eye on.|Fresh
One of the films of the year has arrived - maybe the best of the year - a work of unmatched subtlety, complexity and artistry.|Fresh
While the film hums with potential conflict, Grisebach is too singular simply to dress an old genre in new clothes. Instead, she coolly holds back her camera and paces out the escalation of hostilities under a humid Balkan sun.|Fresh
Packed with moments of beauty worthy of classic westerns, and makes you want to be more attentive towards others.|Fresh
Reworking familiar genre ingredients, from the mysterious loner to a close-knit rural community, it touches lightly on issues of European identity, toxic masculinity and the way the past never quite surrenders its grip over the present.|Fresh
A sparse drama and not a Western as hinted at in the title.|Fresh
The execution is lumpy and the logic is full of holes, but the message is there.|Fresh
That lost-at-sea quality sometimes extends to the movie itself. The two-hour effort requires patience, but rewards it, too.|Fresh
[Meinhard Neumann's] languid but confident gait is pure Randolph Scott, while his face, usually unemotive, breaks out in deep creases on the rare occasions he smiles: it's a John Ford landscape in itself.|Fresh
Writer-director Valeska Grisebach is terrific with cultural details, especially since the characters can't really communicate.|Fresh
The allegorical, mythical, and iconographic elements could've come off baldly, but Grisebach executes Western with such ease and subtly that its generic quality is organic.|Fresh
A potentially fascinating character study gets lost in a diffuse, minimalist film about the tedious lives of German construction workers laboring in Bulgaria.|Rotten
The heart of Western ultimately resides in a wonderfully open question: when a set of interrelated concepts are strung together to form a phrase, is that the same thing as a statement?|Fresh
The centerpiece for [Grisebach's] ideas remark on the tropes of classic western but stripped of its romanticism and replaced with a more observant, worldly perspective.|Fresh
The ensemble and milieu allow for some wonderfully organic tensions and commentary around masculinity and wanderlust.|Fresh
Western is not a full-on, triumphant success, but in individual moments the film is just too delightful to ignore.|Fresh
"The absence of anything traditionally ""painterly"" reflects an ambivalent attitude toward the kind of capitalistic pro-growth machinations on display in the film."|Fresh
"Perhaps the most salient and unsung thread in ""Toni Erdmann"" examined the shifting economic frontiers in Europe. This becomes the point of departure for ""Western"" which further scrutinizes the human scale of these permeable borders."|Fresh
A nuanced look at masculinity and cultural imperialism|Fresh
A feature by any other moniker would've proved as quietly powerful, but this one more than earns its genre and title.|Fresh
Western is the definitive slow-burn drama, one which sets up an interesting premise, characters and locations, then keeps adding new plot elements until the credits roll.|Rotten
The accurate analysis of masculinity presented by Valeska Grisebach [...] should find its place in the current cinephilia. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Brilliant exponent of the Berlin School, Grisebach tackles a masculine universe without falling into the truisms or the thick stroke. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Free of affectation and distinguished by a generosity and sincerity exceedingly rare in cinema, Western's poignant celebration of human resilience is nothing short of spectacular.|Fresh
Western is a good movie because it knows how to create a precise world with force and originality. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The clean, almost entomological look of the filmmaker is the main value of a film that lacks some punch narrative and expressive density. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film's visual execution and spare narrative style give it a timeless dimension that will lend some modestly exportable clout to an approachable and appealingly laconic drama.|Fresh
