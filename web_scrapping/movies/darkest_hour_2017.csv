It's dramatically engaging and powerful in its own right, but it is Oldman's outstanding performance that really pushes it over the top.|Fresh

It's Churchill that keeps Darkest Hour just above par through Oldman's absolutely heavyweight performance|Fresh
Oldman towers over everything, his Winston as full of self-doubt as he is of hubris and bombast. (Though after so many recent WW2 films I can only imagine the fights between props departments over London's last starched collar, gas mask or 40s typewriter)|Fresh
While Darkest Hour is an interesting examination of the first few weeks of Churchill's premiership, it suffers from its dedication to portraying him as a golden hero.|Fresh

As a marvellous character study, with Oldman heading up the film with a soon-to-be Oscar-winning performance, it is unmissable.|Fresh
I'm not saying we shouldn't make films about Winston Churchill, or historical figures like him. But we shouldn't be fawning over them uncritically, or canonizing actors like Gary Oldman in their making.|Rotten
Delbonnel's cinematography is particularly striking ... there's a persistent haze that's as equally eerie as it is strangely invigorating.|Fresh
Led by an astounding performance by Gary Oldman, Darkest Hour is a tale of finding hope amidst hopelessness and how one unusual leader was able to rally a nation towards an unexpected victory.|Fresh
Joe Wright doesn't rest on the incredible work of his lead actor. A crisply paced film with many layers, thanks to a supporting cast that brings depth to the story and Wright's sharp eye behind the camera.|Fresh
Tip-toes on the edge of British propaganda, only seeking to showcase Churchill as a heroic politician, which makes for a very one-sided affair.|Fresh
It's fascinating and will leave you feeling excited and inspired upon leaving the theater.|Fresh
I needed more than paint-by-numbers scripting to fill in the blanks between those legendary speeches.|Rotten
"It's worthy of an award for ""most acting"", but as for giving the year's best performance, that accolade should be reserved for a performer who disappeared in to their character, instead of merely disappearing into the excessive make-up design."|Rotten
In (Oldman's) hands, Churchill is realistic. He's insecure. He's uncertain of himself ... in relation to the situation he finds himself caught up in. This take is unique|Fresh
Darkest Hour demonstrates the immense courage Churchill had. It doesn't fully absolve and deify him, rather humanizes.|Fresh
Wright has made a film of great words and visual elegance, but fueled by what is one of the year's greatest performances.|Fresh
I don't want to undermine my admiration for Gary Oldman's performance, but I think the film itself is flawed.|Rotten
The film stands strong and tall as one of the most prominent biopic films.|Fresh
You'll leave the theater stunned -- not only by what the British accomplished in WWII, but also longing for leaders whose words touch the hearts of their citizens.|Fresh
For an actor who has spent his career embodying unclassifiable human enigmas, it's unfortunate that [Gary Oldman] and Wright chose to depict Churchill in such broad, deliberate strokes.|Rotten
While Oldman is absolutely fantastic...this isn't even the best Winston Churchill performance of the year (that would go to Bryan Cox...in the film 'Churchill').|Rotten
... a fascinating look inside the war room of a former empire considering actual surrender in the face of insurmountable odds... and what it takes to overcome them.|Fresh
As the credits rolled, the strongest opinion I had about it was a shrug.|Rotten
Gary Oldman anchors a fascinating look at the war room behind the scenes of the evacuation of Dunkirk.|Fresh
Oldman brings plenty of fighting spirit, transformed by strikingly realistic prosthetic make-up to play the then 66-year-old with a spry mind, cranky demeanour and creaky body propped up with whiskey and cigars.|Fresh
Wright doesn't allow us to forget that all the words, speeches, and arguments are not only about politics but also about human beings, men on the beaches and stuck in trenches who are being killed and sacrificed.|Fresh
[Darkest Hour] inspires and gives more than would be expected from yet another biographical picture. Aside from a few moments when it feels slightly overdramatised, it's a definite success. I'd recommend it highly.|Fresh
Nevertheless, Darkest Hour is entertaining and beautiful to watch.|Fresh
"""Darkest Hour"" is a brief, and presumably misleading, biopic aimed more at winning awards for acting than in connecting our modern political problems with those of the past."|Rotten
It's unclear whether Joe Wright, the film's director, is trying to fight fire with fire in Darkest Hour by using a filmic style associated with the rise of Hitler to tell the story of an outmatched England preparing to fight the Nazis.|Rotten
In Darkest Hour, Wright's charged, blustery framework pulls the audience into a distant political landscape. But his approach here is also limiting and nearly wearying.|Fresh
It's when Churchill is at his most beleaguered that Darkest Hour spirals off into the further realms of fantasy.|Rotten
Joe Wright is less interested in historical details, more cinematic detail, and that leaning makes for an absorbing and flamboyant spectacle with Gary Oldman's barnstorming theatrical take on Churchill at its heart.|Fresh
Darkest Hour may be a little average in its telling of these critical events of WWII, but what it lacks in narrative power, it more than makes up for with a grand sense of style and a phenomenal performance from Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill.|Fresh

The ever-reliable Kristin Scott Thomas is the standout among the supporting cast, as Churchill's stoic wife. If only for Gary Oldman's Oscar-calibre performance, and hers, Darkest Hour merits a trip to the multiplex.|Fresh

You come, and you stay, for Oldman ... [His performance is] uncanny, it's technically virtuosic, it's mesmerising ... [he] gets the humour, the doubt, the drunkenness, the moods, the intelligence, the heart and soul.|Fresh
Wright infuses the film with as much style as it can hold without becoming unduly bloated|Fresh
Darkest Hour is pretentiously flawed in its obvious award-baiting, but well produced and rousing enough thanks to Gary Oldman in one of his most impressive performances.|Fresh
If you aren't interested in this stuff, it might lose you. [Gary Oldman] is engaging, there's no doubt about it, but the subject matter could lose you.|Fresh
For Gary Oldman to embody that, when we already know the audio of the real man's voice, I thought it was just a magnificant performance.|Fresh
There are many representations of Churchill and the King, many more depicting Britain and its soldiers and people during WWII, so Joe Wright had a lot to follow with this film, and quite a bit to live up to, however ,Darkest Hour was excellent.|Fresh
"The pejorative ""Oscar bait"" is immaterial when it's this good."|Fresh
Oldman's superlative work prohibits the movie from fading into the hedges like dozens of other dehydrated period pieces.|Fresh
Generally this is a rousing, immensely entertaining crowd--pleaser with a thoroughly mesmerising performance from Oldman in one of the finest hours of his career.|Fresh
It is unapologetically wordy. And at its best, this showcase for Churchill's ornate verbal flourishes is rousing and satisfying.|Fresh
Oldman wins, with a bespoke version of his distinctive voodoo. The sight of Churchill scarfing down eggs, bacon and whisky for breakfast is, in its own way, as rock'n'roll as the sight of Sid Vicious windmilling his bass in Sid and Nancy.|Fresh
A film that is watchable and entertaining, but rather stilted dramatically, unimaginative in its storytelling and a little too in thrall with its waddling hero.|Fresh
Oldman gives a performance rather than an impersonation and Darkest Hour is all the better for it.|Fresh
As far as the overall package goes, Darkest Hour is kind of just proficient, a perfectly competent and effective period film. What elevates it is Oldman's full-bodied, tour-de-force performance.|Fresh
Not event Oldman's brilliant performance can save the awful screenplay - and the scene in the subway is a perfect summation of the script's many flaws. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Rotten
Personally, I would prefer a rerun of Dunkirk or The Crown. But what Darkest Hour lacks in imagination is made up for, to an extent, by Oldman's presence.|Fresh
A feature-length Oscar clip, two hours of Gary Oldman stomping around in a Winston Churchill suit. There's too little drama and too much inevitability in what amounts to a reanimated Madame Tussaud's waxwork scene.|Rotten
Oldman delivers the greatest-hit speeches not just with mastery of cadence but with enough raw power to make the exceedingly familiar sound fresh.|Fresh
Essentially, Darkest Hour is a thriller, skilfully woven out of events to which we all know the ending.|Fresh
Oldman makes the role entirely his own, by turns mischievous, grumpy, panicked, vulnerable, blustering, stubborn and a whole host of other adjectives besides.|Fresh
Ultimately, if you want to hear Churchill talking about fighting them on the beaches, you could just watch Dunkirk again - Oldman's performance is literally transformative, but Darkest Hour is just another pedestrian biopic.|Rotten
Darkest Hour is one of the better examples of the British prestige pic, an absorbing study of an over-mythologised political figure that depicts him not so much as a hero as a principled man snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.|Fresh
Oldman dominates the film, capturing Churchill's outsized, blustery personality, along with a mischievous sense of humor ...|Fresh
Oldman seizes upon his character's many flaws and magically turns them into saving graces...|Fresh
... Darkest Hour is a mostly entertaining, enthralling and at times very moving film.|Fresh
Oldman's performance is the sole, sufficient reason to see a film in which little else finally lingers.|Fresh
It's a remarkable performance, any way you look at it, and one of the unreliable Oldman's best.|Fresh
Director Joe (Atonement) Wright exhibits his trademark flashes of visual aplomb and captures the peril of Nazi invasion with thrilling immediacy, despite being almost entirely confined to the claustrophobic corridors of power.|Fresh
When it comes to triumphs, here's one for the ages.|Fresh
Who wouldn't want to see the Nazis taken to task by George Smiley, Count Dracula and Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg?|Fresh
No disrespect to either John Lithgow or Brian Cox, but this is the Winston Churchill performance from the past year to you need to see.|Fresh
This isn't an uncritical celebration of British bulldog spirit but a nuanced portrait of Churchill at a key point early in the war.|Fresh
It is interesting mainly because it was made at this particular historical moment and for the messages it delivers to us right now. Though not a major cinematic achievement, the movie is valid - and worth seeing - for this reason alone.|Fresh
The film is carried by Oldman, of course, who can now add Churchill to his career gallery of real life characters that includes Sid Vicious, Beethoven and Lee Harvey Oswald.|Fresh
Taking us from Chamberlain's resignation to the aftermath of Dunkirk, the film resists no opportunity to indulge in clunking exposition.|Rotten
It's an amazing performance: the only star turn I've seen in which a famous actor visible in nearly every scene would be unrecognisable if we didn't know his name already.|Fresh
Oldman is sheer joy in a role which transcends an otherwise uneven affair.|Fresh
An Oscar-aimed turn from Gary Oldman anchors this WW2 portrait of Churchill at his most beleaguered. Just mind the gap...|Fresh
Gary Oldman is magic as Winston Churchill. Just give this man the Oscar already. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's no argument that this is a polished production from director Joe Wright.|Fresh
Gary Oldman plays Churchill, and suffice to say that if he finally wins an Oscar, it will not be undeserved.|Fresh
Darkest Hour may be brash, but it's never less than riveting when actors such as these are doing their stuff.|Fresh
[Director Joe] Wright's restless camera tracks Churchill's immortal words as they fly from his mind before landing on the pages of typist Miss Layton (Lily James). This is mental activity framed as martial arts.|Fresh
Gary Oldman might finally win the Oscar that has long eluded him for his sterling portrayal of the British Bulldog.|Fresh
Despite its flaws, Darkest Hour is still worth catching, just to watch a seasoned veteran such as Oldman show you the craft he has practised and perfected over the years.|Fresh
Grappling with Churchill's inner humanity and steely resolve, Oldman has offered a portrayal for the ages.|Fresh
The period piece of the year combines good historical accuracy with a vibrant portrayal of prewar Britain.|Fresh
It is [Gary] Oldman, though, who rules. As he did while portraying characters as diverse as punk-rocker Sid Vicious and the fictional spy George Smiley, Oldman again disappears into the role.|Fresh
Casting Gary Oldman as Churchill seems like a risky gamble, given that both are known commodities. But Oldman, who has already portrayed such disparate figures as Sid Vicious, Lee Harvey Oswald and Ludwig van Beethoven, proves to be up to the task.|Fresh
Darkest Hour takes a while to get going, but once the pieces are in place and Churchill gets down to business, Wright's film picks up a great deal of momentum.|Fresh
The pandering to modern sensibilities left me feeling insulted, and it would be enough to derail a better movie than this.|Rotten
There's something wrong when a biopic's best scene never happened in real life.|Rotten
Sure, it's a paint-by-numbers biopic about British Prime Minister Winston Churchill facing down the Nazis, but when the acting is this good, who gives a damn|Fresh
Mostly just boring in-between the bits where Oldman says something famous.|Rotten
If history is of any interest to you, this is one of three current films dealing with one of the most momentous events of WWI|Fresh
Intelligent and informative, with a knockout central performance by Gary Oldman.|Fresh
Comparisons with the powerful 'Dunkirk' are inevitable, but Gary Oldman soars as a bigger-than-life Winston Churchill in a first-rate, historical film.|Fresh
...more about a singular powerful performance rather than telling a cohesive and satisfying story.|Fresh
With impeccable direction, engaging dialogue, consummate costume and makeup, and one of the best performances ever to grace the silver screen by Oldman, Darkest Hour is an overwhelming achievement.|Fresh
"Oldman's Star Shines Bright in ""Darkest Hour."""|Fresh
Therein lies the joy of Darkest Hour: watching someone like Oldman ply his trade in what may be a career-defining role. The movie in itself offers plenty. Oldman offers more.|Fresh
[Oldman] plumbs the depths of Churchill's character in order to give us a three-dimensional take on the iconic, dour-faced politician.|Fresh
This film is a showcase for Gary Oldman's powerful portrayal of Churchill. Just as masterful are the makeup and prosthetics artists who make Oldman look like Churchill.|Fresh
Truly a political film, Darkest Hour aims to fulfill the needs of its constituents.|Fresh
"In a time when the film scene is flooded with sequels, remakes, spinoffs and an avalanche of superhero adventures, it is considerably miraculous that a film like ""Darkest Hour"" manages to stand out. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
It's a stirring portrait of real political leadership that makes Darkest Hour not just a lively slice of history, but also relevant for today.|Fresh
Aside from Oldman's frisky pleasure in hamming it up, Darkest Hour collapses in a great pile of hogwash.|Fresh
"""Churchill just mobilized the English language and sent it into battle,"" Halifax admits at the end. But did he really need a 100-piece orchestra to do it?"|Rotten
A sturdy biopicture about Winston Churchill's triumphs and struggles as England's Prime Minister in 1940.|Fresh
It's too long. Everything the film has to say could have been easily and neatly packed into 80 brisk minutes.|Rotten
... a handsomely produced, dialogue-driven history lesson that rests on the broad shoulders of its indelible protagonist, Winston Churchill.|Fresh
Darkest Hour is a fine film about Winston Churchill and his decision-making as Hitler swept through Europe that will ultimately be remembered for one thing: Gary Oldman is Churchill.|Fresh
Oldman takes the reins of Darkest Hour. It's his performance, capturing the British bulldog's oratorical fire but most important his life-affirming lightness, that makes this movie worth sitting in the dark for two hours.|Fresh
Darkest Hour demonstrates how, considering that everything and most everyone were working against Churchill, it's fairly extraordinary that there's still an England.|Fresh
With a blubbery voice and a penchant for cutesy physical movements, Gary Oldman does a smashing impersonation of Benny Hill's Mr. Scuttle, but the resemblance to Britain's wartime leader isn't quite there.|Rotten
Oldman has always possessed the ability to disappear behind the roles he plays, with and without latex, and his work here is further proof of his talent. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Gary] Oldman also does justice to Churchill's famous inspirational speeches, delivered in the dark, tradition-bound chamber of the House of Commons.|Fresh
A visual symphony of performance, pacing, editing, cinematography and music that only Wright and perhaps three or four other directors are capable of conducting.|Fresh
"Britain's ""Darkest Hour"" turns out to be Gary Oldman's finest."|Fresh
It scores on any number of technical levels, but it's Oldman's award-worthy performance as Churchill more than anything that proves to be the linchpin to the whole exercise.|Fresh
Ultimately the film over-romanticises its subject and, in so doing, fails to illuminate the real complexities of this pivotal moment in social and political history.|Rotten
So the verdict is mildly mixed. Darkest Hour isn't as great as the historical moment it depicts but Oldman's performance certainly rises to the occasion.|Fresh
Gary Oldman blubbers and bellows from under wads of makeup as Winston Churchill in this lifeless biopic.|Rotten
The script - and Oldman's portrayal of Churchill - make the movie riveting. Yes, folks, words really matter.|Fresh
A nagging question persists throughout Darkest Hour: Is Oldman's compulsively meticulous turn here anything more than a brilliant impersonation?|Rotten
Wright's restlessness can be off-putting, but his technique feels like a reasonable match here for the high-stakes subject matter, and the heightened (but not hammy) pitch of the performances.|Fresh
Which is why Darkest Hour transcends its biopic trappings to work, almost despite itself. It's a beautiful thing, Wright's film.|Fresh
Joe Wright's Darkest Hour stylishly follows Winston Churchill's early days as Prime Minister with a transformative performance from Gary Oldman.|Fresh
It's somewhat interesting to witness the events that led to one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century, but not 2 hours, 5-minutes worth of interesting.|Rotten
"Except for the make-up job on Oldman, not much to write home about--least of all the idea that Churchill was defending ""Western Civilization"" against the brutes. Tell that to the Indians and Kenyans."|Rotten
A superb portrayal of Winston Churchill.|Fresh
... manages to capture Churchill's high-profile charisma as well as his eccentricities during the film's quieter and more contemplative moments.|Fresh
Oldman's turn here at times feels like a great performance, and at others, like a parody of a great performance.|Fresh
A career-capping personal best for Oscar contender Gary Oldman. Kristin Scott-Thomas and Lily James also shine.|Fresh
Oldman commands every inch of the frame, and director Joe Wright often finds him in dark spaces, with a shaft of sunlight miraculously touching only him.|Fresh
Everything about the film is exemplary and would fit well on a double bill of history with Dunkirk.|Fresh
Gary Oldman's transformative portrayal of Winston Churchill in Joe Wright's Darkest Hour achieves the same rarefied orbit as Marlon Brando's interpretation of the Godfather. If this be critical blasphemy, so be it.|Fresh
Darkest Hour rises above the trappings of its genre thanks to a stirring performance by Gary Oldman.|Fresh
Wright tones down his usual visual flourishes, but his dramatic command is the strongest it's been in years.|Fresh
While Dunkirk is all visceral action and Their Finest gentle satire, however, Darkest Hour is mostly talk, focusing on political negotiations between the faction who wanted to sue for peace and those who wanted to fight...|Fresh
Oldman disappears into the role...and Kristin Scott Thomas is impeccable in showing us Clementine's elegance and resolve.|Fresh
Makes you wish we had someone like Churchill to help fight the Nazis this time.|Fresh
It's less effective in crafting a portrait of this man outside of the political and military realm.|Rotten
From an historical point of view, there are aspects of Wright's film one might debate, but, capped by Oldman's strong performance, it's one of the better recent films about the great British statesman.|Fresh
Joe Wright slathers this biopic with self-conscious artistry, but Gary Oldman is terrific as Churchill.|Fresh
By showing Churchill's fears and anxieties, Oldman elevates the man from a two-dimensional historical figure to a flawed human being, who mustered the courage to meet a great and grave challenge that could alter the course of history.|Fresh
"Far from being a dry biopic, ""Darkest Hour"" reminds us that some things - such as honor and freedom - are worth fighting for."|Fresh
As played by [Gary] Oldman, Churchill has perhaps never seemed greater. Or more human|Fresh
Buried under pounds of makeup, puffing cigars as if his life depended on it and railing against the Nazis (Nazzis in his pronunciation) at every turn, Oldman is terrific.|Fresh
The main attraction here is Gary Oldman as Churchill. As an act of physical transformation and emotional expression, it's something close to supernatural.|Fresh
"""Darkest Hour"" pulls from both extremes of Oldman's prodigious but often unexploited skill set, the subtlety as well as the flamboyance."|Fresh
"As a portrait of leadership at its most brilliant, thoughtful and morally courageous, ""Darkest Hour"" is the movie we need right now."|Fresh
"""Darkest Hour"" is a persuasive window into history, and so arresting in its portrait of one of the 20th century's most important leaders that every minute of it is absorbing."|Fresh
"""Darkest Hour"" is good, glib entertainment."|Fresh
Director Wright, a renowned maker of Oscar bait (Atonement, Pride and Prejudice), coats the action in the hazy ochre tint that spells H-I-S-T-O-R-Y, but it's Winnie we want.|Fresh
There hasn't been a historical figure this convincing and meticulously brought to life since Daniel Day-Lewis put on the iconic black top hat to play Abraham Lincoln|Fresh
Nimble Brit director Joe Wright arrives again; it seems like he's always arriving every couple of years, every other film announcing himself as a bold maker of thumping entertainments, who alternates precise, startling work with fancies that fail.|Fresh
Suitably stylish, emerging as a career-defining Oscar vehicle for Gary Oldman.|Fresh
Churchill's darkest hour is Gary Oldman's finest. Gripping, touching, amusing and enlightening, his performance is the prime reason this film must be seen - but not the only one.|Fresh
Mr. Oldman's interpretations of the great man's speeches elevate this film...|Fresh
In every aspect, Oldman proves a charismatic draw.|Fresh
A stirring but flawed World War II film.|Fresh
Now it's Churchill's turn to be shrunken down to a more manageable size.|Rotten
A history lesson for many and an acting clinic for most, Darkest Hour features an outstanding cast and inspirational themes, some of the elements of good cinema.|Fresh
Oldman is quite special, nevertheless. It's a performance that's as technically astonishing as it is, simply, fun to watch.|Fresh
"""Darkest Hour's"" greatest achievement is reminding us how different the world almost was but for one man's ability to lead others to fight against fascism."|Fresh
"While ""Darkest Hour"" is a showcase for Oldman's incredible performance, Wright's aesthetic visually transports the viewer, the images heavy with subtext and meaning."|Fresh
It is always Gary Oldman's phenomenal performance that keeps the film airborne.|Fresh
Were Darkest Hour just a symphony of World War II nostalgia, it'd probably still be a good watch. But because the film makes the effort to go deeper, it becomes something much more memorable.|Fresh
How badly we need another Winston Churchill film is open to question. Nonetheless, Joe Wright's contribution to the genre is welcome, largely because of Gary Oldman in the leading role.|Fresh
It is not a bad movie, or even a mediocre one. And yet it's an impossible film to get all that worked up about, because it seems to exist solely so we can all weightily exhale over how much Gary Oldman has Disappeared Into His Role.|Fresh
"""Darkest Hour"" is a by-the-books biopic anchored by a towering performance."|Rotten
The film as a whole is a bit flawed, but when you put such a glorious piece of acting into the recreation of a captivating piece of history, it's hard to go too far wrong.|Fresh
Gary Oldman delivers a career-defining performance as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.|Fresh
Pure Hollywood Poppycock. The War Cabinet, including Chamberlain, was almost totally behind Churchill and opposed to Lord Halifax's desire to sue for peace, not the contrary shown in this movie. This entire movie is fiction, and shame on it for that.|Rotten
The movie has sweeping cinematic texture, expressed in Wright's affinity for long takes.|Fresh
Oldman ... seizes upon the role of Winston Churchill the way an old bulldog takes hold of a lamb bone. He gets his teeth into it. He shakes it about. And he will absolutely not let go until he's gotten every bit of marrow out of it.|Fresh
Hidden behind resplendent latex jowls, Gary Oldman plays Churchill as a stout-hearted but deliberative man who's willing to paddle against the political tide, but doesn't arrive at his confidence easily.|Fresh
This ambitious film takes what we know as history and captures the immediacy and uncertainty of that fateful period. But the real strength ofDarkest Hour-and the reason it must be seen-is Gary Oldman.|Fresh
Too bad that, for all of its political savvy and recently unearthed details, the movie built around this magnificent performance gets corny and cutesy with dispiriting regularity.|Rotten
What distinguishes Darkest Hour is that it's a film based on words: the three famous speeches Britain's prime minister rallied the world with in 1940.|Fresh
There is definitely greatness in the way Oldman takes a role that has already been played by so many actors, and makes it utterly his own. Don't bet against him flashing that 'V For Victory' sign on Oscar night.|Fresh
Darkest Hour is a stirring film and an entertaining one, and it feels inspiring at the end of a trying year.|Fresh
The film itself may skirt stodginess, but Oldman, who has played everyone from Sid Vicious to Ludwig van Beethoven to Lee Harvey Oswald, never does. (The extraordinary makeup job is courtesy of Kazuhiro Tsuji.)|Fresh
Mild but talky look at Churchill's early days in power.|Fresh
An immensely important time period, but [one that] also succeeds in feeling tremendously relevant.|Fresh
The transformation makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji and Oldman achieved in this film is mind-blowing.|Fresh
While Gary Oldman's phenomenal work as Winston Churchill had been heralded in advance, it is astonishingly equaled by the film's achievements in direction, screenwriting, score and cinematography.|Fresh
The movie doesn't quite extract blood, sweat, or tears, even if it does toil.|Fresh
Oldman's portrayal of Churchill is that much more forceful and convincing, thus he should be the front-runner come Oscar season for Best Actor.|Fresh
Did the world really need yet another version of Winston Churchill's first few days in office? With Gary Oldman portraying the crusty Prime Minister, the answer is yes.|Fresh
Darkest Hour is more challenging and even more revelatory than run-of-the-mill awards-season releases.|Fresh
Hello, Oscar! Gary Oldman gives the performance of the year as Winston Churchill in director Joe Wright's rip-roaring take on the celebrated Prime Minister's first tumultuous month in office.|Fresh
Gary Oldman gives an impeccable performance as Winston Churchill in a gorgeously photographed, suspenseful World War II film that suffers from too much hero worship.|Fresh
I don't think we'll ever see anyone else do Churchill this well again unless the man himself comes back from the dead.|Fresh
"""Darkest Hour"" is proud of its hero, proud of itself and proud to have come down on the right side of history nearly 80 years after the fact. It wants you to share that pride, and to claim a share of it. But we have nothing to be proud of."|Rotten
Oldman's brassy presentation goes well beyond a collection of mannerisms. It gives us a sense of a flesh and blood person behind the bulldog-fierce political leader who presided over his country's celebrated World War II resistance.|Fresh
Gary Oldman should probably skip past Oscar talk and jump directly to knighthood for Darkest Hour, a screen portrait of Churchill against which all others will be measured.|Fresh
All the political infighting and wartime drama is just window dressing for Oldman's performance as Churchill, and it's one for the books.|Fresh
The film has a crisp British comportment-a dutiful, cheerio resolve-that serves it quite well.|Fresh
Darkest Hour is fine, but forgettable. You can feel the filmmaker's fear of failure in every bog-standard biopic scene.|Rotten
Oldman's leonine prowling satisfies as statesman theater, even if there are scenes that too easily tip toward mythic silliness.|Fresh
Few actors put their blood, toil, sweat and tears into a role like Gary Oldman.|Fresh
...a film predicated on dialogue and performance, and in those areas it delivers completely.|Fresh
It's a rousing wiki-deep summary of the gist of Winston Churchill's first month in power, from his assumption of the office of prime minister to his delivery of the second most famous to-arms speech in British history.|Fresh
... a lukewarm academic final result. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The performance is a marvel, not merely leaping over what could have been a stunt, but deepening into a soulful portrayal of wartime leadership, tinged with ego, doubt and the demands of a terrible moment.|Fresh
Polished Oscar bait with an award-worthy performance by Gary Oldman.|Fresh
Gary Oldman hasn't done a deep dive into a character for years, but he makes up for lost time with a spectacular performance as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, rousing the country to fight the Nazis against all odds at the start of World War II.|Fresh
Oldman immerses himself so deeply in the role that the actor disappears.|Fresh
The cast often transcends the hokum of the screenplay.|Fresh
...a handy political strategy companion piece to the more abstracted combat narrative of 'Dunkirk.'|Fresh
Oldman has disappeared into roles before - from Dracula and Beethoven to Sid Vicious and Lee Harvey Oswald - but never so wholly and superbly as in director Joe Wright's Darkest Hour.|Fresh
The details aren't as important as the grand sweep, and these historical figures are tools to illustrate big, fat human themes of perseverance and identity.|Fresh
Darkest Hour is a worthy companion to Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk because it reveals how difficult it was for the politicians to engineer the earlier film's valiant rescue.|Fresh
Darkest Hour runs the risk of falling into standard historical drama territory, but Wright and screenwriter Anthony McCarten work hard to avoid that stigma.|Fresh
It's hard to say the star doesn't deserve an award, but it's easy to state that little else about the movie does.|Fresh
Rousing, riveting and triumphant, this portrait of a hero is electrifying in terms of the genre and the awards season rush.|Fresh
It's unafraid to indulge in cinema's ability to create these fantastical scenarios.|Fresh
Though Wright directs only a few scenes of pure melodrama, his interpretation of Churchill's character visualized through all the man's hesitations and doubts, may be the most authentic yet portrayed on film.|Fresh
The new movie about Winston Churchill's rise to leadership in World War II could actually be a prequel to this summer's Dunkirk. It is about the decisions made that led to Operation Dynamo. It could even be a bigger Dunkirk Cinematic Universe.|Fresh
Gary Oldman has given us his gift to cinema with his effulgent interpretation of one of history's most complex political figures.|Fresh
How better to locate such counterintuitive heroics than through a retroactive contextualizing of Churchill as a least-likely-to-succeed buffoon (albeit with a gift for rhetoric)? Cue Gary Oldman as Oscar bait.|Rotten
This film won't have as much longevity as Churchill's immortal speeches, despite the fact that many viewers will likely laud Oldman as the definitive Churchill.|Rotten
There are many corridors that the film could have explored to flesh out the contradictions that informed its subject, but they're kept out of view, all the better to reinforce an image that's been solidly in place for 70 years.|Rotten
When presenting a biopic of such a famed figure, you hope to leave having learnt something new about them, and yet here we seem to be treading over familiar ground, albeit in a rather entertaining way.|Fresh
But the one reason to see the movie is Gary Oldman, whose embodies Churchill in a staggering performance, one that ranges from the mumbled nuance of a dithering alcoholic to the towering rhetoric of a supernatural statesman.|Fresh
Darkest Hour showcases a performance by Gary Oldman that is so good, you'll often forget you're watching an actor working from a script.|Fresh
It is a staggering misstep in a film that does not trust the power of the unvarnished story of Churchill's premiership.|Rotten
Jowly, bald and portly, [Oldman] matches all the familiar physical characteristics of Churchill with an expert approximation of his vocal mannerisms from an alcohol-slurred splutter to the spellbinding rhetoric that inspired a nation at war.|Fresh
Gary Oldman has never been better and he can consider himself the winner of that Oscar because I highly doubt there will be a better performance this year.|Fresh
Wright's staging is often eye-catching, guaranteeing that the film remains unflaggingly watchable even in its plodding stretches.|Fresh
An urgent retelling of a pivotal moment in world history.|Fresh
Darkest Hour is a study of age and power, and the achieving and decline of both.|Fresh
Gary Oldman has already locked up the Best Actor statue.|Fresh
Darkest Hour is a timely film, then, a call to arms from the Brits to the Yanks again that the bad guys are actively plotting the end of the world and isn't it time America did something. Isn't it?|Fresh
There's a living, breathing soul at underneath all that makeup, at the center of all those tics, and Oldman makes him fascinating to watch.|Fresh
An acting exercise weighed down by costumes, make-up, and over-lighting that has a few things to say about the backbone of a great world leader but nothing you haven't really heard before.|Rotten
Gary Oldman carries off a tremendous performance here, and it's impossible not to enjoy it.|Fresh
The magnificent clutter of Buckingham Palace or the swirling staircases of Whitehall begin to read like empty gestures in film that, for all that Oldman soldiers away at it, cannot make Churchill's dilemma dramatic.|Rotten
Darkest Hour will be known and remembered as Oldman's show.|Fresh
"Like its central character, Darkest Hour has ""mobilised the English language and sent it into battle."""|Fresh
The film is far less ostentatious than Joe Wright's previous works, rather leaving all the showboating to the worst performance of Gary Oldman's career, a Winston Churchill impression that plays out like a procession of award show clips.|Rotten
It's a rousing, engaging chronicle of British politics, and also a surprisingly moving story about great leadership.|Fresh
It feels alive and fresh -- the kind of cinema that doesn't waste a second.|Fresh
The MVP here, the one person who's able to hold the movie together despite all the dodgy bits in its latter half, is composer Dario Marianelli... his score for Darkest Hour is a rare thing of beauty.|Fresh
Balances the great orator's public triumphs with more vulnerable private moments of self-doubt, elevating the inner workings of British government into a compelling piece of populist entertainment.|Fresh
A snappy and straightforward crowd-pleaser that focuses on new Prime Minister Winston Churchill's mighty efforts to rise to the occasion of rescuing his country from the appeasers and defeatists in Parliament and stirring the public to defiance of Hitler.|Fresh
Few would argue that Gary Oldman isn't one of the finest actors of his generation, but this is a tour de force portrayal that will define his body of work for decades to come.|Fresh
