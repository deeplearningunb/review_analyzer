A hopelessly attenuated round of mistaken identity, cloak-and-dagger doings, sympathetic but helpless friendly agents, a double-dealing woman, and so forth.|Rotten
Hitchcock is such a master of suspense that not many frames have passed before the audience has achieved complete identification with the characters and is knowing the thrill of vicarious fear and the shared pleasures of love and passion.|Fresh
Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch that's equalled by a charming performance from Grant.|Fresh
Smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining.|Fresh
A great film, and certainly one of the most entertaining movies ever made, directed by Alfred Hitchcock at his peak.|Fresh
At times it seems Hitchcock is kidding his own penchant for the bizarre, but this sardonic attitude is so deftly handled it only enhances the thrills.|Fresh
What a beautiful film. Hitchcock confirms his care for details in this romantic story about confusion, paranoia and surprising love. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
Nearly getting killed never looked like so much fun.|Fresh
You know, whether the film is first- rate or not, that you are going to have fun there: because Hitchcock him- self is invincibly good fun and pretty well every- thing he touches becomes so too.|Fresh
By seeming to acknowledge the insanity that surrounds him and taking droll pleasure in it, Grant implicitly allows the audience to revel in it too.|Fresh
This is the purest piece of entertainment filmmaking we have had from him in some years; it is also, which does not inevitably follow, the most purely entertaining.|Fresh
Though North by Northwest boasts some of Hitchcock's most ambitious and memorable set pieces it is also one his most terrifically funny, playful moving pictures, cutting just the right line between suspense and belly laughs.|Fresh
As the template for a certain kind of old-school confection - Cold War, Wrong Man - it's unbeatable.|Fresh
...a tenuously engaging thriller that could've used a few more passes through the editing bay...|Fresh
The iconic actors give memorable performances, the story is perfectly pitched and fiercely clever and under the astounding directorial eye of Alfred Hitchcock - American Cinematic God - it's nearly flawless.|Fresh
It has all the classic elements of a Hitchcock film - well timed suspense, an overall mystery, a compelling cast and some brilliantly conceived scenes.|Fresh
Witty Hitchcock thriller. Not for little ones.|Fresh
ideal introduction to the Master and all his basic fears and craftsmanship|Fresh
The Blu-ray edition... has a stunning richness and clarity that practically glows in gorgeous overripe Technicolor hues: pure Hollywood gloss.|Fresh
There is no George Kaplan, but there is still spiffy, hypnotic pleasure in this apex of the Master's perpetual-motion mode.|Fresh
The picture is hugely pleased with itself, but it's too funny and expertly calibrated to mind in the least.|Fresh
...romance, excitement, suspense, and humor in equal measure. (50th Anniversary Blu-ray Book Edition)|Fresh
One of Hitchcock's most enjoyable and entertaining films is also one of his most quintessential works, dealing with thematic and visual ideas well ahead of their time, as for example the notion of fluid identity.|Fresh
North by Northwest, Alfred Hitchcock's very own adrenalin-fuelled action blockbuster.|Fresh
The romcom suspense caper is a cinematic recipe that Alfred Hitchcock took with him to his grave; certainly I can't imagine anyone now succeeding in blending thrills, spills, caresses and laughs the way he did in this sublime classic from 1959.|Fresh
Hitchcock succeeded in wanting to give popcorn munchers a movie to smile at. And he was never this playful again.|Fresh
Ernest Lehman's cheeky script, Bernard Herrmann's score and several sizzling set-pieces deliver a rush of pure joy.|Fresh
Welcome and much needed proof that great action movies don't have to be meaningless and moronic.|Fresh
Cary Grant's suave adman Roger O Thornhill finds himself in mortal peril as the innocent man-on-the-run, yet the tone throughout is buoyantly, almost insolently, comic.|Fresh
The velvety villainy of James Mason, the crop duster chase and the thrilling finale scrambling around Mount Rushmore are just part of the pleasure in a classic that deserves to be seen on the big screen.|Fresh
See it again and you'll come away marvelling.|Fresh
Not Hitchcock's most profound work, but a tightly conceived, expertly executed thriller from the master of suspense.|Fresh
Certifiable classic territory, Hitchcock's glossiest entertainment is the closest the trickster ever came to an action movie.|Fresh
The great suspense director was at his most entertaining, creating a helter skelter action film where the hero is propelled from one breathless situation to the next.|Fresh
|Fresh
Rich imagery, with many links to Vertigo.|Fresh
All in all, an improbable classic.|Fresh
One thing I've always admired about Hitchcock is that he has a very distinctive directing style, but he never makes that style the star of the movie.|Fresh
More than a clearing house for Hitchcock's auteur tendencies.|Fresh
Thrilling, funny, and romantic; it elevates popcorn adventure to art...defines the ideal use of star power....[and] marries deadly intrigue to out-and-out delight. [Blu-ray]|Fresh
|Fresh
... one of those great movies that cannot withstand the barest amount of scrutiny - it is the sort of movie movie that can exist only because we are willing to collaborate with its directors and stars. Fifty years on, it keeps on ticking.|Fresh
|Fresh
Hitchcock's direction is a little flabby, but for sheer enjoyment, there's no better primer on the master's methods.|Fresh
A diverting adventure, but in truth, a little precious... Not my favorite of Hitch's later films.|Fresh
Pure genius.|Fresh
One of Alfred Hitchcock's great films.|Fresh

A thriller so improbable that it becomes quite brilliant in evading even the most fantastic of audience guesses.|Fresh
represents Hitchcock at the height of his cinematic talents|Fresh
|Fresh
Viewer friendly, refreshingly undated, and worth as many repeat viewings as one can stomach.|Fresh
Hitchcock's ultimate wrong-man comedy.|Fresh
This isn't one of Hitchcock's deeper films, but it's certainly one of his most entertaining.|Fresh
One of the best films ever made.|Fresh
...quintessential...Hitchcock at his most playful, Cary Grant at his most debonair.|Fresh
North By Northwest is still a classic, coming as it does during Hitchcock's most creative period, but it lacks that extra little taste to make it truly great.|Fresh
North by Northwest (1959) is an Alfred Hitchcock classic, suspenseful comic thriller - one of the most entertaining movies ever made and one of his most famous|Fresh
