If you're looking for a fun 2-hour escape from the world, this is it. End-to-end action, tension, and WTF moments. Chapter Two is just as good as the first, if not better.|Fresh
While John Wick: Chapter 2 has plenty of engaging action, it's the layering of nuance and detail that really elevates it.|Fresh
Chad Stahelski and Keanu [Reeves] not only match the merits of the first film with John Wick: Chapter 2, but even exceed the first in many forms. John Wick is back!|Fresh

John Wick: Chapter 2 is all about confidence, confidence in its concept, its own internal universe, and its lead.|Fresh
While not as emotionally centered, narratively focused, or consistently engaging as the original, there's still plenty to love about the continued story of the maligned John Wick ...|Fresh
Extremely violent and deadpan funny, this is an elegantly bleak sequel that dares us to suspend disbelief just long enough. The assassins' expanded world is great fun, and it turns out John can speak nearly as many languages as Amy Adams in Arrival.|Fresh
I was blown away by the amazing action and combat scenes in this film. With many sequels never coming close to their predecessors, John Wick 2 sets the sequel and action bar high for 2017.|Fresh

John Wick: Chapter Two isn't a masterpiece of cinema and that is precisely the point. It is entertaining, exciting action that revels in its own cheesiness and delivers elegantly staged spectacle.|Fresh
The 55 year old Reeves has found a muse in Stahelski, who constructs jaw dropping fight sequences, films them with an unparalleled proficiency, and gives Reeves a spotlight to display his remarkable on screen fighting skills.|Fresh
Everything fans of the first film wanted and little else.|Rotten
It's another John Wick movie. I shouldn't have to say another goddamn thing.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 is a very serviceable sequel that could have been an improvement over its predecessor if it weren't for its ambitions far exceeding the film's grasp.|Fresh
This is the fine wine of action films, classily designed and feeling elegant every step of the way.|Fresh
Action films don't get much better than John Wick: Chapter 2.|Fresh
"Disability needs to stop being used as lazy way to make a character more ""exotic""."|Rotten
John Wick: Chapter Two builds gloriously off the first film as Keanu Reeves once again dominates the screen.|Fresh
Everything is spelled out and fed to us. The wires are exposed. John Wick is but a mere blip in the larger picture, which is global in scope.|Rotten
Bigger and better than ever, this film perfectly compliments what has come before whilst still standing on its own two feet. Gone is the revenge thriller, 'graphic novel come to life', replaced with a story that feels very steeped in Greek mythology.|Fresh
Exceeds all expectations by expanding its universe with imaginative action sequences that deliver bigger and better the second time around.|Fresh
An antidote to overly elaborate action films, John Wick: Chapter 2 doubles down on both the mythology and the violence of the first film, delivering a great followup that doesn't lose sight of what makes it so damn entertaining.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 doesn't radically subvert the genre, but it doesn't intend to. What it does is something so much better: it loves it and celebrates it with charm, skill and devotion.|Fresh
Chapter 2 is far more ambitious than the original, it's colourful and it's brilliantly put together. Scenes are densely choreographed, action or not and the script is pure fun.|Fresh
From foot races to car chases, the action I wanted to see in this film is all here, and in spades.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 is an example of what makes a satisfying sequel. Its stakes are greater and, while a bit too familiar at times, has more than enough new material to warrant the attention of fans of the first film.|Fresh
The bullet ballets are terrific, the mano-a-mano stuff almost as good as the Raid movies.|Fresh
Blisteringly violent, fast-paced, utterly daft, John Wick is a rip-roaring piece of entertainment with Reeves still the king of cool as the man in black.|Fresh

Keanu Reeves' best work since The Matrix... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There are clear plans for a John Wick: Chapter 3, but unless they refocus on meaningful characters and dramatic conflict beyond slaughter, I will not be there to watch it.|Rotten
Definitely not as good as John Wick one, but if you're a fan you will definitely love this movie.|Fresh
In this cinematic space woven of pure genre, Reeves' Nietszchean hero is all at once entrapped victim, avenging angel and ruggedly individualistic rebel.|Fresh
I look forward to the third part. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Action sequences as sublime and precise as hilarious and brutal. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Two hours of nihilistic, non-stop violence with barely a plot and one of the most annoying music scores of all time. It makes me weep for our future.|Rotten
The best of John Wick 2, and the franchise in general, comes when everyone involved focuses on doing what they do best. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Rather than merely retreading the well-worn and bloody path of the first film, ""Chapter 2"" opens with a mythos, showcasing an international realm of intrigue."|Fresh
Reeves as Wick isn't much in the dialogue department, but the actor excels here with complex fight choreography that is mesmerizing to watch.|Fresh
[John Wick 2] is a clever extension into the world we were teased with in the first - filled with gold bullions, luxury hotels for assassins, and lots of insane fighting.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 obliterates its predecessor and is one of the greatest American action films of the decade|Fresh
John Wick 2 verges on perfection thanks to the choreography orchestrated by the filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director Chad Stahelski's highly anticipated sequel more than delivers on its promise to be not just a great action movie, but a great movie. Period.|Fresh
It might not do much to your brain, but it'll certainly set your heart racing. If you're in the mood for blood, Wick is your pick.|Fresh
In the same vein as the movie's excessive themes, John Wick: Chapter 2 should be called a modern action classic.|Fresh
I rather like the noir-ish comic-book touches, but the killings are endless and the plot paper-thin.|Rotten
Just as good if not better than its predecessor|Fresh
In 2017, Chapter 2 is a triumphant return for cinema's coolest action anti-hero.|Fresh
Add some pitch black humour, a great supporting cast, nods to 60s super spies and a psychedelic mirror-walled showdown, and it is all great.|Fresh
It's beautiful, obsessed with surfaces, and drenched in blood, and the results couldn't be more striking.|Fresh
We all know the movie is preposterous, so it doesn't have to wink at us.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 delivers another full-throttle round of brutal, beautiful violence.|Fresh
"... despite its dependence on the original, ""John Wick: Chapter Two"" is top shelf revenge as stylish as the protagonist."|Fresh
If you liked the first one, you'll positively love this next instalment in the straight-faced action franchise starring Keanu Reeves as a hitman who absolutely everybody wants to kill.|Fresh
Powering it all is Reeves as Wick, a hitman who wants nothing more than to leave the life behind yet seems born to it, so at home on the hunt and under fire that it seems to give him purpose.|Fresh
Everything from the choreography to the cinematography is a conscious, well-executed decision. It's the kind of control and dedication to the craft that make John Wick: Chapter 2 such a worthy successor to the first.|Fresh
In the end it's a shallow sort of fun, a flimsy facsimile of the first film's frenetic genius. Perhaps this was an action movie that didn't need a sequel, after all.|Rotten
Stahelski and his crew have drawn on their creative juices to craft action scenes that don't feel repetitive. There's something a little different about each one.|Fresh
I wasn't a huge fan of the recently-released Free Fire, but having now sat through John Wick: Chapter 2, UK director Ben Wheatley's virtuosic 70s warehouse shootout feels like War and Peace.|Rotten
Reeves' grim perseverance sometimes feels like it's in a different film to the vivid brightness splashed around him.|Rotten
Roman catacombs, classic artworks, neon-lit nightclubs and a mesmerizing hall of mirrors are the stunning backdrops for a sublimely choreographed, sophisticated ballet of brutal killings in this John Wick sequel.|Fresh
Once again stunt man-turned-auteur Stahelski orchestrates scene after scene of gracefully choreographed carnage.|Fresh
It's too long and unfocused compared to the concentrated simplicity of the first film.|Rotten
Although perhaps not for all audiences, John Wick: Chapter 2 is everything an action fan could wish for.|Fresh
Turns sticking with what works into an action opera that knows when to dazzle with a symphony of shoot-outs, but also knows when enjoying Keanu's menacing presence is enough.|Fresh
It's a more audacious, visually adventurous effort, matching expertly choreographed knife-to-the-balls Wickian ultraviolence with strikingly Baroque, even hallucinatory, mise-en-scne.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 is a big, angry, joyous sequel that more than earns its place alongside its predecessor.|Fresh
Basically this is a film about nothing, but you could also call it art for art's sake, with some of the most elegant action since the 1980s heyday of Walter Hill.|Fresh
The return of a perfectly-cast Keanu Reeves as the title character -- a black-suited, blank-faced assassin with a peculiarly colourful code of ethics -- is nothing short of a trashy triumph.|Fresh
A balletic murder-opera, John Wick Chapter 2 ups the ante and expands the universe of the original sleeper hit. Deliver us Chapter 3 immediately, Keanu.|Fresh

John Wick: Chapter 2 isn't perfect. Doesn't matter. It's fantastic.|Fresh
A righteous follow-up that's bigger and maybe not better, but just as good as its predecessor.|Fresh
It's bigger, better, funnier and even more stylishly violent. But it's still thematically concise: Vengeance. Reprisal. Retribution. Wrath. Consider the Old Testament righteously evoked.|Fresh
The bounty on Wick's head that turns the hit man's life into a nonstop epic battle gives the story an expressionistic, existential underpinning: Isn't living under a death sentence an extreme metaphor for what all of us do?|Fresh
Retains most of what was good about the original, while ramping up the action to a more exciting level (Splice Today)|Fresh
Director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad reteam with star Keanu Reeves for John Wick: Chapter 2, a surprisingly necessary sequel to their left-field 2014 action success.|Fresh
A vast improvement over 2014's John Wick...|Fresh
Unlike so many films of its type, this is one of the rare times when the idea of another sequel feels more like a promise than a threat.|Fresh

The plot may be banal or even if you're not a fan of action films, this one it's above many other movies of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The original film... was adored by many, but it simply is not everyone's cup of celluloid. And this sequel is not going to broaden its appeal. It will however seriously satisfy fans of the first film.|Fresh
As [he] cuts a swathe through his enemies, there isn't the zoomed-in quick-cutting that action movies so often deploy to whip up a sense of excitement. Instead, the camera simply hangs back to let us see Wick in full flow and admire his fatal handiwork.|Fresh
An adrenaline-pumping blockbuster polished to near perfection, save its sequel-baiting conclusion.|Fresh
Chapter 2 is this series' The Empire Strikes Back, if that movie had a running gag about murdering people with pencils.|Fresh
Stylish and slick, it's a ballet of violence.|Fresh
This wick is far from burnt out, as John Wick: Chapter 2 serves up another helping of brutal fun.|Fresh
The real star of the film remains Reeves's face, which becomes bloodied and riddled with cuts and yet remains completely imperceptible. It suggests a rich inner life and aids the plot's philosophical pretensions.|Fresh
The way the world is right now we need all the popcorn escapism we can get and this one is a slam-bam knockout.|Fresh
As wonderfully crafted as they are (and for me the choreography knocks La La Land into a cocked hat), there's always a danger the violence could become a bit numbing. Thankfully, the film-makers know precisely when to puncture the killing with comedy.|Fresh
John Wick was a surprise hit that might just be the best action movie of the decade. Its sequel could end up becoming a contender for second-best.|Fresh
A pulp fiction flick of almost operatic grandeur, Chapter 2 yields one helluva good time at the matinee. Have a blast.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 succeeds in building upon the foundations of the first film, being an enhanced version of the original in every way, giving us a more insightful look at both Wick and the world around him, while ratcheting up the action to 11.|Fresh
It's jam-packed with comic-book conceits presented with the brisk drollness of Terry Gilliam.|Fresh
I think it's more than fair to point out that fans may miss the emotionally driven and epic purity of its action-packed predecessor.|Rotten
Another superb mix of cool imagery and coherent action.|Fresh
The effect is a little bit like a diet of cake and ice cream. You thought you wanted it. Yet you yearn for the broccoli of conversation and characterisation.|Fresh
When it comes to choreography, the spunky dreamers of La La Land have nothing on the death dances Reeves leads. This movie's balletic brutality and relentless pacing are breathtaking. Or maybe that's just a No. 2 pencil shoved in my throat.|Fresh
The funny thing about John Wick: Chapter 2 is that it's the exact same movie as John Wick: Chapter 1-- and yet somehow manages to work almost as well.|Fresh
There's an art to this; at times, the 'John Wick' movies are less narratives than dance recitals.|Fresh
This is John Wick we're talking about. It is said that he once killed three men in a bar with a pencil (a pencil!).|Fresh
While it may not be quite as slick and polished as the first instalment and its occasionally over-the-top gags will not sit well with some, John Wick: Chapter 2 knows what fans want and it undoubtedly delivers.|Fresh
It is such a hoot, watching him shoot everyone in the nightclub. He shoots them in the face, under the chin, through the temple. Blam! Blam! Blam! Screams! Gore! Death!|Rotten
Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a fantastically enjoyable follow-up to one of the best action films of recent years.|Fresh
An action film that shows the genre at its gruesome, graceful best.|Fresh
One fundamental problem is that John Wick is well-nigh indestructible. That means the element of threat simply isn't there.|Rotten
If Neo reunited with Morpheus in a two-hour John Woo/Hugo Boss/Gillette advert floats your boat, this bloody, gruesome, dumb, daft and really good fun movie is ready and waiting.|Fresh
Squeamish need not apply, but - as with the original - there's more on offer than just over-the-top, video game-style violence.|Fresh
I wasn't a fan of John Wick which gave Keanu Reeves a new lease of life as an inscrutable, invincible action man. John Wick: Chapter 2 is even more ridiculous.|Rotten
Chapter 2 will pass a Friday or Saturday night as mindlessly as its predecessor.|Fresh
"The movie's exceptional second half closes in on establishing its lead as the defining action antihero of the decade. ""Chapter 3"" just might get him there."|Fresh
Even before the hour mark the film has become too predictable and while Reeves gives it socks, his mirror-in-the-attic magnetism and unique gift for making an eight-course meal out of every line can only go so far.|Fresh
Stupidly enjoyable as all this is, by the time this Wick burns out, you might actually be wondering if there is such a thing as too much.|Fresh
A sequel is entirely welcome, and Chapter 2 does its job entirely ably, without exactly doing much overtime.|Fresh
Look at it like a dance movie and you'll find choreography that puts recent musicals to shame. La La Land can suck it.|Fresh
An impressive film due to the spectacular nature of the images, but above all because of Stahelski's decision to accompany his protagonist from the back and prolong the scenes beyond the usual cut. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 Raises The Bar On American Action.|Fresh
This sequel doesn't show us anything new about John Wick. The plot provides excuses for a lot of gun fights, fist fights and knife fights that go on and on. It is ultra violent and ultra senseless.|Rotten
The run-shoot-kick-stab schtick gets numbing, but it is impossible to fault Stahelski's attention to detail -- which was the last action movie you saw in which shooters had to reload their weapons?|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 will make any action film fan feel a sense of nostalgia for that 1990s action death cinema. Everything is balls-to-the-wall, in-your-face, non-stop action that will leave you begging for more.|Fresh
One-ups the original in almost every way while retaining the original's scrappy spirit & surprising wit - a rare sequel that expands its universe while keeping its new thrills and twists in step with the themes that allowed so much fun the first time.|Fresh
It's all relatively loopy and there isn't a bone of rationality to be found within, but there's plenty of action and, when done right, you don't really need much else, right?|Fresh
Keanu Reeves is at his best when playing a mysterious man of few words. Plus the action scenes are almost believable as he is constantly reloading his weapons.|Fresh
Reeves, still fearsomely agile and adroitly deadpan at 52, is a perfect fit for the material: adorned in cleverness, yet ultimately basically very simple.|Fresh
It works for the simple reason that the characters take the rules of their world seriously, even if we find them preposterous.|Fresh
Part rehash of the first film, part expansion of its bizarro universe, it treats its plot like a trifle, serving little more than to thread together some indecently entertaining action.|Fresh
"The violence escalates: alongside the filmmakers' insistent world building, every splay of limb and brandish of weapon is acrobatic and emblematic, ""gun-fu,"" as the makers jokingly dubbed their masterful centripetal urgency."|Fresh
A fun, frenetic action picture.|Fresh
John Wick is back! Bloodier, deadlier, and more awesome than ever! John Wick: Chapter 2 nearly doubles the kill count the first film had and its white knuckled, fast-paced action knows how to dropkick your adrenaline into overdrive.|Fresh
The Raid movies make the John Wick films look like outtakes from Driving Miss Daisy by comparison. But NRA members are best advised not to leave the K-Y at home.|Rotten
John Wick: Chapter 2 works well by letting the audience laugh at such excesses, reminding us that there is a fine line between a punch and a punchline.|Fresh
If Kolstad and Stahelski repeat themselves on a couple of occasions, they make up for it by setting the mayhem in stylized environments.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 is one righteous MOFO of a movie.|Fresh
To give Stahelski due credit, he brings an undeniable artistic flair to the action movie, as co-director of the 2014 hit John Wick, and as the solo director of this stylish sequel, which picks up where the first one left off.|Fresh
Director Stahelski cements his status as an audaciously talented newcomer worth keeping an eye on, and whatever he decides to do next rest assured I'll be first in line to give it a look.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 is an enjoyable enough expansion on the first film. But its final-act setup for John Wick: Chapter 3 is more trying than promising.|Fresh
The action scenes are as mesmerizing as ever, providing the same satisfaction as watching an expert chef or artist at work.|Fresh
...will make even the most hardened action fan wince.|Fresh
The John Wick movies capture, better than any other action movies, the peculiar feeling of being an American in the 21st century: blessed with immense power but always kinda bummed out about it.|Fresh
"The many long, exhausting fight scenes in ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" are captured in sustained takes and vivid backgrounds unique to the personality of each scene."|Fresh
While I confess that I'd like to see Wick diversify his tactics beyond dropping opponents in armbars and shooting them in the ribcage or head repeatedly, I cannot deny that it's satisfying every time.|Fresh
This outlandish and violent series is at its best when its fight scenes are both savage and inventive.|Fresh
Was I the only critic to praise John Wick? JW2 is more of the same, different dog.|Fresh
Assassin action sequel is thrilling but very bloody.|Fresh
John Wick 2 may not be as wickedly fun as the first iteration, but what it lacks in freshness is made up for in an increase in scope, all without losing its moxie.|Fresh
There is little in this film apart from Reeves graphically shooting one person after another in the head for 2 hours. It's disgraceful that Hollywood keeps foisting movies that have no other purpose than to desensitize people to bestial brutality.|Rotten
This week's guilty pleasure.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 delivers plenty more of what fans want, while fleshing out the property's mythology and lore in fascinating ways.|Fresh
If the outline is more ordinary, the movie still scores big with its not-quite-real world.|Fresh
Miss those brawny action movies of the '80s? Here's why John Wick: Chapter 2 would fit right in with films with Stallone, Schwarzenegger and co.|Fresh
By the time the end credits roll, the toughest choice was wanting to see it again or start counting down for Chapter 3.|Fresh
John Wick's world is dangerous and not one you'd really even want to visit, but it sure is fun to observe from the relative safety of a darkened theater.|Fresh
There are some amazing action scenes...But by upping the mayhem, punches, kicks, gunshots and, ultimately, the body count, the film starts to lose some of its punch. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
There's more detail about Wick's secret world here, more pulp fun. Maybe more dead bodies, too, but who can keep track of that?|Fresh
John Wick 2 is old money for a new generation. An explosive, well-organized action movie. We no longer need James Bond. Our new dressed to kill cinematic savior is John Wick.|Fresh
It's hard to be subjective, but I rate it four snapped necks, three pencils in the head, two slashed forearm arteries in a big Roman thermae and one dagger to the aorta, if that helps.|Fresh
A worthy sequel to the best American action film of the 2010s.|Fresh
You would not expect a sequel to a Keanu Reeves shoot-em-up to be one of the more engrossing and beautiful films of the year, but hey, it's 2017 - there have been a lot of surprises.|Fresh
revisits all those elements that were so very right in the first film, and ... amps up into another violent flight of fancy replete with exquisitely choreographed mayhem and a suitably black sense of humor.|Fresh
The stunt settings are imaginative, including ancient Roman catacombs and an art installation that is like a super-sized funhouse mirror display.|Fresh
John Wick 2 continues to prove that Stahelski's series is a superior big-screen killing machine. Bring on Chapter 3.|Fresh
Here's the problem with avenging angels: after a while, their invincibility gets both boring and silly, and the viewer starts pining for something recognizably human.|Rotten
"In the wrong hands, this type of thing could be a drag, but ""John Wick 2"" is one of the most fun action pictures in recent memory."|Fresh
A symphony of violence, a ballet even, and the visuals are abstracted to the surreal.|Fresh
Dragged down only slightly by a lack of resolution and less of the original's aura of hushed mystery, John Wick: Chapter 2 nonetheless delivers everything most fans could want.|Fresh
For better or worse -- though mostly for better -- it's a full-scale assault on the senses, constantly pushing itself to greater feats of excess.|Fresh
Holding the torch passed from '80s and '90s John Woo classics, director Chad Stahelski delivers an epic ballet of arm-breaking and gun-kata that somehow manages to run for 122 minutes without ever overstaying its welcome. That's far easier said than done.|Fresh
A twisted Wick continues to burn bright!|Fresh
doesn't even work as a shallow distraction|Rotten
The second chapter isn't quite as out-of-the-blue invigorating as the original, but I'm still primed for the next chapter.|Fresh
Who would have guessed Keanu Reeves' stoic, black-clad, one-man killing machine would become THE go-to bad guy/action hero of the 2010s?|Fresh
'John Wick: Chapter 2' is wickedly entertaining.|Fresh
Even more entertaining the second time around.|Fresh
You might think you're watching the face-shooting revenge flick Frederico Fellini never got to make.|Fresh
Its protagonist and story may not have changed much, but [director Chad] Stahelski has more than a few new tricks up his sleeve.|Fresh
For those who are in it for non-stop car chases, explosions, gunplay and jujutsu, it's an all-you-can-swallow buffet.|Fresh
Stahelski has burst out as a vivid and creative action director with these two John Wick films. He has a true talent for making Reeves and everyone else - and everything - pop and look good.|Fresh
"The lightness and winking quality that softened the slaughter are less evident in ""John Wick: Chapter 2,"" an altogether more solemn affair weighed down by the philosophy that more is always more."|Rotten
Old fashioned values and New World nihilism makes John Wick: Chapter 2 such an irresistible adrenaline fix.|Fresh
"Your reaction to John Wick: Chapter 2 will depend on whether you find that sort of ""why are you hitting yourself?"" thing funny or not-and how many times in a row you find it funny."|Rotten
By doubling down on its idiosyncrasies, Chapter 2 justifies the existence of more Wick without overstaying its welcome. It's a lesson most Hollywood sequels could stand to learn.|Fresh
"Both John Wick films are sendups of the tasteless excess of B-action pics and all-out celebrations of their vulgarity. Chapter 2 is the best one could hope for in an action sequel, and it doesn't even have the ""killed the puppy"" gimmick on its side."|Fresh
This is pure entertainment that is entertaining because Reeves plays the character with never wavering sincerity.|Fresh
A thoroughly brainless orgy of fights, shoot-outs, foot pursuits and car chases that should dazzle fans of such fare while leaving anyone who'd like a bit of steak to go with the sizzle cold.|Rotten
"Action junkies are going to love this...With Keanu Reeves judoing, jiu-jitsuing, car-fuing and pencil gouging his way through a 141 body count, ""John Wick: Chapter Two"" is 120 minutes of mayhem in a game gone global."|Fresh
The fringe details save the project from degenerating into homicidal overkill.|Fresh
"There is so much beautiful, beautiful killing in ""John Wick: Chapter 2,"" you can hardly blame the movie for refusing to look away."|Fresh
"The first ""John Wick"" was taut and nasty, a potent slug of B-movie. This one is so enamored of its own extravagance that, on more than one occasion, I was reminded of ""Zoolander 2."""|Rotten
Not since the John Woo-inspired Lethal Weapon have fight segments so delightfully surprised us with their lyrical movement, raw force and explosive spontaneity, all supplemented by Oscar-grade sound editing and mixing.|Fresh
"The movie provides an adrenaline rush that will keep action junkies high for weeks. A few times, the feature does slow down to allow you to take a breath; then, it accelerates as Wick takes on hordes ... who expire as quickly as ""Star Trek"" red shirts."|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter Two demonstrates what film as an art form is all about: it awes and delights, challenges and provokes.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 does have its moments. But far too few of them. A little judicious pruning in the action scenes would make for a far more entertaining film that might appeal beyond the 15-year-old-boy demographic.|Rotten
This is pathetic. What kind of person is this?|Rotten
Chapter 2 is a hyper-violent piece of pulp action cinema through and through, but it's also an exemplar of how to make such a film with style and intelligence.|Fresh
'John Wick: Chapter 2' shows there's a lot of life left for the character who deals out nothing but death.|Fresh
"Reeves is thoroughly persuasive as a killer who takes pride in his expertise. The role he began with 2014's ""John Wick"" is tailor-made for his laconic acting style."|Fresh
"It isn't easy to explain the appeal of the ""John Wick"" movies, and they are inarguably not for every taste, but there is a purity to them that transcends their barbarity and has something to do with the central character."|Fresh
The pleasures of John Wick: Chapter 2 may be even greater than those of its predecessor-itself a symphonic achievement in scrappy, balls-out, action filmmaking ...|Fresh
It's just as ridiculously entertaining, an orgy of balletic violence that isn't for everyone, but has its own twisted beauty.|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 doubles down on everything that made the first movie so enjoyable ... resulting in the rare sequel that's bigger and better as well.|Fresh
"""Chapter 2"" maintains the delicious vibration of the original film."|Fresh
John Wick: Chapter 2 will have you salivating to know what happens next to the world's most lethal killer.|Fresh
Easily enjoyed as a film in which man-bunned mopes are mowed down - joyfully apolitical, free of social subtext. Yet it's tacky & distinguished, luxuriating in literary allusions & bodacious lacerations like someone chasing a 10-year scotch with PBR.|Fresh
"It might not be ""Matrix"" territory, exactly, but with ""John Wick: Chapter 2,"" genre fans finally get the sort of expanded Keanuverse they were craving."|Fresh
An entertaining, ultraviolent and occasionally witty thriller.|Fresh
The semiretired superassassin killed 77 adversaries last time around. The numbers are similar here.|Rotten
"I'll say this for ""John Wick: Chapter 2"": It sure does deliver the bang for the moviegoer's bucks."|Fresh
In addition to an ever-expanding lineup of guest stars, the movie builds a terrific running joke about the way New Yorkers will ignore literally anything that happens around them if it means getting to work on time.|Fresh
