It mightn't be exciting enough for some viewers, but Hanks is a big presence and carries this one home with great skill and composure.|Fresh

Sully is a skilfully made reconstruction of a recent real-life feat of heroic professionalism. But narrative tension is sorely lacking.|Fresh
Sully is a beautifully captured tale of bravery, human spirit and is a poignant reflection on how one man can restore some of your faith in humanity. It's exactly the kind of movie America needs right now.|Fresh

Tom Hanks seems comfortable in the role, moustache and all.|Fresh
Eastwood remains an American master, and if some of the finer details lack finesse, such quibbles are subsumed by the overall emotional whomp.|Fresh
This is pretty much the truth of New Yorkers' feelings about the landing on the Hudson -- and Eastwood brings them back with a crisp, unmannered efficiency of which few other moviemakers are capable.|Fresh
With clear barriers between institutions of authority and the citizens they have sworn to serve and protect, Sully is a film that shows how the system can work when the right time comes.|Fresh
Several television shows and documentaries have already been made which chronicle US Airways Flight 1549 and they offer more insight than this cheesy, fictionalised version.|Rotten

Sully may be just want the mass audience wants in the 21st century: a disaster film with a happy ending.|Fresh
"Instead of mending fences in Sully, Eastwood works through both awe and disbelief, recognizing underappreciated professionalism...by looking back at ""the miracle on the Hudson"" with a sobering, unsentimental sense of recent history."|Fresh
With good work from Linney (in a slightly thankless part), Aaron Eckhart as First Officer Jeff Skiles and a large cast in small roles as passengers, this is still mostly about Hanks' fine, subtle performance, which dominates the proceedings.|Fresh
This isn't Eastwood's best film, and it doesn't completely succeed in translating the true story to the big screen. But it's not without moments of spine-tingling movie magic.|Fresh
Clint Eastwood can't land this overblown mess.|Rotten
It is a professional's tribute to professionalism, and as with any job well done, there's love in it.|Fresh
With a white-haired Hanks on rock-solid form, it's a finely etched portrait of an ultra-modest hero.|Fresh
Sully is a film made by a pro's pro about a pro's pro.|Fresh
I can imagine all of the good impulses that went into the decision to make Sully, but none of that matters when the film is as resolutely limp as this one.|Rotten
Though Sully is by no means Eastwood's worst film -- I reserve that honor for 2002's Blood Work -- it does achieve the impossible. It makes an unlikeable film out of one of the few feel-good stories of the aughts.|Rotten
...would work better as a video exhibit at an aviation history museum than it does as a dramatic narrative.|Rotten
It's impressive that Eastwood, at age 86, has managed to become more lively and humane a director. But his politics may be unduly coloring his films, and it's becoming distracting.|Rotten
A typically sturdy, no-nonsense directorial effort from Clint Eastwood, who crafts the film with his a stylistic juxtaposition of visual simplicity and sobering emotional complexity.|Fresh
A commendable achievement that offers a fuller and more three-dimensional look at the heroic pilot than we've seen before.|Fresh
"Centuries from now, should movies still be being made, film historians will still be talking about Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood...if you want to introduce your little one to a true hero, introduce them to ""Sully."""|Fresh
This is a quietly powerful story about the importance of mastering, rather than surrendering to, machines.|Fresh
Sully isn't a new career peak for Eastwood and probably won't be mentioned on any year-end lists, but it shows Eastwood can find a sweet-spot between musings of modern life and effective character study.|Fresh
As cold as the Hudson River in January.|Rotten
When the movie gets around to actually depicting the incident itself, fragmented though it is, it is a visual tour de force, with convincing images of the aircraft, trailing smoke, gliding through the sky, not far enough above New York City.|Fresh
Hanks' measured performance of an honest, humble everyman who was simply doing the best he could under extreme circumstances, elevates the entire experience|Fresh
Like his past unassuming-hero roles, Tom Hanks is born to play Sully.|Fresh
Hanks delivers a grounded performance in service of a man whose heroism took flight at the right moment.|Fresh
Though at times lacking action, it still is a well-conceived film that justly serves as a moving tribute to its low-key hero.|Fresh
Neither Eastwood's controversial politics nor his worst storytelling instincts could really mess up Sully.|Fresh
This is exactly the type of historical dramatization that Hollywood loves to churn out, but Sully doesn't feel like merely a paycheck. Like much of latter-day Eastwood's work, this is another flawed but thoughtful effort.|Fresh
Despite its excellent lead performance from Tom Hanks, it also feels like a thematically safe and unadventurous entry from one of the industry's heavyweight filmmakers.|Fresh
Sully amounts to a respectable yet unmemorable account of real-life heroism, despite fine performances and capable direction.|Fresh
Tom Hanks has enough emotional charisma to keep Clint Eastwood's hero conventions in the air, but this cinematic salute to Chesley Sullenberger's heroism loses thrust.|Fresh
A mishmash of genres -- a would-be disaster flick, a legal thriller, a heroic biopic -- jarringly cut together with the thinnest of threads linking them together.|Rotten
Despite a soporific first 30 minutes that is almost deadly, when director Eastwood finally gets to the landing on the Hudson and the subsequent hearing the film is so good that it overcomes the first third, but why did Hanks hide Sully's smile?|Fresh
Clint Eastwood still has surprises in him.|Fresh
Tom Hanks is as solid as ever in the role of Sullenberger, a stoic who is trying to hold it together under immense pressure -- from without and within. But... the character, while earning our respect, is a little hard to warm to.|Fresh
The crash is the real star of the show. Well, OK, so is Mr. Hanks in an excellent performance as the self-effacing title character.|Fresh
Both an admiring recreation of the Miracle on the Hudson and a poignant reflection on how an ordinary, yet supremely competent man declines to exalt himself as a hero.|Fresh
Near the end, as we watch aviation re-enactors simulate the cockpit conditions under which Sully was operating, even these relatively humdrum moments have their own white-knuckle tension.|Fresh
Eastwood's plain and to-the-point filmmaking style syncs perfectly with Hanks's marvellously underplayed and understated characterisation.|Fresh
"Eastwood's decision to focus on the ""yes-but"" questions is wise, giving the film, if not a life-or-death narrative arc, a more relatable tension."|Fresh
Clint Eastwood's latest outing is easily the most streamlined and economical motion picture of the acclaimed actor-turned-director's Oscar-winning career.|Fresh
The film is attentive to the iconic power of that event, both in itself and in connection with the last time the world watched as an airliner went down against the New York skyline.|Fresh
hinges on the superiority of experience over theory, a soothing message in a mechanized world that relegates the human factor to a slot just this side of superfluous, but one that needed the kind of subtlety that Hanks delivers in his performance.|Fresh
... a vivid and intimate glimpse into the buildup and aftermath of the crash, both inside and outside the cockpit.|Fresh
Eastwood ignores the crash for the man behind it in a quiet paean to middle class professionalism.|Fresh
Hanks is very good at playing an Everyman, and Eastwood is content to showcase Sullenberger in that way.|Fresh
It moves from beginning to end as a tightly piloted flight that proves fact trumps fiction in matters of the soul and the sky.|Fresh
Eastwood handles all of this with his customary relaxed skill.|Fresh
Great performances in tense, quietly powerful true story.|Fresh
"A movie about the ""Can Do"" qualities of America is direly needed right now. ""Sully"" is that movie."|Fresh
Hanks is our Jimmy Stewart; that calm, collected presence on the big screen who seems so relatable, he gives us permission to dare to put ourselves in his position and ask the anxious question 'What would I do in that situation?'|Fresh
Sully is much more compelling than a regurgitation of everything you saw on the news.|Fresh
As Sully, Hanks is perfectly cast. It's a well-crafted, understated performance as a man who's haunted by the incident, cool and calm under pressure and uncomfortable in the role of hero.|Fresh
A film that's more vital, intense, thoughtful and emotional than any 2016 movie by filmmakers less than half [Eastwood's] age.|Fresh
"It's nice to have a movie like Sully come around every once in a while. Director Clint Eastwood's re-creation of 2009's ""Miracle on the Hudson"" is the kind of story that will restore some of your faith in humanity."|Fresh

Hanks does an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while his reputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a cast that includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn as his surly inquisitors.|Fresh
Thrilling when we're on and around the plane (seeing that giant CGI bird splash down, especially on an Imax screen, makes you realize how improbable the whole enterprise was) and too often thudding when we're not.|Rotten
"""Sully"" isn't interested in going anywhere new. Watching the movie, you can feel Eastwood hurrying up to finish to move on to his next thing."|Rotten
Tom Hanks's haunted, evocative performance elevates the rigidly black-and-white Sully to a level of humanity that is life-affirming.|Fresh
Although not an Oscar-worthy endeavor, Sully proves to be by turns engaging, exhilarating, and nail-biting.|Fresh
Tom Hanks is the perfect choice to play the unflappable Sully, given that he is the Patron Saint of Quiet Calm and Confidence in Crisis.|Fresh
Kudos to the team of Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks for successfully conveying the enviable amalgam of guts, smarts and stoicism exhibited by level-headed Captain Sullenberger in the face of impending demise.|Fresh
'Sully' is a nice little film about a hugely remarkable achievement.|Fresh
Spare a thought for poor Laura Linney, whose only co-star in this film is a landline telephone. But Tom Hanks? He's the real American hero - even in the movies.|Fresh
It's an Eastwood film that very nearly strikes the same unsophisticated but delicate tone of his obligatory end-credits ditty.|Rotten
It would take a far better filmmaker (and maybe an actual wizard) to wring suspense, tension, or fear out of a perilous situation whose outcome - whose happy, casualty-free outcome - has already been reported.|Rotten
Normally I like succinct but Clint Eastwood's 95 minute story of the miracle on the Hudson -- while a great movie -- jets through material that demands a bit more detail.|Fresh
Most compelling, is how in a rare moment of collective solidarity, rapidly assembled crews spontaneously came together to save everyone. And that's quite an unusual sighting in a movie these days, with the deepening divisive climate in society right now.|Fresh
"""Sully"" - A Tale of Modest Heroism"|Fresh
The soul of the film resides in Hanks' flawlessly tuned performance.|Fresh
It's a movie with problems, but it also leaves you feeling somewhat inspired, and reminds you that sometimes, still, people can come together and make the world a slightly better place.|Fresh
Sully is freighted with the heaviness of memory, both personal and collective, on screen and off.|Fresh
Eastwood's leanest and most personal movie since Gran Torino.|Fresh
Eastwood moves slowly to the landing but gives it its full due. Filmed on IMAX, his big, clear images nevertheless remain somber -- as does Eastwood's own quiet score - in the big, awaited moment.|Fresh
There are shockingly few scenes that manage to add to the story in a meaningful way, and it results in more drag than a plane taking off with its flaps up.|Rotten
Nothing here is overwrought. The real-life drama is real enough.|Fresh
Sully won't just please crowds and evoke tears but, in an angry, ugly time in our national history, it should also resonate deeply with many.|Fresh
Sully remains an impressive achievement, a portrait of a good man whose heroism lay in having the right stuff and knowing how to use it during a small eternity of looming chaos and unprecedented peril.|Fresh
Simple but laser-focused, and it's hard not to read Eastwood's interest as autobiographical, given his reputation as a no-nonsense professional who runs his movie sets without tantrums or budget overruns.|Fresh
Taut and vivid.|Fresh

It's intelligent and absorbing, but keep those expectations modest.|Fresh
"Faithfully recaptures the events of the ""Miracle on the Hudson."""|Fresh
Tom Hanks turns in a beautifully restrained performance in Sully, but despite some memorable sequences, the plodding script feels padded even at barely over 90 minutes.|Rotten
Sully is a reminder about the miracle that consummate professionals can be in the world. And its filmmaker is the oldest and most prolific exemplary professional our movies have had in the modern era.|Fresh
That it unnerves you as much as it does may seem surprising, given that going in, we know how this story ends. But Mr. Eastwood is also very good at his job, a talent that gives the movie its tension along with an autobiographical sheen.|Fresh
"Sully is another testament to just how deft a filmmaker Eastwood is because it's easy to tell the ""true"" story of a hero, but it's hard to tell the true story of a man."|Fresh
"""Sully"" offers a large-scale air near-disaster, but the real draw here is the star turn, with Hanks shaping an interior life to Sully that's as powerful as any plane crash imagery."|Fresh
'Sully' deserves to fly high on the radar during the awards season.|Fresh
It may not be a classic, but it is enormously crowd-pleasing for the story and its reminder that ordinary people can do extraordinary things in a crisis.|Fresh
[T]rapped in an unfortunate middle ground between examining the toll of the incident ... and simply presenting the incident from the perspective of objective history.|Rotten
Sully is a feel-good look at the surreality of instant fame and what it takes to keep it from changing you.|Fresh
It just might be the first plane-crash movie that suggests itself as suitable in-flight entertainment too.|Fresh
Clocking in at just over 90 minutes, Sully is a no-frills, low-thrills tale of heroism that quietly draws the right levels of admiration and inspiration from the viewer.|Fresh
Even with its mistakes, Sully is watchable and occasionally gripping entertainment.|Fresh
Sully is a character study that doesn't tell us much about the character. Other than the fact that he is a hero. Which we already knew.|Rotten
The writing, acting and direction all combine for a satisfying real-life-hero, ripped-from-the-headlines story that was well worth telling.|Fresh
"Tom Hanks was born to play ""Sully."""|Fresh
"Eastwood keeps his direction lean and mean. There's not an ounce of wasted screen time in Sully's 96 minutes, but the story, an example of ""truth is stranger than fiction,"" has all the thrust it needs, and then some."|Fresh
[Hanks] is predictably great, especially in a scene where he's informed that all his passengers survived, but it's a quiet, dignified performance, the kind that has lately become his stock-in-trade.|Fresh
Tom Hanks suffers and is scared.|Rotten
Remember how CNN ran this story into the ground, as it were? Eastwood does that here, draining whatever suspense that remains in a story for which we know the happy ending.|Rotten
The only real reason we care about Sully is what happened in that plane. In that regard, and only that regard, Sully absolutely delivers.|Fresh
The movie is more than worth seeing ...|Fresh
It could be argued that the very plainness of the picture, anchored by a predictably solid but unflashy performance by Tom Hanks, is the appropriate way of celebrating a man who saw himself not as a hero but simply a fellow doing his job as best he can.|Fresh
"Clint Eastwood is simply the ideal director for a big-screen telling of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" hero pilot story that Sully delivers with confidence and grace."|Fresh
"""Sully"" is a classy, enormously satisfying ode to simple competence. To paraphrase the title character, it's just a movie doing its job. And amen to that."|Fresh
"""Sully"" is the kind of film that may be described as old-fashioned and never goes out of style."|Fresh
"Screenwriter Todd Komarnicki (""Perfect Stranger"") has taken a simple approach in adapting Sullenberger's book, perhaps too simple...See it for Eastwood's classical direction and Hanks' thoughtful reconstruction of an American hero."|Fresh
At once a true-life drama about heroism and people working in harmony under exceptional conditions ...|Fresh
It basks in the rightness of those who work hard to get a proper result, simultaneously disinterested in reinventing the wheel and still finding some new ways to spin it.|Fresh
"Clint Eastwood's adaptation of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" isn't quite as riveting as hoped. Sully is fairly acted by the players, but runs short with a few scenes that come off as contrived."|Fresh
For as conventional and safe as Eastwood plays the human drama ... the movie's gripping reenactment of the crash is a wonderfully staged piece of filmmaking that makes it all worth it.|Fresh
"""One of the best movies of 2016."""|Fresh
Like Sully, Hanks makes the impossible seem effortless. Listen up, Oscar. Hanks and director Eastwood deserve the three words Sully prizes most: Job well done.|Fresh
"A man doing his job, a guy flying a plane, a pilot controlling the stick. 'Sully' shows just how important one ""ordinary"" person can be, when ordinary circumstances suddenly, unprecedentedly, become extraordinary."|Fresh
The event itself remains a stunner, but Clint Eastwood's somewhat drab drama sheds no new light on the media-shy pilot.|Rotten
Whether you want to accept it or not, Eastwood remains one of the best and most quixotic filmmakers we have, torn between jingoism and doubt, exceptionalism and despair.|Fresh
"An unusually good director can make us feel anxious while watching a story we expected to have no drama at all, and Clint Eastwood does that in the low-key, beautifully assembled ""Sully."""|Fresh
...the movie often fares much better than one might've anticipated...|Fresh
Eastwood and Hanks back to doing what they do best: understated Everyman heroism in a gripping yet heartwarming piece of cinema.|Fresh
Stretching those 208 seconds into 96 minutes proves difficult.|Rotten
The closest [Sully] gets to 'emotive' is a brief welling-of-the-eyes at the hospital, after hearing that all of his passengers survived. It's a reminder that Tom Hanks does his best work while being treated for trauma.|Fresh
That Eastwood is able to tell a story so big in a tight 96-minute package and do it so effortlessly is a true achievement.|Fresh
One of the most well-crafted, tightly constructed screenplays of the year.|Fresh
Sully is a meaningless, toothless waste of 96 minutes.|Rotten
It's only appropriate that the film is as competent, efficient, and mildly dull as the people it celebrates.|Fresh
Clint Eastwood directs a picture about a topic he loves dearly: Age and guts beats youth and technology every time.|Fresh
"Inevitable is how ""Sully"" feels. That, and a little soggy."|Rotten
Sullenberger is, fundamentally, not that interesting of a protagonist. He's so heroic, so evidently in the right in terms of his actions, that his struggles don't resonate.|Rotten
Sully wants to be life-affirming Oscar bait, but it's more like Clint Eastwood's Book Club For Dads Who Shop In Cargo Pants At Costco.|Rotten
Eastwood, at 86, continues to be a marvel, and this stands as one of the four-time Oscar winner's best films.|Fresh
"True story of ""The Miracle on the Hudson"" Exhilarating, Moving and Well Done"|Fresh
"Weaving an enthralling tale hidden behind the one everyone read about in the press, ""Sully"" is a stirring entertainment, persuasively told."|Fresh
"In the end, ""Sully"" is a broadly crowd-pleasing movie, at a time when we could use the straight-forward entertainment."|Fresh
There is something compelling about someone who simply shows up for the job, day after day, carving out the remarkable from the unremarkable.|Fresh
"A movie that unlocks other Eastwood movies, showing them all to be nuanced studies of tormented masculinity - yes, even ""American Sniper."""|Fresh
The so-called 'untold story' is essentially nonsense...The struggle is real for screenwriter Todd Komarnicki...|Rotten
Tense and exciting - as Clint Eastwood, once again, proves he's a superb storyteller...|Fresh
The second act is worth the price of even the most expensive IMAX ticket.|Fresh
Hanks pulls off the earnest optimism and unassuming humility that made Sullenberger a media darling right after the incident.|Fresh
Sully could have very easily been a film about a tragic plane crash, and Eastwood invites audiences to simply stop and consider the miracle for a while longer.|Fresh
A celebration of everyday valor.|Fresh
A celebration of stoic professionalism -- Sully's, stewardesses', first responder's, and Eastwood's.|Fresh
Some viewers may find the film too predictable and TV-movie-like. Instead, this reviewer found it fascinating, gripping and worthy of the legacy of an American hero.|Fresh
[A] plainspoken and disarmingly delicate conception of heroics, which might be Eastwood's best work since Million Dollar Baby.|Fresh
If Tom Hanks hadn't existed to play the title role, Eastwood would have had to invent him: This is one of those cases where movie-star persona and real-life legend blend perfectly.|Fresh
There's a good idea for a movie here. In fact, there are two. But the movie itself never quite takes off.|Rotten
Clint Eastwood + Tom Hanks + Sully = one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
The fact that Clint Eastwood continues to turn out such strong, impassioned, relevant, and entertaining work in his twilight years is nothing less than staggering.|Fresh
Clint Eastwood's heart pounding recreation of the Miracle on the Hudson is only one of the rewards of this earnest, slyly emotional biography.|Fresh
"Good people doing their jobs thoughtfully and at the height of their abilities, working together under unprecedented and extraordinary circumstances. Sometimes all of those things come together to create a miracle, and ""Sully"" is a warm reminder of that."|Fresh
Watching that airplane land on the Hudson River is a heart-stopping wonder. But the entire ordeal lasted just 208 seconds. The movie is 96 minutes.|Rotten
Sully would make a great 35-minute movie|Fresh
At its heart, this is a thrilling tribute to a modest hero who rose to an extraordinary occasion.|Fresh
Vivid, riveting story of Capt. Chesley Sullenberger marks another milestone for director Clint Eastwood.|Fresh
Offers a thrilling ride but crashes in the end.|Rotten
Sometimes incredible true stories don't make for incredible films.|Rotten
"An unabashed salute to real-life heroism, Clint Eastwood's drama rivetingly recreates the Miracle on the Hudson. Though not always as confident outside of the cockpit, ""Sully"" mostly earns its crowd-pleasing, lump-in-your-throat sentiment."|Fresh
Even as recently as American Sniper, Eastwood has done a much better job than this of shading in the grays of what constitutes heroism, both during and after the fact. Sully is so square, it's a wonder it even gets airborne.|Fresh
At its best, 'Sully' is a middle ground portrait of an American hero without any deep insight. At its worst, it's an unsalvageable mess.|Rotten
An unabashed crowdpleaser about a hero fighting to maintain that title when corporate greed threatens to tarnish his image.|Fresh
It's an effectively thrilling story of quietly unassuming, can-do American heroism-the kind, sadly, we don't get to witness much these days.|Fresh
This is Hanks' show, and he delivers a typically strong performance, quickly allowing us to forget that we're watching an actor.|Fresh
Sully proves that with the proper material and actors Clint Eastwood can still stir emotions with the best of them.|Fresh
Eastwood delivers an earnest, straightforward look at the way the captain's professionalism saved the day. But while that aspect of the movie hits more than a few obvious notes, the crash is the real star of the show.|Fresh
There's a lively, hard-to-ignore subtext here, wherein an 86-year-old classicist filmmaker tells the story of an experienced captain, still alive because of his confident human instincts, under threat by an industry's over-reliance on computer simulation.|Fresh
