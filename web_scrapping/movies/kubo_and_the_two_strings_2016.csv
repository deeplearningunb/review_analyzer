Kubo and the Two Strings is not a film that any other Western animation studio would ever dream of creating. The deeply philosophical tale told here is far closer to Studio Ghibli than anything Pixar would be able to come up with.|Fresh
The point here is to savor the intricately animated action sequences and to drink in the potent mood of the piece, which brings a kinetic edge to Laika's signature detail-heavy, slightly melancholy production design|Fresh

Kubo and the Two Strings is a visually dazzling film set in an ancient, magical Japan. And now, the bad news. As a narrative, Kubo and the Two Strings is nearly incomprehensible.|Rotten
It flows like a dream, and if it slightly overreaches in its last movement, well, I'd rather see a film stumble because it tried to juggle too many ideas rather than get by with too few.|Fresh
Every frame of Kubo and the Two Strings is majestic. Every emotional beat resounds. Every heart string is played with tenderness and jubilation, by masters of an old art made new again.|Fresh

Kubo and the Two Strings is better than immersive -- it's absorptive. We're pulled in Knight's direction; we become part of his studio's technical wizardry.|Fresh
First-time director Travis Knight, who was the lead animator on Laika's previous three films, presents the story with a beautifully fluid style.|Fresh
It is an epic inspired by the tradition of Kurosawa and Lean, mixed with more than a bit of the fantasy of The Wizard of Oz.|Fresh
Impressive stop-motion animation, a fun voice cast, and a story that will draw in people, but a slow pace and dreamy tone may lull audiences to sleep.|Fresh
Much as the small fry will enjoy this, there's even more that you'll love.|Fresh
...the most original creation from an American studio that you will have seen in the past five years.|Fresh
Laika President, CEO and lead animator Travis Knight makes his directorial debut leaning on his visual talent with a lumpy original Japanese folk lore-inspired story from Shannon Tindle and Marc Haimes that lacks emotional resonance.|Rotten
So while the movie is a visual feast, just as you'd expect, its story is nonetheless fairly predictable fantasy-quest fare|Fresh

Kubo is ultimately a joyful film -- a treat for the eyes and heart.|Fresh
"Fantastical and innovative, distinctively vivid and reflective, ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is destined to deepen and beautify all the more with subsequent viewings. It is an exciting prospect to see what Laika will dream up next."|Fresh
Kubo is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. If Laika continues to produce films of this quality, we'll have a worthy successor to the great Studio Ghibli.|Fresh
... lovely to behold, if viewers manage to keep their eyes open. It's an animated doozy and drowser at once, an uncomfortable mix of Miyazaki-style imagination and generic dullness. Snooze, and you don't necessarily lose.|Rotten
One of the best movies of the year...|Fresh
"Laika has made its second masterpiece, a film as artistic, challenging and scary as ""Coraline"""|Fresh

Be prepared to cry: it's rare that animation can stir up such deep emotion, but it'll happen, sometimes more than once.|Fresh
Kubo is a decidedly well-made film and one that pulled on ... my heartstrings ... a shame the voice talent couldn't have echoed the awe-inspiring diversity onscreen.|Fresh
A touching expression of loss, worth repeat viewings for its poetic visuals alone.|Fresh
Even if it has no interest in birthing a franchise, it deserves to live on as an instant classic.|Fresh
Laika Entertainment tackles fantasy in this stunning Japan-set fable.|Fresh
Kubo tells a rich, original, and compelling story which young people will eagerly follow and adults should equally enjoy.|Fresh
Laika has created here a genuinely enchanting fable of extraordinary artistic merit, and clearly respectfully enamoured of its subject matter.|Fresh

Older viewers will tune in to its melancholy - its battles between memory and loss, its themes of filial piety and betrayal - while younger ones will dig the more basic emotions of Kubo's epic journey.|Fresh
The impetus to tune out the movie's words only makes it easier to feast your eyes on its breathtaking images, which after a summer of underlit glop feel like a tall glass of cool water.|Fresh
I'm not inclined to give a pass to a family film that indoctrinates an irrational belief system just because it's novel.|Rotten
Kubo and the Two Strings may not pull off everything it wants to, but it is a proof of concept that somebody can -- and it provides some tremendous views along the way.|Fresh
Laika Studios are back in superb form with Kubo and the Two Strings, an eye-popping visual delight.|Fresh
Staggeringly beautiful and immensely true, this is the best animated film of 2016.|Fresh

It offers a powerful metaphor for the manner in which we carry the memories of our departed inside ourselves.|Fresh
This is Laika's brightest film to date, in both its dazzling colors and its core of irrepressible joy.|Fresh
