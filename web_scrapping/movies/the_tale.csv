The Tale is distressing and compelling, a film for the #MeToo movement that reckons with personal relationships and inflicted trauma.|Fresh
The framing of what happened to Jenny is flexible, expansive, interested in complication; the perspective is enigmatic, deeply personal, at once singular and manifold, insular and diffuse.|Fresh
Dern has never been better than she is here in this film. It's a stunning achievement, made all the more powerful by the fact that she's interpreting the filmmaker's worst moments in life.|Fresh
The Tale deeply understands and conveys the emotional cartwheels the mind does to victims as they reframe their narrative.|Fresh
The Sundance favorite brings a harrowing story out of the shadows.|Fresh
Fox's vulnerability, both in front of and behind the camera, shines through and leaves the viewer emotionally invested from the very beginning.|Fresh
While The Tale is a fictionalized version of Fox's story, it's not hard to believe a lot of conversations are recounted verbatim. Some things are unforgettable.|Fresh
I hope that The Tale helps a lot of the people who watch it: to heal, to grieve, to seek justice, to vent their fury.|Fresh
You feel the presence of the real Jennifer Fox because she's directing it, and it's her story...It's a really fascinating, very difficult-to-watch movie.|Fresh
For Fox, and for all of us, The Tale is a spot in time worth finding.|Fresh

A brave work of drama as testimonial.|Fresh
The television movie The Tale, is a far more nuanced, troubling and thought-provoking look at personal trauma.|Fresh
Many audiences will likely shy away from the graphic depiction of pedophilia and abuse, but the film's frankness is often its greatest asset.|Fresh
To me, it's a compelling true story about abuse told through the medium of film, with imperfect construction.|Fresh
Even viewed from the sofa, it makes an IMAX-sized impact.|Fresh
What makes Fox's film so remarkable is its ability to hold these contradictory ideas simultaneously without ever presenting their coexistence as a paradox.|Fresh
As harrowing as it is to watch, seeing a woman come to terms with the reality of her abuse after decades of burying it is deeply powerful.|Fresh
Dern is breathtaking as she grits her teeth and faces her fears, while Fox's courage and skill are hard to overstate.|Fresh
This is a timely and important film, told with honesty and dedication to examining the anguish and anger such terrible events leave in their wake.|Fresh
The Tale is an uncompromising self-portrait, a painful memoir of an artist battling her past. Laura Dern delivers the performance of her career.|Fresh
The Tale is the first film in a long time that shows the labor-intensive work of unpacking a trauma from the psyche.|Fresh
[The Tale] is an impressive, cohesive piece.|Fresh
Dern's performance grows more anguished as she relives this sordid history and confronts the aged Bill (the late John Heard) in an explosive climax that's as cathartic for her as for the viewer.|Fresh
Most of all it plays like an off-putting Lifetime movie, but with a better cast (Ellen Burstyn, Common, John Heard, Frances Conroy and Elisabeth Debicki).|Rotten
It would be great to see HBO screen The Tale in at least a few theaters, in hopes of making [Laura Dern] a longshot Oscar contender.|Fresh
Jennifer Fox's dramatization of her own childhood sexual abuse is a searing, necessary watch.|Fresh
"Ultimately, ""The Tale"" is a wrenching, heartfelt success."|Fresh
The Tale is not a wonderful story by any means but it's so beautifully crafted by Jennifer Fox with a career-best performance by actress Laura Dern.|Fresh
The most shocking, upsetting thing Fox has done is tell a story about the malleability of our memories.|Fresh
"Please do not call The Tale ""a #MeToo movie."" It's reductive. And this beautiful, gripping, disturbing film deserves to be looked at with as much nuance as it offers. It's not a damned hashtag-anything movie."|Fresh
In a performance that ranks among the best I've seen in any film (theatrical or otherwise) this decade, Laura Dern essentially stands in for Fox... a beautifully nuanced portrayal of a smart, accomplished, independent woman.|Fresh
"""The Tale"" is a push, then, to disseminate a hard truth - and by extension an argument for confronting the reality of abuse and abusers, no matter how painful that process might be. And it's effective. Frighteningly, unforgettably so."|Fresh
The Tale is above all a work of profound empathy, as a look inside someone's psyche would have to be.|Fresh
The film is one long interrogation, not only from Jennifer the character's standpoint, but from a directorial standpoint.|Fresh
Fox does well by her protagonists - both of them.|Fresh
Dern, not surprisingly, rises to the occasion as a woman questioning everything she knows. The power in her performance is in moments of quiet flux.|Fresh
"In this view, its overall story of innocent susceptibility, bogus fulfillment, latter day denial and hard-earned closure triumphs over what Bill does to Jenny in the name of ""love."""|Fresh
"Fox's directing and script are so purposeful and direct that it can be very hard to watch ""The Tale"" without having to look away."|Fresh
"It's a rare thing for a film to anatomize the complex processes of memory and healing as effectively as ""The Tale."""|Fresh
Survivors of childhood sexual abuse will likely find The Tale a difficult watch. But it's damn near necessary viewing in this age of collective trauma unveiled.|Fresh
The film feels like [Jennifer Fox is] taking us on a journey of self-exploration without a foregone conclusion, which makes the end result both satisfying and not satisfying, much like real life.|Fresh
Dern's mastery is so complete that it makes conversation about the actor's skill or the awards she'll likely win seem unworthy; her performance ignites the screen with increasing tension.|Fresh
Fox and Dern hope The Tale will empower more people to not only share their own experiences with sexual abuse, but speak up when they witness it happening to others.|Fresh
The film is, necessarily, shocking but Fox handles what must have been difficult emotional material for her in a cool and responsible way that makes the message she delivers all the more devastating.|Fresh
It's a bold, significant piece of work: an investigative thriller with a grave finale that stuns you into silence, then, hopefully, something more.|Fresh
If it sounds too tough to watch, it's really not. Fox handles the material gently, and gradually so it becomes possible to get comfortable with the specifics so we can talk about them.|Fresh
The Tale is a soul-excavating reckoning with the suppression of trauma and a testament to the courage required for a victim to confront the most damaging moments of their lives.|Fresh
It takes a remarkably assured artist to make all this work, and Fox is savvy about how she eases us into her complicated narrative.|Fresh
It is truly hard to imagine more effective tinder to ignite a conversation than The Tale.|Fresh
[Luara] Dern gives a powerhouse performance as a strong-willed woman who has to reexamine her life. Child actress Isabelle NÃ©lisse plays 13-year-old Jennifer with a maturity that's astounding to watch.|Fresh
This is an excellent, poignant, and amazing film that will stick with you. I can't stop thinking about it. It's a must-see, even though watching it is a very difficult thing to do.|Fresh
A sensitive, innovative, even beautiful feature that cuts right at the heart of the most difficult conversations we're having as a country.|Fresh
Brilliantly constructed and heartrendingly performed, The Tale feels as cathartic and cleansing as a primal scream.|Fresh
A film about memory: the way it distorts and omits, creating an imperfect record, sometimes to shelter us from the harsh reality of our pasts.|Fresh
Director Jennifer Fox is one of those women, and she tells her brave and heartrending true story in The Tale by using memory and documentary influences as narrative elements that play with the medium in ways that bolster this harrowing recollection.|Fresh
It would be impossible to list the myriad tenets of the conversation surrounding abuse and victimhood that the film explores. We wouldn't purport to answer any of those questions, and maybe the film doesn't intend to either.|Fresh
An immense, brave, and genuinely earth-shaking self-portrait that explores sexual assault with a degree of nuance and humility often missing from the current discourse.|Fresh
"[Jennifer] Fox has done something courageous and generous, offering up the complexities of her story, all her pain and growth, to, yes, say ""me too."" But also, maybe, to show others how they may assess and tend to the wounds of their own pasts."|Fresh
Now that audiences are opening their minds to these upsetting personal narratives, Fox's film is but the first in a new genre, and the beginning of a much-needed conversation.|Fresh
One of the singular aspects of Fox's script is that it honors the messiness of real-life events, even if that means the film itself sometimes feels messy.|Fresh
The director's willingness to tell her own story in such graphic detail is a startlingly brave act.|Fresh
The Tale is one of the bravest and smartest movies I've ever seen.|Fresh
I want more people to see The Tale because it's such an innovative, honest and important film. It is a landmark, and Laura Dern is absolutely extraordinary. But I know for certain I'll never watch it again.|Fresh
This is certainly not a film that everyone will be able to take, but it's rare to see a film that's this fearlessly confrontational and emotionally complex when it comes to the issues at play within it.|Fresh
