The story itself needs no embellishment to be riveting and Theodore Melfi's direction is straightforward and unflashy, enlivened by a powerful soul original soundtrack by Pharrell Williams that captures the period feel.|Fresh
Here's a compliment you don't get to give often: This movie is really good, and it didn't even need to be!|Fresh
It's a highly entertaining crowd-pleaser that brings these women to the forefront... These stories intersect in a seamless manner, with all three leads getting a chance to shine.|Fresh
It's a movie that reminds us that America is at its best when living up to the pluralistic standards that we as a nation all too often find elusive, but remains the benchmark by which we should strive.|Fresh
Hidden Figures tells a story of genuine heroes that has been shelved for far too long. It also serves as inspiration to a nation of little girls to never stop reaching for those stars.|Fresh
Hidden Figures shines a light on three real women who deserve great acknowledgement. The movie makes us want to learn more, which is a good thing, but it would be better if we felt better informed coming out of the theatre.|Fresh
[Janelle Monáe] is an irresistible, glittering diamond who effervesces even when she doesn't need to, and I sincerely hope her film offers double now that she's proven how insanely good she is as an actress.|Fresh

Through strong performances, sensitive direction and the strength of its source material, Hidden Figures transcends cliché to become a genuinely moving, inspirational tale of perseverance, strength and love.|Fresh
Director Theodore Melfi has harmoniously married the darkness of racism with feel-good values. Hidden Figures is suitable for all ages.|Fresh
While we know the outcome of the project, it is the journey these women travel that makes this such an engaging film.|Fresh
"""Hidden Figures"" is compelling, full of heart, and engaging. It's a transforming story that balances humor with drama. A must-see film that allows important themes to play out and is both heartwarming and motivational."|Fresh
An inspirational and relevant crowd-pleaser that dutifully respects its characters and their various struggles.|Fresh
... a rousing, powerful film that praises and celebrates Black women in a way that's far too uncommon in today's society. Good. They deserve it.|Fresh
The movie is beautiful to watch in part because of the tremendous work of cinematographer Mandy Walker, who captures a feeling of a time long gone. The music elevates the true story.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is the perfect balm. It offers an optimistic view of how great this country can be when we unite behind a common cause. And it's a fun space adventure to boot.|Fresh
The best parts of the movie are, in fact, the three main characters. Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae are each captivating by themselves. Combined, they're mesmerising. They interact naturally and they give the movie authenticity.|Fresh

Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe are what make this movie. They are the heart.|Fresh
As the first major release of 2017, it's a little early to call Hidden Figures the feel-good movie of the year, but let's at least hope it sets the tone.|Fresh
A more optimistic than pessimistic message. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Here, we right an historical wrong, looking back at the important ... contributions that a group of three African-American women made to our nation's space program.|Fresh
So important, while also just really entertaining and really enjoyable...you can't help but feel for these women.|Fresh
The ultimate value of Hidden Figures is couched in its ability to empower the viewer; it occasionally indulges in populist cinema's most frequent vice of uninhibited emotion but these moments, and our reactions, are always earned.|Fresh
"""Hidden Figures"" provides a positive image of women as science researchers who were able to balance their personal and professional lives to achieve success."|Fresh
"... ""Hidden Figures"" acquires a potent presence, even if it would be stretching things to say it's a great movie. Still, historically, socially and culturally it may be remembered after the year's better films have faded into the recesses of memory."|Fresh
It's the quiet fierceness the actresses bring to these roles that make the work compelling.|Fresh
Even though Hidden Figures is overstuffed with plot points and has way too much going on to properly flesh out in its roughly 2-hour running time, the film deserves praise for putting some unknown heroes into the limelight|Fresh
Most of this country's history - like most Hollywood movies - has been written by white men. 'Hidden Figures' is a great reminder of the unsung African-American women who contributed to all our accomplishments.|Fresh
Hidden Figures tells the amazing true story of three women who were pioneers in the space program.|Fresh
Happily, the government hires women for its space program. Otherwise, how would we get this remarkable film?|Fresh
As far as the viewer goes, the story dates back to the 60s, but when you catch the tributes paid to the the real Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson during the credit roll, you know that this story of triumph needed to be told, right here, right now.|Fresh
Directed by Theodore Melfi, this fascinating, hugely watchable and eventually heart-warming story does occasionally lack subtlety but it's deservedly up for a Best Picture Oscar.|Fresh
The pragmatism that flows through Hidden Figures provides a beacon of hope in a modern era that feels marked by uncertainty and despair.|Fresh
... strong performances by Henson, Spencer and Monae.|Fresh
It strikes a careful balance in showing how things were, and what they could be.|Fresh
These are emotional and nuanced performances that powerfully deliver a reminder of just how ugly a world of prejudice is.|Fresh

Watch this movie for the important story it tells - women standing up against racism and sexism in different and complex ways.|Fresh
"Hidden Figures"" is crowd-pleasing entertainment of vital history."|Fresh
The performances are warm and good-humored, without exception. It is absolutely an inspirational movie.|Fresh
Balancing each woman's story within the structure of the Space Race is deftly handled, as their workdays require them to give 110 percent and then go home and raise families.|Fresh
Salutes the trailblazing achievements of three African-American women who worked behind the scenes at Nasa as 'human computers', doing the hard sums before electronic machines were up to the task.|Fresh
It's mostly fine but largely forgettable, with a script that suffers from flat characters and which treats its story less like the powerful drama it is and more like a straight line evenly peppered with plot points.|Rotten
Hidden Figures is smart, funny, beautifully acted and altogether entertaining. And essentially true. What else could you possibly want?|Fresh
All things considered, Hidden Figures wraps some fairly radical themes - three African-American women entrusted with important NASA jobs at a time (1961-1962) when Jim Crow was still the law of the land - in a largely unradical package.|Fresh
... terrific drama, eye-opening history, and a great lesson for Hollywood.|Fresh
There's nothing wrong with Hidden Figures, and uncomplicated movies like it. It's certainly doing good by shedding light on some figures who shouldn't remain hidden in history.|Fresh
This drama, which puts black women at its center, is so triumphant, highlighting both the brilliance and lives of three women whose stories have been neglected in history books, and at the same time it elevates the profile of three great actresses.|Fresh
I liked Hidden Figures so much I went back to see it again. And I liked it just as much the second time.|Fresh
It may be predictable but it's also one of the most uplifting and triumphant movies of the year.|Fresh
Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe are very, very hard to dislike.|Fresh
The film isn't always subtle, but a broad brush sometimes leaves behind a big, beautiful swath of color.|Fresh
A largely prosaically told reworking of the outsider-versus-the-system paradigm that gains piquancy from the story it has to tell and the vibrant personages at its centre.|Fresh
Taraji P. Henson as Katherine Johnson grows more and more confident in each scene. Her gentle no-problem-sir demeanour melts away into pure passion.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is a rich and uplifting experience.|Fresh
It's a terrific story told with a lot of verve and charm.|Fresh
It's the sparkling individual components that comprise the ideal equation here, rather than any attempt to craft a new formula.|Fresh
A movie that is important, well-performed, and entertaining. It's a real crowd-pleaser, in other words.|Fresh
Just like NASA is feeling its way around space, one rocket at a time, the women in Hidden Figures are launching minor revolutions on the ground, one mathematical formula at a time.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is engaging, entertaining and enlightening -- but by playing fast and loose with historical fact, it risks blunting some of the story's eye-opening emotional force.|Fresh
In the two years since Margot Lee Shetterly's non-fiction book was optioned, the film's reflection on privilege feels even more relevant.|Fresh
"""Hidden Figures"" is a rousing story of unsung heroism adapted with the mass appeal of a colouring book."|Fresh
Very uplifting.|Fresh
The title is an amazing pun, based on black women working at NASA -- and the calculations they made to help the space race.|Fresh
Well, I know which film I'll be rooting for come Oscar night.|Fresh
This splashy, feelgood period piece is every bit as enjoyable as a best picture Oscar-nominated blockbuster could hope to be.|Fresh
Almost every one of the fudges makes the film more entertaining and less truthful.|Fresh
Despite the stellar cast, though, the film is weighted down by an overload of subplots.|Rotten
Hugely engaging, as well as important and inspiring.|Fresh
No people have ever deserved their own movie more than they do. And what a lovely movie this is.|Fresh
As [Melfi] proved in his previous film, St Vincent, he's good with actors and is a competent storyteller, but he can't resist underlining things that are already obvious.|Fresh
A heart-warming film and not one to be missed if you have lately been running low on inspiration in life. Let the stories of three geniuses tell you how a woman, despite several hurdles, can still cross the finish line.|Fresh
Directed with Oscar-baiting flourish by Theodore Melfi, Hidden Figures works well as a well-meaning, corrective history lesson designed to honour the talented women who worked away in historical silence while castigating the system that oppressed them.|Fresh
Even if some details have been massaged to fit the template of a Hollywood crowd-pleaser, the main thrust of the story is true and all the more remarkable for that.|Fresh
Yes, the story may have been panel-beaten into a gleaming, Oscar-friendly shape. That Hidden Figures is still so entertaining and moving is due in large part to a hugely likeable central trio of performances.|Fresh
This is an immensely likeable film and one that draws overdue attention to a story that has been neglected for far too long.|Fresh
Melfi's option for a brazenly feelgood formula could have easily undermined quite what a brutally obstructive status quo these women were facing up to but - thanks to trio of terrific performances - this is never an issue.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is light on its feet, warm-hearted and determined to entertain as well as educate.|Fresh
Hidden Figures completes its mission by landing a deeply touching and buoyant story that shoots for the stars.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is not a good movie. Sorry, but it's not.|Rotten
It's touching, sobering, sometimes funny, this lesson in racial history ...|Fresh
This is heartfelt and inspiring stuff.|Fresh
Hidden Figures isn't pushing the cinematic boat out in any new directions, but it steers its prescribed course nimbly and nicely.|Fresh
A remarkable biopic that demonstrates how holding back the tide of equality is detrimental to us all.|Fresh
You'd need to have a cold stone heart - or, I suppose, prejudicially racialist views - to dislike Hidden Figures ... A wonderful, rather incredible story, full of triumphant moments and performed by a perfect cast.|Fresh
Hidden Figures chronicles the trials and tribulations of these trailblazing women at an extraordinary time in human history.|Fresh
Melfi's cast are so cool, and this truly is a story that should be told, particularly while race and gender are still such burning issues.|Fresh
Race and gender politics enter as small, personal insults -- a segregated coffee pot, a condescending smirk, a closed meeting-room door -- but every setback is tied up neatly with a victory.|Fresh
"The performances here are wonderful and it is undoubtedly a ""feel good"" film with its warmth, vitality and empowering energy."|Fresh
A terrific film in the style of Hollywood 'applause' films, where the heroes or heroines are portrayed as not only morally superior but endlessly likeable|Fresh
It's a great, uplifting story filled with 'firsts' at a time in the 60s when segregation was rife, women's roles were compromised and the NASA space program was keenly competing against the Russians ... Three delightful performances bring the women to life|Fresh
An old-fashioned story about discrimination and overcoming; inspiring, hopeful and impeccably acted. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Essentially Parabolas & Prejudice, it isn't the most nuanced piece of work out this month. But nuance be damned - an uplifting plea for equality, this is a story calibrated for maximum effect.|Fresh
The pacey script is as slickly engineered as a Mercury rocket to include girl-power fun, romance and against-the-clock launchpad crises.|Fresh
While anger-inducing, Melfi ensures this film just about remains uplifting and inspiring, without compromising on the severity of the themes being explored.|Fresh
Hidden Figures isn't nearly as revolutionary or convention-busting as its subjects, but it illuminates an important story, and is given flight by three charismatic performers.|Fresh
It's helpful that the acting trio sell the somewhat saccharine story well.|Fresh

The true story of three patient and patriotic African-American women who make an invaluable contribution to the success of the early space program.|Fresh
We might already know the end of the film, which tends to feel a bit formulaic at times, but it still sucks us in. It's a feel-good story that's every bit worth rooting for.|Fresh
"With some audacity and ingenuity, ""Hidden Figures"" might have been something extraordinary. Instead, it's merely about something extraordinary."|Rotten
"If the currently released ""Jackie"" has an edge in glossy production design, the heart and soul of this film makes it stand a full head taller."|Fresh
It's the kind of movie where you compliment the performances and then trail off because there's nothing much left to say that won't make you sound like a jerk.|Rotten
"Uplifting, if not a little heavy handed, ""Hidden Figures"" is based on the true story of three very remarkable women and all three stars make the wise choice of not being stereotypical in their performances"|Fresh
It's a 'feel good movie' but Hidden Figures is never schmaltzy and is doesn't gloss over the weighty issues.|Fresh
It [Hidden Figures] makes our eyes wander and our ears perk, always on the look out for those who may next pioneer us into greater, undiscovered territories.|Fresh
With any luck, Hidden Figures will bring viewers to the nonfiction account by Margot Lee Shetterly on which it's based -- and serve as an inspiration for STEM-minded kids who rarely see parallels to themselves on film.|Fresh
Three heroic African-American women carry this true NASA story to the heights of crowd-pleasing. The recent death of living legend/astronaut John Glenn adds even more heft to a movie that should serve as an inspiration to anyone who perseveres.|Fresh
its story of triumph over adversity is not so much a historical lesson as it is a call to ensure that we stop making the same old mistakes|Fresh
The film never relinquishes its tight focus on three remarkable individuals who repeatedly demonstrate that they, too, possess the right stuff.|Fresh
A historical and pastel color drama that focuses in social awareness and sentimentality. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hidden Figures isn't a ground-, ceiling-, door-, or wall-breaking movie, but it entertains through its cast's charm.|Fresh
This is a movie that should be seen featuring a story that needed to be told.|Fresh
It's an uplifting cinematic experience that virtually anyone can enjoy, all while learning a story that deserved to be told.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is a great time at the theater.|Fresh
... inspirational but predictable celebration of sacrifice, can-do spirit of three exploited NASA workers ... feels pat, too self-aware ... may be overdoing things to redress past sins.|Fresh
The film's light, breezy entertainment value hides a deeper poignance, making it a nice complement to the heavier films that take the opposite approach.|Fresh
Hidden Figures deserves consideration as another great black hope of putting that #OscarsSoWhite problem to rest. More importantly, it's a lesson that African-American culture offers more inspiring stories than Hollywood has chosen to tell.|Fresh

Three strong, brilliant black women doing it for themselves by forcing a racist, sexist government agency to swallow a little Jim Crow in order to take America to the stars and back.|Fresh
You can start 2017 with positive vibes.|Fresh
Three women of color transcended the boundaries of their time. They rose above a segregated, sexist society to show that intellect is color blind and gender neutral. Hidden Figures is a long overdue story.|Fresh
A lovely movie, buoyed by understated performances.|Fresh
Smart and sweet, the movie doesn't so much press viewers to examine their own potential prejudices as it assumes the persuasive power of its own vision.|Fresh
It's pretty much perfect, and I cannot wait for general audiences to get the opportunity to head to the theatre and learn that blissful truth for themselves.|Fresh
Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe bring every ounce of their considerable charm to a script filled with humor and heart.|Fresh
Yes, the movie is idealized in its portrait of women who have undoubtedly been denied very ordinary human flaws and failings. But then, so what? They're heroes, every one of them.|Fresh
If Quentin Tarantino really only has two movies left, I pray that at least one of them stars Janelle Monáe.|Fresh
The film is dominated by the energetic and often moving performances of its three leads, and bolstered by the quieter but still excellent work of the supporting players.|Fresh
Hidden Figures may be the most entertaining civil rights movie I've ever seen.|Fresh
Despite admirable efforts from its high-powered cast, Hidden Figures takes a remarkable story and makes it feel the same as so many other movies.|Rotten
We learn about a largely unknown venue of the civil rights movement, but we also gain a general appreciation for the Herculean task of getting the Mercury astronauts into space at all.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is the rare true story-based historical drama that succeeds at being as inspirational and feel-good as it aspires to be.|Fresh
A by-turns infuriating and rousing feel-good drama.|Fresh
Brings to light a little-known facet of the American space program that simultaneously represents the best and the worst of what America had to offer at the time.|Fresh
... in light of national pride and recent politics, it's refreshing to see a film that shows individuals not only can work together but often enough had damn well better.|Fresh
Not enough can be said about the effort Henson, Monáe or Spencer put in. The three have impeccable chemistry and build their characters from the ground up, indelibly.|Fresh
Imagine The Help meets The Right Stuff and you get a very good sense of which buttons and emotional thrusters director Melfi is using to guide his plastic model of a moon rocket.|Fresh
With its by-the-numbers storytelling, 'Hidden Figures' has all the right stuff to enlighten the audience.|Fresh
Hidden Figures succeeds where other movies have failed in making mathematical equations interesting.|Fresh
It's a good family film in the sense that it probably won't upset anyone, but it's hard to escape the suspicion the real people on whose stories it is based deserve a more nuanced treatment.|Rotten
Considering it could be an inspirational calling card for girls and kids of all colors to brandish their smarts in the world of science and math, that only makes it all the better. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Square but rousing portrait of real-life figures who helped U.S. win Space Race. Great cast.|Fresh
Underneath convention is an inspection of tremendous intelligence finding its place in the world, with the production valuing education and problem solving, which doesn't come across the screen nearly enough.|Fresh
"In 2017, when the country feels as angry and divided as ever, ""Hidden Figures"" becomes more than just a well-made, inspiring and rousing piece of entertainment. It becomes vital."|Fresh
...an unabashedly feel-good movie, setting obstacles before its heroines and then showing their triumphs, while also offering the delights of a well-done period film.|Fresh
A movie about great people is not the same thing as a great movie.|Rotten
Hidden Figures soars in bringing their stories to light and it's long past due.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is triumphant in a way that can restore your faith in the dreams we can achieve in this nation if we all are willing to work together as one.|Fresh
It's clear that Hidden Figures is a story that demands to be told, and it's a pity it wasn't told better.|Rotten
Hidden Figures celebrates the achievements of these accomplished women, not only as pioneers in the space race but also as heroes battling obstacles big and small.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is exactly the type of movie that you think that it is. Only, it's better at being that type of movie than you probably expected.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is a mash-up of the space race and civil rights that serves both well.|Fresh
"""Hidden Figures"" is more than just an inspirational history lesson. It does the vital service of bringing long-ignored figures out of hiding and making their case to the world."|Fresh
This overeager, if oddly satisfying film details what it took for the U.S. to put a man in space at the height of the Cold War with Russia|Fresh
It's consistently good, very well acted, and it introduces us to a group of patriots previously overlooked.|Fresh
Both a dazzling piece of entertainment and a window into history ...|Fresh
This affecting story of reclaimed history is something to enjoy and celebrate with family members of all generations.|Fresh
Solving institutional discrimination has proven to be harder than getting John Glenn to circle the globe. But Hidden Figures focuses on people, not numbers or policies or platitudes.|Fresh
The story is compelling and the acting is very good in this historical drama about three women who succeeded in grand style against very long odds.|Fresh
Hidden Figures is a crowd-pleaser in the purest sense - it's a charming, heartwarming and inspirational tale that skillfully combines light-hearted comedy with racially-charged drama.|Fresh
Director Theodore Melfi ... creates an atmosphere in which Johnson, Vaughan and Jackson must be twice as good as those around them simply to succeed.|Fresh
Melfi tends to paint too much in the broad, amiable strokes of a triumph-of-the-week TV movie. But even his earthbound execution can't dim the sheer magnetic pull of an extraordinary story.|Fresh
"""Hidden Figures"" is a feel-good film of incalculable charm."|Fresh
"Goes beyond calling out prejudice because ""it's wrong"" and into its willfully ignorant blindness to bigger pictures of potential or accomplishment. It sees how cultural perseverance factors into much larger equations & earns inspirational bona fides."|Fresh
Henson, Spencer and Monáe all bring spunk, sass and heart to a story that oozes inspiration and rings with righteous pride.|Fresh
"Executed with love and peopled with actors who breathe life into their characters ... ""Hidden Figures"" is precisely the delight it aims to be."|Fresh
The film's made with more heart than art and more skill than subtlety, and it works primarily because of the women that it portrays and the actresses who portray them.|Fresh
Spencer gets most of the laughs, and Monáe has the showiest speeches, so they've been nominated for most of the awards. But Henson has the hardest role: a prodigy ill-used by a society that barely knows she's alive.|Fresh
It's both a vital and important piece of our history and a strikingly slapdash movie, clumsily executed and filled with scenes that are barely half-written, if that. These two facts can co-exist. One may matter more to you than the other.|Fresh
A rousing, uplifting tribute to three unsung American heroes. Splendid performances give the film full power.|Fresh
It might not leave an award-season mark, but its blend of heart, humor and history should score where it counts the most: at the box office, and in the minds of young viewers.|Fresh
A triumph, that never feels like homework or a history lesson (Splice Today)|Fresh
...a beautifully crafted film...|Fresh
Could hardly be more historically important, culturally significant, or inspirational, and as a PG-rated film, it's especially valuable as a STEM education boost for young girls.|Fresh
Melfi never loses sight of his heroines' dual struggle, as women and as black people. He encourages his actors to play on that duality with wisdom, anger, and a nuanced sort of farce.|Fresh
...a rare glimpse of the black experience as it pertains to wider American history.|Fresh
A potent film with strong performances that will bolster your belief that change can still be made with the right level of conviction.|Fresh
Paint-by-numbers biopic about people who were almost beyond a shadow of a doubt more interesting than the film ever suggests.|Rotten
Surprising and Uplifting|Fresh
... a valuable history lesson with plenty of built-in drama that eventually takes off.|Fresh
This untold story of African-American females who helped NASA conquer the cosmos features three incredible performances. Corny at times, sure, but you'll still want to stand up and cheer.|Fresh
This gloriously entertaining slice of American history will make you want to stand up and cheer. In many ways, it is just the movie we need right now.|Fresh
Despite at least one counterfactual scene and a runtime far too long, it's an interesting and intriguing tale and writer Margo Lee Slatterly, along with director Theodore Melfi, deserve a lot of plaudits for bringing the story to light.|Fresh
Tells a genuinely compelling story, but does so in a fashion that too often feels artificial, even borderline sitcomish [though] it's hard to resist the charm of the three lead actresses.|Rotten
A worthwhile, teachable moment about the indignities suffered by three heroic NASA mathematicians simply because they had the misfortune to be black during the South's shameful days of Jim Crow segregation.|Fresh
This film is designed to rouse an audience, and I can't see how it can fail to do so. The heroines of this tale are both admirable and likable, what the movie may lack in nuance it makes up for in good will|Fresh
a crowd-pleaser that pleases by tweaking formula in significant ways, even if the film subscribes to certain conventions.|Fresh
This movie is as much about science-faction, as it is a tense racial drama and a light-hearted comedy. It's an education film that should be mandatory viewing for the whole family.|Fresh
