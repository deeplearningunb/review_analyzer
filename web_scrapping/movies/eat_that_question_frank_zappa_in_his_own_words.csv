A must for Zappa fans -- and a maybe for those curious about the phenomenon that was the acerbic, iconoclastic, cynical and always outspoken experimental musician.|Fresh
Hungry freaks daddy! It is Frank in the flesh, nothing more, nothing less.|Fresh
In the film, as was probably true in life, Zappa gets the first and last word.|Fresh

Schütte's portrait of an avant-garde icon and iconoclast comprises concert footage and interviews over the years, including one by a state trooper, in which Zappa provides irreverent, articulate, deadpan answers to all questions.|Fresh
The interviews tell the story better than anyone else possibly could have.|Fresh
"When son Dweezil was born, Zappa filled in the spot for ""religion"" on the birth certificate with ""musician."" ""Eat That Question"" shows how true that was."|Fresh
Many of the interviews play like conversational grindcore - truculence branded with a scowl and an iconic mustache, soul patch and stringy black hair. It's a good show for everyone.|Fresh

... provides a fresh perspective for a new generation on an innovative entertainer whose stance on artistic freedom still resonates today.|Fresh

Trying to communicate the essence of musician Frank Zappa and his body of work in words is futile, even when the words are his own.|Rotten
...Zappa was an instinctive, unrepentant iconoclast...|Fresh
From the evidence of Thorsten Schütte's found-footage documentary...Zappa saw the interview as sometime endurance test, sometime amusement, and all-the-time chess match he could never lose, played as it was against lesser lights.|Fresh
The film can be frustrating for those who need a bit of context, but doesn't add anything new for the experts either.|Rotten
Zappa was never at a loss for words.|Fresh
There's no small irony in a Frank Zappa doc being built around the man's interviews, since he regarded journalism as a form of torture.|Fresh
As the title suggests, this is Zappa in his own words. And because he was so articulate, and so witty, Eat That Question is a highly entertaining voyage that also reframes Zappa as a pop culture figure.|Fresh
Consisting entirely of Frank Zappa interviews and performances culled from three decades of footage, Eat That Question has an almost symphonic flow.|Fresh
In interview after interview, Zappa is iconoclastic, articulate and hilarious, debunking myths about drug use, refusing to align himself with any ideology and critiquing American materialism.|Fresh
Frank Zappa was an innovative composer and musician, but as this royally entertaining documentary illustrates, he was also an articulate and opinionated man, high-minded and mordantly funny.|Fresh
Frank Zappa has always been an acquired taste, and Thorsten Schütte's otherwise terrific documentary Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words may not be the best place for a neophyte to start.|Fresh
Amusing and even edifying, although it is also unlikely to make converts out of those who just don't get Zappa's pastiche of juvenile parody and sophisticated songwriting, derived from rock, jazz and 20th-century experimental music.|Fresh
"""Eat That Question"" will please Zappa fans, but it's not just for fans only. It serves as a great introduction to an important artist who was ahead of his time."|Fresh
Zappa's fans and true believers will already be familiar with many of these clips, so the most Eat That Question can offer is fresh context. The fact that it seems to actively avoid contextualizing, then, is a problem.|Rotten
You don't have to like Kappa's music, or even know anything about it, to get something out of this informative film which includes caustic comments about virtually everything, government, religion, the music industry, American culture, and more.|Fresh
His rock music gets a decent airing, but you wish more of the man's perversity came through: his intimidating ego, the way he could exhaust his bandmates.|Rotten
Eat That Question is a fitting title for a movie that never quite gets at the mystery of Zappa's contradictions, even as it stacks up intimate live clips and fierce monologues from a rich trove of vintage interviews.|Fresh
The movie put me on a major Zappa listening jag ... which makes it sound like a fan-only proposition. It kind of might be, but I hope it isn't.|Fresh
Seeing Mr. Schütte's film, I'm reminded of how much more there was to explain about Zappa, and delighted to find how well the film explains it almost a quarter-century after his death.|Fresh

Along the way, we learn some things that may be surprising.|Fresh
Zappa made for a good celebrity if a rotten musician, and his takes on language and fame keep this doc sprightly and engaging.|Fresh
