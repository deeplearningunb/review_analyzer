A winner with historical fiction alone, [Campillo] goes further to create [the] nucleus of Nathan and Sean to show the emotional cost removed from politics.|Fresh
It's far from a heavy handed political lecture; this is a loving, moving masterpiece that manages to be equally intimate and epic- taking a political milestone for the LGBT community and making it personal in a manner that still resonates today.|Fresh
120 BPM is a very moving experience.|Fresh
Instead of hiding behind the specter of death, the film becomes a call to arms for resistance and hope, almost organic in its construction.|Fresh
A movie this well observed, this drenched in naturalism, this candid and poignant, can only spring from reality.|Fresh
Joins Phantom Thread and Loveless as a monumentally good film of 2018 ... Mention must be made of Nahuel Pérez Biscayart, who reminds me of seeing the young, wild-eyed Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon ... outstanding and should not be missed.|Fresh
And yet BPM (meaning beats per minute) is a beautiful film, full of drama and humour, love and politics, argument and action.|Fresh
It doesn't try to be a comforting film, and it certainly isn't. It's strident, unwieldy and confronting.|Fresh
As the film moves fluidly between protests, meetings, club nights, and affairs...we are left with the impression of a time and a place in which nothing, not even death, seems inevitable.|Fresh
The storytelling not only has an immediacy, it matches issues to individuals so that the campaigning is never merely about the public profile.|Fresh

The film gives off such a vivacious energy that it never feels of the past; it is a moment preserved exactly as it should be.|Fresh
This film reminds us that the battle isn't over yet.|Fresh
Campillo's engrossing human rights drama is top drawer foreign-language cinema and a must-see film.|Fresh
It's a funny, heartbreaking film, a little too long perhaps, but wonderfully evocative of an intense chapter in recent Parisian history.|Fresh
The movie is energised by credible writing, fluid editing and the performances of a young cast.|Fresh
Rebotini's dissonant, humming, house-inflected score - and the metronome-like heartbeats that underscore the action - are reminders that, even on their deathbed, a person has a pulse. In its dying gasps, the film grasps at life.|Fresh
It sets the pulse racing in what emerges as an adrenaline rush of a requiem.|Fresh
There's a poignant undertow to the rush.|Fresh
There are elements to admire - committed performances and noble intentions - but as cinema it's a non-starter.|Rotten

A deeply human drama, which celebrates the power of activism to awaken an indifferent world.|Fresh
Fly on the wall filmmaking at its best, this is pure cinema - an enthralling, enveloping experience that seizes you fully, effortlessly mixing politics, sex, life, death and art.|Fresh
Perhaps more impressively [director Robin Campillo] squeezes drama from the group meetings, which in most films would be snooze-fests.|Fresh
120 BPM understands that conflict is not abuse and that comrades need not be friends. It immerses us in tangled lives of passion and anger on their own terms of tenderness, frustration, charisma, mess, pride, fury, pain, laughter, intimacy and bitterness.|Fresh
The film captures very vividly indeed the urgency and turbulence of the period in which the AIDS epidemic took hold.|Fresh
A powerful document of a heartbreaking, yet hopeful, period.|Fresh
... thanks also to a terrific commitment to naturalistic lighting and hand-held cameras, that focus pays off in spades come the final third of the film.|Fresh
This film IS [Nahuel Perez Biscayart], a force of nature that seems unstoppable but at the same time shows its vulnerability with each beat. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Campillo is terrific at conveying a spectrum of emotions through his richly drawn characters, allowing you to feel what they feel in a relentless fight to save themselves.|Fresh
Gripping, multi-level, multi-character chronicle of ACT UP Paris in early '90s.|Fresh
A pungent piece of social history, chronicling the early days of the ACT UP movement in Paris with bawdy humor, bottomless compassion and a rebel yell.|Fresh
... how it didn't make the cut for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, I'm sure I don't know.|Fresh
While it tells a deeply affecting story about a gay relationship at its center, what lifts the film up to greatness is the way that it portrays a living, breathing community of gay activists.|Fresh
The film moves at all times... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Robin Campillo's vision transcends the mere recount of facts. It immerses the viewer inside the movement and dilutes the division between the personal and the political. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
However, in our current age in which social media has become the message, BPM is a good reminder that when physical bodies aren't present on the front lines their silence can very well indeed equal death.|Fresh
2017's best feature film...a masterpiece, an emotionally affecting epic. Campillo saves his most provocative moment for last, an astounding depiction of love, death and the fight for life.|Fresh
... you never lose sight of the vitality of the characters, their desire to live, and a sense of humor that even death cannot extinguish.... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In love, in life, in health, in illness ... the characters who travel this wonderful film are shown as political entities. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As rigorous as it is unique when it comes to addressing an arduous topic. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Thus, 120 Beats per Minute completely rejects the melodrama associated with the narratives about the syndrome... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is very didactic, but in a very natural way. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It deals with a dense and important subject without forgetting its characters have lives of their own and are capable of laughing and loving (otherwise, what's the point in fighting?). [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
A granular procedural about a group from the LGBT community fighting for equality, but one with which marginalised groups around the world today can easily draw parallels.|Fresh
The movie recreates the exhilarating-yet-exhausting feeling of those years. And it summons up the mundane awfulness of an early demise.|Fresh
The confidence and clarity of Robin Campillo's writing is evident from the film's opening scene.|Fresh
A worthy movie, if lumpy.|Fresh
This French film follows the activities of a group of Act Up activists in Paris in the mid-1990s. It looks like a documentary, probably because the writers and director drew upon their own experiences as Act Up activists to make this film.|Fresh
Passionate and heartfelt love story, set in Paris in the early 1990s, told against the background of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.|Fresh
Whether audiences are drawn more to the one-on-one homosexual romance or the larger scale story of activism at large, what cannot be denied is that BPM (Beats Per Minute) has authenticity and sincerely going for it|Fresh

BPM (Beats Per Minute) wrecked me something fierce, Campillo's latest a piece of historical fiction that's just as relevant today as it ever was a quarter-century ago.|Fresh
Quiet, intimately composed love scenes soon run up against blaring club sequences that see the characters letting themselves go in moments of nocturnal abandon|Fresh
BPM is a near-great film about hope and suffering that gives sex its proper rank in the scale of human relations.|Fresh
BPM is proof of the uneasy relationship between militants and moderates, and how bringing about real social change probably requires both personality types. Most of all, these people are brave.|Fresh
However specific its time frame and focus, BPM is not a narrow nostalgia piece, nor will it ever be as long as people are still dying, still being vilified.|Fresh
Without question, Sean is the film's center of gravity.|Fresh
"""BPM"" is a true and committed document, a worthy piece of filmmaking that keeps faith with the people it memorializes."|Fresh
BPM resists becoming a tragedy, even as it documents one. You could say it resists becoming the resistance, too, but there'll always be a chance to make that movie. In the meantime, Campillo has given us a hard-won, loving look at history.|Fresh
Combining stark histiography and intimate autobiography Campillo channels a past ingrained in both his and the public's memory.|Fresh
BPM (Beats Per Minute) is so fascinating and lovingly crafted that it leaves you wanting more.|Fresh

Campillo has taken his own experience as an ACT UP organizer and turned it into the best kind of cinematic memoir, a cathartic invocation of a lost moment.|Fresh
... both an incisive history lesson and a potent glimpse into the power of protest that carries contemporary resonance.|Fresh
There are undoubtedly more informative chronicles of the era, and more accessible ones too. But there's something uniquely, transcendently beautiful in Campillo's particular vision and the unhurried way he unfurls it.|Fresh
Mangeot exposes the electricity of living in that moment of time for the gay community, where amid the apathy and outright hate from the outside world, an unbreakable bond was formed - what a terrible irony that grief can be so beautiful.|Fresh
In its balance of resistance, agony, and joy, BPM (Beats Per Minute) approaches this subject with the the nuance and empathy it deserves.|Fresh
Even if you consider yourself reasonably well-versed in the history, BPM is a kind of wake-up call, a cinematic alarm against complacency.|Fresh
BPM is vital for the history it depicts, but it's also important in the here and now, as a testament to public action - even messy, not-always-effective public action.|Fresh
Even with all the quiet moments of healing and comfort you expect to see in a movie about people who love each other, it turns out the heated arguments are the true secret to the film's success.|Fresh
Necessarily insular and sometimes claustrophobic, a reminder of a time not long ago when the AIDS crisis was both roundly ignored and deeply stigmatized.|Fresh
"In spite of its historical specificity, ""BPM"" never feels like a bulletin from the past. Its immediacy comes in part from the brisk naturalism of the performances and the nimbleness and fluidity of the editing."|Fresh
The title refers to your heart rate, which should increase as you experience this moving and powerful portrait of a tragic yet inspired era.|Fresh
Campillo, who co-wrote the script with AIDS activist and educator Philippe Mangeot, captures the mood of an era with a specificity that's by turns somber and joyous.|Fresh
The brilliantly edited finale takes your breath away and pummels you with its raw, humane power|Fresh

A valuable and heartfelt document ...|Fresh

What saves the film is the love story between two ACT UP members whose care and devotion to each other provide an emotional touchstone the rest lacks.|Fresh
An involving and erotically charged discourse that puts sex and politics on the agenda without ever compromising on cinematic flair.|Fresh
What an experience BPM is. How intelligently and honestly it tells its story. How movingly it honors a community of victims, survivors and fighters.|Fresh
BPM thrives on political (and hormonal) energy. The bickering among the group's members turns wonky, vicious, and lively.|Fresh
In between raids, in between the meetings with ACT UP members and those who hold the keys to their possible survival, BPM is at its most intimate when observing the exchange of war stories.|Fresh
It is a flawed film. But its sweep is irresistible.|Fresh
It's stylistically beautiful, has an extraordinary cast and a soundtrack that heightens its emotion, but I couldn't help but be slightly disappointed by it.|Fresh
The subject could hardly be more fascinating, and the devotion of these characters to living full lives, even with T-cells falling away and a dire clock ticking over all their futures, is exactly as moving as you would hope.|Fresh
If the second half of the film is more conventional, it also packs a powerful emotional wallop.|Fresh
This is a Serious Movie that engages the intellect with compelling depictions of place, time and people.|Fresh
A film that never feels plainly like a mouthpiece for a vital issue, but embodying it with intense formal power and raw humanity.|Fresh
Campillo's film has a furious forward momentum that's inspired by the determination of its characters and bolstered by Arnaud Rebotini's house-music score.|Fresh
120 Beats Per Minute is a powerful film dealing with people politicised by a disease and is a tribute to the people who fought and continue to fight for all our rights.|Fresh
It offers not only compelling social-realist ideas on its surface, but finds visually evocative ways to express them.|Fresh
There's no shortage of incisive material contained here, and a more rigorous edit would greatly improve the lovingly made production's international prospects.|Fresh
The film is loaded with a particular energy, which Campillo uses to explore in the intimate life of its protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Counting on formal moments of extraordinary beauty, the film loses force by wanting to embrace too much. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a vital contribution to queer and political cinema, a testament to crusaders of recent history whose nobility does not preclude their complicated and individual humanity.|Fresh
Arrives at a powerful raison d'etre.|Fresh
The argument gave for much more but its development falls short. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The film offers an European perspective on the AIDS crisis, with an emphasis on different political positions, attitudes of solidarity and vital celebration in clubs. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's reality, it's AIDS, but inside. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Works as one of the most accurate notices that our forgetful society needs, not only for its message, but also for the timeless aesthetic that allows to assimilate the film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's the kind of story that could easily have lent itself to a shallow, made-for-cable social history, but director Robin Campillo achieves a touching and pointed mixture of styles.|Fresh
