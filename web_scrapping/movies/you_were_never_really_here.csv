"It's the kind of movie I'm glad [Ramsay] made because her interrogation of Joe's masculinity is the sort of thing endemic to the material that many male directors might have missed in an attempt to make the movie more ""exciting."""|Fresh
If you're up for a challenge, it's one of the more interesting and pessimistically poetic features I've seen this year.|Fresh
Lynne Ramsay's direction is as precise as ever.|Fresh
YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE beautifully blends the visual and aural power that cinema has to offer.|Fresh
It feels like shortchanging to call the filmmaking craft on display here impeccable... This is one of the best, most daring crime movies you will ever see.|Fresh
The film casts a disturbing, hypnotic spell viewers will find hard to shake.|Fresh
It's a rich blend of brutal beauty cut to a hypnotizing electronic score, all wonderfully balanced by Joaquin's physical performance -- it's spellbinding stuff and Ramsay's sensual style of story-telling is undeniably compelling.|Fresh
There's so much going for this film, it has such extraordinary craft on display.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a deep dive into the suffocating world of someone's personal hell.|Fresh
It is a performance of subtleties upon which the film hinges and Phoenix is mesmerizing.|Fresh
The movie is like a lucid fever dream.|Fresh
Uninterested in action or entertaining set pieces, Ramsay is rather painting a portrait of rampant brokenness that is unflinching and confidently stylish.|Fresh
Lynn Ramsey's disturbing grindhouse thriller takes active interest in cycles of violence and the physical and emotional scars of trauma.|Fresh
Hurt people hurt people.|Fresh
We feel as if we're in the room with Joe when he's having his flashbacks. There are times when we might actually be in his head - not an especially desirable residence.|Fresh
It's an assault on the senses, an unrelenting portrait of brutality that nonetheless finds instances of beauty among the chaos.|Fresh
I was merely the spectator without a specified role, watching a dead world decay even more. And maybe that's okay.|Fresh
This film details a character portrait with a unique style and is headlined by a slick Phoenix doing solid work. Even if the odds are poised to stack against the narrative.|Fresh
t's a timeless film to savor.|Fresh
Builds like a tornado towards a haunting finale that showcases just why [Ramsay] is one of the finest and most singular filmmakers around.|Fresh
The film is technically impressive in every respect with fine, fluid camerawork by Thomas Townend and an impressive electronic music score by Jonny Greenwood.|Fresh
Enough information is provided to let us discern the rudiments of a conventional plot - but our understanding of this remains tentative, hypothetical, shadowed by the possibility that all is not as it seems.|Fresh
You could describe You Were Never Really Here as a hitman thriller, but it doesn't quite do justice to the bedazzling ways that Scottish director Lynne Ramsay... takes Jonathan Ames's novel and transforms it into a tender, fragmented nightmare.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here feels much more remote and unreal in its scenario, and though it has been compared several times already to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976), I'm not sure that the comparison holds weight.|Rotten
Offers plenty in the way of structured ambiguity, so much so that I'm afraid it's most appealing as a deconstruction of Ramsay's own authorial voice.|Fresh
Lynne Ramsay stylishly experiments with the 'cold-blooded murderer who cares for his mother' trope, but comes up only with blood-spattered armchair philosophy.|Rotten
It's an incredibly well put-together movie just from every aspect.|Fresh
This is a beautifully rendered and told story that is absolutely torturous, but delightfully torturous to watch.|Fresh
Ramsay parcels out little pieces of the story, then pulls back and reveals something else. It is one that is almost impossible to predict, which is refreshing in an age of cookie cutter mysteries and by-the-numbers blockbusters.|Fresh
An unparalleled exercise in economy, Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here cements her status as a cinematic master.|Fresh
It's a filmmaker's film, sprinkling dreamlike, subliminal images throughout a dark, violent and disturbing story told in flashes of lightning, that has the shocking power of a sledgehammer and an ultra-high body count...|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here isn't just about the rescue of a State Senator's daughter. Rather an expression of a single man's existence, ghostly by all extents.|Fresh
Phoenix gives an astounding performance, bolstered by an unpredictable script and soundtrack.|Fresh
Lynne Ramsey has arrived back on our screens with a lean-cut, all-consuming character study that raises only questions and never answers; can we outlive our trauma or must we face it?|Fresh
The result, for those who decide to immerse themselves in this world, is often delirious and even beautiful. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a beautiful, strange, horrible, wonderful nightmare. It's not my favorite Lynne Ramsay, but it might be her most brilliant.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is not for everyone, but its wounded compassion is undeniable.|Fresh
You will question how much of it was real and what was in the mind of Joe and that is the mark of great art - it generates discussion.|Fresh
Ramsay's rickety balancing act is admirable, and one of the rare examples where brutishness and sensitivity feel synonymous.|Fresh
Dizzying pulsating soundscapes seamlessly edited around fleeting glimpses into disturbing past events and a subversive vision of vengeance; Ramsay and star Joaquin Phoenix have delivered something that refuses to be forgotten.|Fresh
Edgy, stylised, surprising, peppered with on and off screen brutal violence, intriguing and intense, frequent jump cuts and musical stabs, this is the work of a filmmaker whose excesses are adornments to her work.|Fresh
Tough and uncompromising, this is an extraordinary film in which stillness counters bloody violence and unconscionable themes.|Fresh
The trip that we are taken on is an uncomfortable one, and not for the squeamish.|Fresh
Phoenix can always be relied upon to go above and beyond the call of duty for a role, but as Joe, one wonders if he hasn't done lasting physical and emotional damage to himself.|Fresh
Pulls the rug out from under the hyper-masculine action genre.|Fresh
A psychologically rich dreamscape of alarming violence and latent human pain|Fresh
Ramsay ups the shock factor, lest we forget for a second the omnipresent anguish that lurks in banality.|Fresh
Lynne Ramsay's filmmaking in You Were Never Really Here is gorgeously precise. We feel there isn't a shot or an image that isn't there for some reason, though the reason may not at first present itself.|Fresh
A few individual moments crackle, but it's ultimately disappointing to see an artist as unique as Ramsay wrestling with something so familiar.|Rotten
It's sad and stunning and stressful and sometimes so darkly funny you actually wonder if you've dropped into another filmic world where such things can intermingle.|Fresh
Extraordinarily, Ramsay's film is not about people; instead it uses them and their bodies to explore American systems of power, and the abuse that develops within.|Fresh
Comparisons to Taxi Driver strike me as overly simplistic, though comparisons to John Hinckley Jr.'s reaction to same are less off-base.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a brutal film. You'll certainly flinch more than once, sometimes at what you think you might see rather than what you do.|Fresh
Lynne Ramsay's astonishing film, You Were Never Really Here, adapted from Jonathan Ames' noir novella is a taut, hypnotic drama. It is also one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
While the film is supremely engaging, it is Joaquin Phoenix, who breathes life and intrigue into its cold existence.|Fresh
Disarmingly effective in conveying how post traumatic stress disorder burrows into the deepest recesses of someone's mind, controls their every move, and casts an enormous shadow over everything that they see and hear.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is an exceptional film... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is an outstanding piece of noir... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
...takes the skeleton of an action movie and uses it as a scaffold on which to build a bleak and confronting portrait of trauma and loss.|Fresh
Ramsay's fourth feature does not hide his debts with classics such as Taxi Driver (Scorsese, 1976) and even the seminal western The Searchers (Ford, 1956), but the British director knows how to create truly absorbing images. (Complete review in Spanish).|Fresh
Ramsay has few films to her name, but as a director, she is a solid as they come. She has an ability to bring out the best in her actors and create rich and seamless narratives.|Fresh
Like an impure lovechild of Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here is a tense, brutal revenge picture, featuring a terrific Joaquin Phoenix performance.|Fresh
Phoenix gives one of his best performances yet, and Ramsay's talent can't be denied. Unfortunately, the end-result is style over substance, thanks to weak writing/story. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Ramsay created a parable about the perversion in which Joe (Phoenix) ends up involved in and the awful realities of that underworld. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Expelled, destroyed and brutally intense. [The film] is a piece of difficult but tolerable suspense... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lynne Ramsay conserves the essence of film noir, but presents them in such a innovative way that they seem almost unrecognizable. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Director Lynne] Ramsey, a consummate artist, creates a complex portrait of post-traumatic stress syndrome... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ramsay gives us a laser-focused thriller closer to Herman Melville than the usual Hollywood fare.|Fresh
Director Lynne Ramsay cuts away anything thrilling, or even compelling. It's a vigilante movie so aestheticized that it loses its energy - knuckle sandwiches with the crusts cut off, served on a doily.|Fresh
Its strength lies in its ability to surprise, which comes directly from experiencing a cruel, cruel world the way a severely traumatized man sees it. It's how Joe makes sense of his reality that says the most about human fragility.|Fresh
You Were Never Here has an upsetting, dreamlike quality that lulls you through its 129 minutes and holds you on the edge of a precipice that never fully delivers.|Fresh
Phoenix comes close to delivering a near flawless performance that will continue to haunt long after the end credits fade away.|Fresh
"A prime example of the work that can be produced if, instead of arguing with a ""difficult"" director, you have faith in their abilities."|Fresh
At once horrific and poetic.|Fresh
...a fairly conventional premise that's employ to consistently (and increasingly) avant-garde effect by director Lynne Ramsay...|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here doesn't quite work for me ... but it is certainly worth watching once it hits streaming services for Phoenix's performance alone.|Rotten
...a harrowing evocation of life as a trauma survivor.|Fresh
Incredibly good at building up that lacerating, painful feeling through image, through sound, through psychology, through the agonies on Phoenix's face.|Fresh
Maybe the film will be best enjoyed by those who are hammered.|Rotten
In You Were Never Really Here, Lynne Ramsay's status as an artist of uncompromising originality and skill is stronger than ever.|Fresh
Just something that you see and can't unsee, and you keep thinking about it...it gets into your soul.|Fresh
[Director Lynne Ramsay] adapts Jonathan Ames' bear-paw swipe of a novelette and turns what could have been a lurid potboiler into a bracingly strange thriller centering around its protagonist's troubled head.|Fresh
In its skittering vision of innocence corrupted, the film's beauty spellbinds even more.|Fresh
Even eschewing plot excesses, Ramsay wouldn't be so successful without the arresting cinematography by Tom Townend, the brilliant score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, and the unblemished editing by Joe Bini.|Fresh
"Ramsey steals a dozen little tropes from movies like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Taxi Driver"" to piece together a baloney narrative that hangs together like wet seaweed on the beach."|Rotten
This is an amazing movie that's not for everyone.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here has less success breaking the mold for its genre, but explores the often ignored corners in thoughtful and intriguing ways.|Fresh
The movie gives us glimmers of trauma from Joe's childhood life, but they're never explained, simply served up as fractured psychological backstory.|Rotten
"Writer-director Lynne Ramsay's masterful thriller turns the ""hitman movie"" genre on its ear with a fractured, impressionistic style that matches Joe's jumbled mind."|Fresh
Phoenix is in complete sync with Ramsay's cryptic style - he slugs through the action as though bearing the weight of a thousand unspoken guilts.|Fresh
Un fascinant hybride de drame psychologique et de film de genre, à la fois dense et minimaliste. [Full review in French]|Fresh
Watching You Were Never Really Here, I couldn't help marveling at the combination of daring and commitment it must have taken to make a film such as this, one that has little interest in reassuring an audience|Fresh
Extraordinary filmmaker Ramsay uses the gritty thriller genre to comment on the effects of a lifetime of violence. And in the mercurial Phoenix, her film resonates with a brutal beauty as one man's suicidal state is channeled into a righteous force.|Fresh
[Joaquin] Phoenix at his brooding-est also can be a lot to handle, although his best moments in a surprisingly vulnerable performance come in the moments between the outbursts.|Fresh
"One of the problems is the tone Ramsay is trying to set. Is ""You Were Never Really Here"" an artistic action movie? Or is it a character study of a damaged individual?"|Rotten
Expect this film, with its relentless brutality and aching sense of wonder, to seep into your very marrow.|Fresh
"""[Director Lynne] Ramsay has created an unnerving and aggressive cinematic experience. There is a thin layer of grime that coats the narrative that is extremely hard to shake."""|Fresh
Captures the nihilistic fever of TAXI DRIVER.|Fresh
It's an extraordinarily violent film, yet it's peppered with small moments of poignant grace.|Fresh
"""Features a gross, down-and-dirty performance from Joaquin Phoenix, probably the grungiest in a career full of them"""|Fresh
[T]he sheer power of artistic skill on the screen is striking and demands attention... This is what we mean when we say we want films that make us feel, and it's something [director Lynne] Ramsay has done consistently through her entire career.|Fresh
How does one see, how does one listen, but mostly: why must one remember? Crunchy, galvanic, volatile, tactile and brutally, weirdly funny... The world is terrible beauty. Nearly every image is lapidary confection but without preciousness.|Fresh
Ramsey blankets You Were Never Really Here with a woozy daydream fabric, moments that seem to have come in-between rational thoughts and are more like impulses or intuition.|Fresh
Phoenix's nuanced yet epic performance-the guy's perfected pushing the brink of losing control-melds well with Ramsay's impressionistic style.|Fresh
With You Were Never Really Here, Lynne Ramsay has molded a sleek masterpiece, unafraid of the notion that, in the end, we may all be lost to our own pain.|Fresh
Yes, derivative to a fault. But Cannes award winner Phoenix is powerful as shattered combat veteran.|Fresh
You won't have a fun night at the movies if you choose to see You Were Never Really Here, to be sure, but you will certainly have a memorable one.|Fresh
You can never accuse Joaquin Phoenix of phoning in a role; he always throws his entire body weight at a character, and this time that body weight is bulked up, his battered dad bod on full display in several scenes.|Fresh
We do not deserve Lynne Ramsay.|Fresh
[It is] anchored by Joaquin Phoenix's most damaged characterization since The Master.|Fresh
[Joaquin] Phoenix is at his shell-shocked best as the haunted Joe, veering between explosive violence and surprising tenderness.|Fresh
Upsetting, dreamlike, original and beautiful in a horrible way.|Fresh
In a case of trying to run before knowing how to walk, Ramsay tries to make a different kind of action movie without bothering to master the rudiments of the form.|Rotten
Joaquin Phoenix has never been shy about going big if the role called for it -- and maybe even if the role didn't necessarily call for it -- but his performance here ranks as one of his best because of what happens between the outbursts.|Fresh
The film's a brutal, cerebral exposé that's bone-bruising in execution.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here has been beautifully if discordantly crafted.|Fresh
A real stunner.|Fresh
Ramsay's storytelling reflects the broken mind and soul of this man. Her style ... understands that this man is working on some unstoppable, unappeasable impulse.|Fresh
Ramsay's screenplay is based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, which scans as the leanest of prose. Ramsay turns it into violent, visual poetry.|Fresh
There's Phoenix's performance to admire, but in the end it seems to have been generated in service of a film that's more a visual exercise than a potent drama with something to say.|Rotten
It's more lucid nightmare than film, just as terrifying and self-fulfilling as anything your subconscious could conjure.|Fresh
It's masterful work from one of the best actors of his generation.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here amounts to more than a Taxi Driver for our time. Despite the obvious homage, this is a Ramsay film, rooted in the Glaswegian auteur's feverish, kaleidoscope style.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a demanding film, but it's not a reckless one. To watch it is to see a rigorous and intensely creative filmmaker at work.|Fresh
"""You Were Never Really Here"" is as uncompromising as films get, a kind of concentrated trip through the violent thoughts and actions of a seriously disturbed man who also happens to be the hero."|Fresh
[Lynne] Ramsay shoots [john's] operations with the same lean, clinical skill with which he executes them: a master class in melding of performance and editing.|Fresh
Audiences, particularly heterosexual male audiences, still eat up the old rugged-individualist noir cliches. It's about time a female director of serious nerve threw the genre a curveball.|Fresh
A visceral viewing experience, but it's not vital work from Ramsay, who returns to her screen interests and habits, covering artful ways with blood and noise.|Rotten
This strikingly well-crafted film is a return to director Ramsay's singular strength as a filmmaker: radical empathy for damaged, vulnerable characters.|Fresh
It's like a Charles Bronson movie directed by Alain Resnais.|Fresh
You don't watch You Were Never Really Here. You fall into it, one shot and sound at a time.|Fresh
Through it all walks Phoenix as Joe, and rarely has this mercurial actor seemed so simultaneously threatening and vulnerable, unstoppable and lost.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a visually arresting, hypnotic, distressing fever nightmare look at PTSD; Joaquin Phoenix is sensational. This film will never leave your mind.|Fresh
On screen, it's not very deeply felt. Phoenix gives his all, but Ramsay plops us down in the middle of Joe's breakdown, before we can get our emotional bearings.|Rotten
Ramsay's limber direction and another phenomenal leading performance by Joaquin Phoenix lend the material an aching sensitivity and an arrhythmic but persistent heartbeat.|Fresh
"""You Were Never Really Here"" is a good film, maybe even a great one. But I can't honestly say that I liked it."|Fresh
Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all.|Rotten
Led by a career-best performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here shows that writer/director Lynne Ramsay is certainly here without a doubt.|Fresh
The film's violent mood is brought out in its dark hues and shadows as the wild-maned and bearded Joe, a man of few words and all action, dispatches the enemies of goodness.|Fresh
If you're left a little in the fog as to what's happened and why, it's not a drawback: The execution is so assured, you simply go with the flow of striking, suggestive images.|Fresh
Ramsay has concocted a lean, mean movie that skimps on specifics yet still packs a wallop. It's one of the most remarkable examples of less-is-more storytelling in recent memory.|Fresh
This is cinema in every sense, the kind of film that demands your full engagement with every moving part of film as a medium as it unfolds.|Fresh
Like its protagonist, an efficient, sensitive and, in bursts, gruesomely violent punch to the gut.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is hard going: easy to revere, fascinating to explore, but nagging in its grimness and, were it not for the rooted presence of Joaquin Phoenix, difficult to believe in.|Fresh
[Lynne] Ramsay's abstractions take their most productively aggressive and abrasive form here, throwing Joe's agonies at us like grenades.|Fresh
"This psychological portrait cum modern pulp noir is not for the faint of heart, often playing like an homage to the last fifteen minutes of ""Taxi Driver,"" but the film's horrific elements are cloaked in a state of grace, Ramsey's achievement remarkable."|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a breakdown shot in hyperdrive, lean, economic, utterly ruthless and made with fiery craftsmanship.|Fresh
Joaquin Phoenix has found the perfect filmmaker for his talents in Lynne Ramsay, an impressionistic master.|Fresh
Joaquin Phoenix's haunting performance galvanizes this bleak but powerful thriller.|Fresh
A taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.|Fresh
A fascinating case study of a man losing himself to the seduction of violence while caught in the whirlpool of trauma's lasting tentacles.|Fresh
With a jarring 11th-hour twist, [director Lynne] Ramsay leaves you pondering what menace lies beneath all those familiar sights and sounds.|Fresh
Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.|Rotten
Joaquin Phoenix is simply stupendous in a revenge thriller from the brilliant Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay that gets under your skin and makes it crawl. You won't know what hit you.|Fresh
[We see] an actor who relies not on his own recognisability, but his ability to make a character recognisable, who takes the exploitation flick staple of a broken veteran out for revenge and makes him real.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here may be something of a blunt instrument. But it still managed to knock me out.|Fresh
The gravity and force of Mr. Phoenix's performance and Ms. Ramsay's direction are impressive, but it's hard not to feel that their talents have been misapplied, and that there is less to the movie than meets the eye.|Rotten
It's not just a great thriller, it's a great film about psychological collapse.|Fresh
Lynne Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here could be considered artsy exploitation, a film whose formal dexterity belies its debts to its chosen, and quite squalid, genre.|Rotten
Bleak but effective thriller is brutally violent.|Fresh
Violent, provocative, and disturbing, Ramsay's picture is as bleak as a freshly dug grave...When everything works, we can see just how brilliant, original, and world class a director this Glaswegian can be.|Fresh
Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as he walks through an adventure like a man in a fog.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a masterpiece of monstrous beauty and grief-stricken rage that burrows under your skin and into your head, and refuses to leave.|Fresh
Here, for once, style delivers substance.|Fresh
But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects.|Fresh
The director, Lynne Ramsay, has a talent for arresting imagery and the generation of disturbance... Yet this, and Phoenix's considerable screen presence, are not enough to carry the film on its own: it needs ballast, and elsewhere there is only schlock.|Rotten
This one is as challenging and unpredictable as its star.|Fresh
[Director Lynne] Ramsey creates a highly subjective experience with her visuals largely mirroring the rocky instability of Joaquin's Veteran Joe.|Fresh
What's interesting about this film is not so much its story as the clammy, visceral way Ramsay tells it. It's breathless, bleary stuff, pure cinema, and Joaquin Phoenix is superb in the lead.|Fresh
Slow and idiosyncratic, it's difficult to know which is working harder -- the driving score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood or Joaquin Phoenix as a traumatised, hammer-wielding hitman hired to find a senator's daughter.|Fresh
If the test of great acting is to make it physically impossible to imagine the actor in any other role than the one you were watching, then Phoenix here nuzzles up to the greats.|Fresh
I'd happily pay to see this movie again. And again. Phoenix and Ramsay are demonic upstarts. And for most of this movie it's just heaven to be by their side.|Fresh
Phoenix's jittery performance chimes beautifully with Jonny Greenwood's unnerving score, Thomas Townsend's astonishing cinematography and Joe Bini's boundary-pushing editing.|Fresh
From the disorienting opening to the enigmatic finale, Lynne Ramsay is always really here, her commanding vision shining through every frame.|Fresh
a disorienting, dreamy take on the revenge thriller, with suicide an ever-present possibility and recovery (in every sense) the near unattainable goal of the mission.|Fresh
A stunningly lean and intense avenger noir, its thriller storyline studded with cryptic flashbacks and off-kilter violence.|Fresh
Odd, uncompromising, but brilliant.|Fresh
I found it mannered, over-directed, listing towards the pretentious, and all too aware of its own strangeness. But it's never dull.|Fresh
What a film.|Fresh
Nasty, nihilistic and nightmarish, this is tight as piano wire and twice as deadly.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is brilliantly made, daringly structured and invested with jumpy, lurid lyricism. But this stylistic triumph fails to resonate emotionally.|Rotten
If you're still with the movie after the first ten minutes you're probably with it for the long haul (and possibly for life -- it lingers).|Fresh
It's a film distinguished by the force of its images and the compression of its narrative, and while its impact leaves you dazed, you can't quite believe that what you've just seen ever happened.|Fresh
Based on the novella by Jonathan Ames, the film has the casual, sadistic violence of a Tarantino film, but none of the narrative inventiveness, as far as I could fathom. Or narrative clarity.|Rotten
The excellent film that you never want to see again - to that harrowing honour roll we now add You Were Never Really Here.|Fresh
[director Lynne] Ramsay creates many memorable images and evokes a disorienting atmosphere.|Fresh
The film is a bad trip so trippy you could start to enjoy its fortissimo miserabilism.|Fresh
An intense and brutal thriller, this is our millennium's Taxi Driver|Fresh
Ramsay is now four for four, one of our most exciting filmmakers. If she could not leave it so long next time, that's just fine with us.|Fresh
You don't watch a Ramsay film - you're consumed by it. You Were Never Really Here is the greatest testament to that.|Fresh
Nothing plays out as you expect, with Ramsay maintaining an unsettling staccato that keeps both the action and the viewer on edge.|Fresh
Lynne Ramsay returns with a scuzzy, stripped-back thriller focused on the man, rather than the mission.|Fresh
Arguably among the finest films of the decade, with career-best work from Phoenix and masterful direction by Ramsay.|Fresh
Even if the film meanders a bit in the beginning, the wait is worth the final product.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a gem for action fans and arty connoisseurs alike. We're all very lucky it's really here.|Fresh
Presents itself as just your run of the mill revenge thriller, but as a character study of a killer it is anything but run of the mill.|Fresh
A film of external beauty in Ramsay's visual language and sound design but it's anchored by the internal work of her leading man.|Fresh
This is a stunning, gut-punch of a film though, technically adept and masterfully acted it thumps others of the genre into mush, showing that a Taken-style story needn't be redundant of art.|Fresh
[Lynne Ramsay's] latest work is a triumph of style.|Fresh

It's the rare film that, after the overwhelming first viewing experience, doesn't feel like hyperbole to call a genre redefining masterpiece.|Fresh
One of [Jaoquin Phoenix's] best recent works. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Director Ramsay's] return seals her standing as one of our most fearless and forceful filmmakers, if not one as prolific as she deserves to be.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a bold piece of storytelling, with a dream-like feel that evokes its hellish, predominantly nocturnal world very compellingly.|Fresh
A transcendent, at times almost dangerous film.|Fresh
Ramsay has pulled off the extraordinary, crafting a muscular and tightly wound masterpiece that ripples with a haunting complexity and features an intensely riveting performance from Phoenix.|Fresh
Phoenix feels like a fish in the water playing another moron in a silly story, as poorly written as directed. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Unlike his previous works, Ramsay goes to the point giving a class of narrative synthesis. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This film (or at least this version) looks like a failed experience of the Scottish director in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Joaquin Phoneix is irrefutable, turned forever into Ulysses, into a simple wound. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the conception of Joe, the protagonist played by the ever-laudable Joaquin Phoenix. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film confirms Ramsay's status, who has not filmed enough. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The film doesn't cease to show and to force its style and the staging ends up being excessively pretentious. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The greatest strength of the film comes from the intensity with which the face, body and movements of a magnificent Joaquin Phoenix are captured. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Joe is, to all intents and purposes, a ghost. The camera know it, and from there our fascination to contemplate it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a work where you sit back and let a master storyteller guide you - you may not always know where you're at, but are constantly rewarded for your patience.|Fresh
In these staggeringly taut 85 minutes, Ramsay sees a hopeless universe in a jelly bean.|Fresh
Ramsay has made a terrific short story, economical as hell but also so moment-for-moment gripping that you want to pore over its every shot, its every dark cranny.|Fresh
"Lynne Ramsay has made a film that burns so much brighter and cuts so much deeper than any such story has a right to. Do you remember the first time you saw ""Taxi Driver""?"|Fresh
An exhilarating, tense and beautiful film.|Fresh
One of the most ferocious indictments of systematic abuse of power and gender violence ever projected on a screen.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a brutal, punishing watch, but every minute is a masterclass in filmmaking.|Fresh
To watch Phoenix, an actor at the height of his dramatic powers, on screen and under Ramsey's direction makes You Were Never Really Here something of a must-see.|Fresh
There are multitudes in here, but not a second is wasted. It is a brash, noisy, violent picture, but it is also a subtle, intricate, thoughtful one.|Fresh
You Were Never Really Here is a powerful assault of a film, but it's missing its director's inimitable poetry.|Fresh
