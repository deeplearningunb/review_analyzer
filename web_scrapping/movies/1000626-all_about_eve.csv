Classic movie about an ambitious woman.|Fresh
Sanders...was ideally cast in this role: you can feel in Addison's every word the world-weariness of the actor who would eventually commit suicide at age 65...|Fresh
It crackles with smart, smarting dialogue.|Fresh
Joseph L Mankiewicz's wonderfully literate 1950 classic drama of the theatrical life, All About Eve, is back in the cinema, to be savoured for its language, performances, psychological insights and proof that all the world's a stage.|Fresh
The Zanuck production investiture is plush in every department.|Fresh

Put simply, one of the greatest movies ever made.|Fresh
The peerless tale of two rival drama queens, playing as the central attraction in the BFI Southbank's Joseph L Mankiewicz season, and rightly so.|Fresh
Here is a real Christmas treat: a restored version of Joseph L Mankiewicz's jet-black 1950 comedy about Margo Channing, elegant leading lady of the theatre, superbly played by Bette Davis.|Fresh
A total joy.|Fresh
One of Hollywood's finest backstage dramas. If nothing else Davis should have been rewarded for services to the tobacco industry.|Fresh
Apart from the monochrome photography, all that dates the film is the chain-smoking and the fact that these are theatre folk rather than movie stars (frequent in-jokes about the low art of Hollywood pepper the script).|Fresh
For old-school Hollywood movie-making at its most polished, literate and sophisticated there is really nothing to match it.|Fresh
There is so much to admire in All About Eve, even for those too young to be drenched in nostalgia for the spectacle of Bette Davis unleashing her sharp tongue.|Fresh
[Features] more quotable dialogue in one movie than most screenwriters manage in a lifetime.|Fresh
Still retains its stagy power to provoke theater lovers by its elaborate wit and campy bad taste.|Fresh

Amazing performances top the list of positive qualities in Joseph L Mankiewicz' All About Eve.|Fresh
Forget Foreman vs. Ali, this is Baxter vs. Davis in one of Hollywood's greatest showdowns.|Fresh
Bette Davis renders her most memorable performance as declining diva Margo Channing in one of Hollywood's wittiest satires of the Broadway theater, but, alas, she was deprived of getting the Oscar.|Fresh

Outstanding Mankiewicz film with the perfect cast.|Fresh
Mankiewicz's flair for dialog is so perfected that all three actresses shoot fireworks whenever they open their mouths.|Fresh
A fine Darryl Zanuck production, excellent music and an air of ultra-class complete this superior satire. The legitimate theatre had better look to its laurels.|Fresh
Fox has done an admirable job of trying to put a special edition together for this thing, and they should be rewarded. Just as the viewer shall be.|Fresh
Even after half a century, All About Eve's wit and bite is as sharp as when the film was originally released. It remains a timeless classic.|Fresh
In spite of the employ of melodramatic tropes such as shifting alliances and power-play seductions, the heart of the film is a woman's fear of aging.|Fresh
My all-time favorite film.|Fresh
A motion picture that, because of its priceless dialogue and unforgettable lead performance, will never lose its luster.|Fresh

They don't make 'em like this anymore!|Fresh
Mankiewicz's 1950 gem is a wickedly cynical cocktail of laughter and deceit in which everyone has an angle to play.|Fresh
It is, unquestionably, one of America's proudest moments, and before you line up for tickets to the new Adam Sandler vehicle, you may want to remind yourself of what movies used to be able to accomplish.|Fresh
The presence of All About Eve, while a relief, is also a sad reminder of how in certain ways movies have regressed in the past 50 years.|Fresh
With dialogue so crisp and poisonous, it makes you wonder where script-driven movies have gone.|Fresh
It's about the glory of acting.|Fresh
The film is filled with a nice dark humor that is rare for the I-Like-Ike decade of filmmaking.|Fresh
All About Eve (1950), is a realistic, dramatic depiction of show business and backstage life of Broadway and the New York theater.|Fresh
All About Eve is a film that you see completely differently once you know what's going to happen.|Fresh
The screenplay... may be the most biting example of hard-boiled wit ever to come out of Hollywood, and it is stylishly performed at a breakneck pace by a uniformly expert cast.|Fresh
"[Bette Davis'] veteran actress Margo Channing in ""All About Eve"" (1950) was her greatest role."|Fresh
No other movie makes being smart and cynical look like more fun.|Fresh
While its attitudes toward women are dated, its wit and perceptiveness are as fresh today as they were in 1950.|Fresh
