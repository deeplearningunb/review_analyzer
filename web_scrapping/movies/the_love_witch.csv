Anna Biller's bravura slice of burlesque cinema is at once deliciously innovative and delectably old school.|Fresh

Anna Biller has made the most visually captivating retro film of recent years. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Its smug, glazed beauty walled me off from feeling anything about it except impatience.|Rotten
... like Burn, Witch, Burn or Hammer's The Witches colliding with a Doris Day sex comedy in the free love hippie culture, all existing in a bubble of sixties style and attitude that is somehow intact in modern day North Coast California.|Fresh
Biller's challenge of the surface dares us to be mesmerised without being beguiled, and to parse the realm of female agency without demonising its contradictions.|Fresh
This preordained cult classic has been outfitted with a magnificently rough and colorful transfer, as well as revealing and appropriately fetishistic supplements.|Fresh
I think it's one of the most interesting, captivating movies I've seen in years, and I look forward to dissecting its lovely, twisted, romantic genius in future viewings.|Fresh
A side-swiping original that deserves its inevitable cult status.|Fresh
Lovers of old kitsch movies will appreciate this pastiche, an arch tale of a suburban witch.|Fresh
A consistently hilarious pastiche of camp 1960s thrillers, this nutty movie plays it dead straight, even though every scene is luridly over the top.|Fresh
The film offers a brilliant spin on the genre's despicable gender politics, all the while relishing in the pleasures of its outmoded visual style.|Fresh
This colour saturated world of hokey pocus is truly intoxicating ... [but] I just haven't fallen under The Love Witch's spell|Fresh
Even if the climax doesn't quite have the kick we might hope for, cult status surely awaits this bewitching oddity.|Fresh
[A] wonderfully entertaining hybrid of horror-comedy, soapy melodrama and 60s/70s-style sexploitation with a spiky feminist spin.|Fresh
Embracing Russ Meyer-style kitsch, but overturning the horror genre's sexist tropes, Biller delivers wry comment on the objectification of women in a film that's as smart as it is sumptuous.|Fresh
A note-perfect parody of the British Technicolor horror films of the Sixties.|Fresh
The Love Witch goes beyond camp, beyond pastiche; it ignites the pulpy surfaces of its tale and produces a smoke of bad-dream sexiness and scariness. It's a B-movie with A-grade potency.|Fresh
The mix of am-dram solemnity, grand guignol and Terpsichorean time-tripping is hypnotic.|Fresh
Even in the film's most far-fetched moments, Biller has trenchant points to make about conservative, middle-class America's fear of female sexuality and the double standards that apply to men and women's romantic behaviour.|Fresh
It's brash and bright, with a plot that's improbable in the extreme.|Fresh
A genre-stretching horror melodrama crafted with extraordinary detail and style. A touch languid, it's also mesmerising, provocative, unsettling and sensual.|Fresh
This smart and sexy comedy comes cloaked in faux innocence; it's a glorious oddity which casts quite the spell.|Fresh
Biller never lets deadpan fun drop into crude spoofing. Prepare to be bewitched, bothered and bewildered.|Fresh
A stylised invocation of camp 1960s Technicolor melodrama and 1970s Italian horror recast for an alternate history where the occult and gender roles overlap into feminist critique.|Fresh
A few more minutes of movie than might be necessary is a small price to pay for what's otherwise a piece of cinematic magic.|Fresh
The Love Witch works cleverly and determinedly to expose and finally explode the tensions and incomprehensions that our gender norms so often confine us within.|Fresh
Robinson, who delivers a performance that is alternately ironic and straight, is deft at bringing the whole shebang to life.|Fresh
A glorious feast for the senses as well as for the mind.|Fresh
A wildly assured, confident debut film, and one of the most visually stunning films of the year. (Splice Today)|Fresh
A retro 1960s film about witches, that puts a spotlight on their supernatural powers to drive men crazy over sex.|Fresh
Mercilessly carve out a third of the running time, and suddenly we have one of 2016's best, most subversively smart and deliciously entertaining films.|Fresh
Biller sculpts a very unique portrait of that era without putting to shame the films, authors and the elements in which it is inspired. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
. . . unabashedly satisf[ies] female cravings for self-validity, glamour, and, yes, love.|Fresh
[The Love Witch] is different from any other movies you'll see in this or any other year.|Fresh
"Though it may seem Biller is mountain an assault on delightfully garish exploitation fare - with overemphatic titles like ""Vixen!"", ""Score!"" and ""The Lickerish Quartet"" - that's not quite what she's doing."|Fresh
A vibrant and eye-catching homage to the Technicolor films of the 1960s, writer/director Anna Biller's The Love Witch is a seductive and clever twist on the gender politics, witch-centric cinema, and pulp storytelling of that era.|Fresh
Written, directed and edited by Anna Biller, this candy-colored homage to trashy horror and sexploitation is my pick for most visionary film of the year.|Fresh
If you're prone to acid flashbacks, watch out. Although it takes place in contemporary times (note the cell phones), Biller films the proceedings with a day-glo palette that resembles the Technicolor movies of a bygone era.|Fresh
Biller proves to be an auteur in the truest sense of the word: she directed, wrote, produced, and edited the film, and created many of the spectacular costumes and set decorations. She also, quite possibly, has created a new cult classic.|Fresh
There's nothing like The Love Witch, and that's a good thing, for if there were, I seriously doubt I'd be as captivated with this marvelous bit of murderous whimsy as I most assuredly am.|Fresh
Really knows what it's doing. And it's hilariously funny, sometimes in an almost subliminal way.|Fresh
Anna Biller's blissfully strange widescreen appropriation of the trappings of sexploitation, horror and high art, is a rubicund marvel, and a deadpan madhouse comedy... Biller's movie isn't beholden to influence, it's its own wild creature.|Fresh
While The Love Witch leans heavily on its inspirations, it isn't like anything you've seen before.|Fresh
If The Love Witch overstays its welcome, it at least has the courtesy to be ravishing to behold.|Fresh
The results are wildly over-the-top, in a Beyond the Valley of the Dolls-meets-Dark Shadows kind of way, but Biller's commitment to her vision is weirdly endearing.|Fresh
"The fear of female sexuality has been a staple of horror movies forever, but ""The Love Witch"" does more than simply subvert or parody the erotic underpinnings of the genre."|Fresh
"While ""The Love Witch"" stalls on occasion, it remains original and provocative, maintaining heat and a touch of cheekiness."|Fresh
"As with giallo, ""The Love Witch"" features deliberately wooden acting, and can be a little boring at times. But it's a stunningly photographed, fascinating reinterpretation of classic melodrama."|Fresh
It's cloaked in a retro wardrobe and soundtrack (much of the music, by Italy's Ennio Morricone, is sourced from '60s thrillers) but loaded with irony and a fluid sense of identity.|Fresh
It is a true auteur creation that is absurd and exhilarating, a fun-house mirror reflecting our times and the folly of women who seek to control a patriarchal system by submitting to it.|Fresh
The Love Witch is some sort of classic.|Fresh
The best kind of homage or parody, the type that honors every thrill and quirk of the original while improving on it.|Fresh

I wanted more from The Love Witch.|Rotten
Before you surrender to it, just remember that you were warned.|Fresh
Mere seconds into Anna Biller's candy-colored retro-horror film, you realize this movie is an ornate portal with a beckoning, bejeweled finger, and you're as helpless as one of its titular seducer's hexed-and-sexed victims.|Fresh
No man can resist the perfect female fantasy - and she certainly is a fantasy.|Fresh
Purveyors of genre curiosities should definitely put The Love Witch on their list; you'll either fall under its pastel and free love spell or find yourself screaming that you can't handle it. Just like Elaine's victims.|Fresh
Biller plays with the mixed-up messages that pop culture sends both men and women.|Fresh
[Biller] is a filmmaker unlike any other working today. I just hope it doesn't take another 10 years for her to make her next one.|Fresh
A nuanced statement on gender relations whose morals are as flexible as its formal qualities are rigid.|Fresh
Biller ... emerges as a feminist Russ Meyer skilled at fetishizing archetypal images of narcissism with the exacting eye of a Douglas Sirk.|Fresh
"Got to hand it to Biller - she might have made a ""bad"" movie, but it's never boring."|Rotten
Nails the look and spirit of macabre '60s B-movies, but largely leaves chills and thrills out of the brew, resulting in a handsomely crafted curiosity that's far from magical.|Fresh
Take a deep breath and exhale. The Love Witch is ready to blow your mind.|Fresh
Anna Biller's Technicolor throwback is a spellbinding feminist delight.|Fresh

Only writer-director Anna Biller's second film, The Love Witch affirms not only her skill as a director, but as an auteur.|Fresh
It's a neo-sexploitation movie with subtle feminist underpinnings.|Fresh
If only for the staggering, Rachel Maclean-like alternative reality that Biller creates, The Love Witch is a transgressive joy from start to finish.|Fresh
Anna Biller's The Love Witch is a movie aesthetes of kitsch will embrace with open arms.|Fresh
Though a little too languid at two hours, The Love Witch is appropriately seductive.|Fresh
all this [visual attractiveness] is part of the film's seductive artifice, fashioned to mesmerise the viewer in much the way that witch protagonist Elaine uses makeup, dress and wig to lure male lovers by reflecting their fantasies.|Fresh
The Love Witch may wear its influences on its sleeve, but those sleeves are beautiful.|Fresh
The Love Witch is a seductive 60s time-capsule that calls back to the technicolor charms of early genre filmmaking.|Fresh
It's a lovingly crafted ode to little-loved cinema that's secure enough in its obscurantist nostalgia to make a sly joke of its occasional anachronisms ...|Fresh
This is really quite wonderful.|Fresh
Biller has created a world of feminine mystique made tangible, colorful and tidy and sensual.|Fresh
Much more than just a meticulously constructed throwback, The Love Witch is gorgeous, sexy and mesmerising in every way.|Fresh
There is no denying the fact that The Love Witch is an exercise in self-indulgence, a nostalgia trip, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth indulging in.|Fresh
Destined to be a cult classic, this sophomore effort by Anna Biller is a heady throwback to the American and European sexploitation horror films of the late '60s and early '70s.|Fresh
Nothing less than a tour de force of 21st century queer, feminist film.|Fresh
This spellbinding ode to exploitation films of the 1960s and '70s is impressive not only for its mock-Technicolor hues and period mise-en-scne but also for what lies beneath.|Fresh
The Love Witch is a kind of horror movie but it's far more than just that. It's as much a vibrant, daring art installation as it is a kind of highly sexualized vintage movie of the week.|Fresh
