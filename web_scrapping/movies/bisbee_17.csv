One of the best films so far this year: a powerful meditation on art's transformative abilities, as well as a sobering reminder that in any conflict, it's the victors who usually write the official history.|Fresh
Topical and urgent.|Fresh
The play between past and present political predicaments of immigration, unionisation and corporate corruption piercingly resonate thanks to Greene's ingenious sense of staging...|Fresh
The Deportation seemed to disappear from town history. It was rarely mentioned. Even today residents don't really talk of the Deportation. It is a town that can keep a secret.|Fresh
Bisbee '17 speaks to the stakes of local history and amateur genealogy for places and people that are twinkling out of living memory.|Fresh
Robert Greene has created a thoughtful and sprawling documentary about facing up to the past by walking in the shadow of history.|Fresh
I was moved to tears, a rarity for me. It's closing passages are so exceptionally well-handled that one might actually forget they're watching a documentary recreation.|Fresh
Bisbee '17 is the rare documentary that also succeeds as a provocative cinematic statement.|Fresh
"The unorthodox methods of ""Bisbee '17"" conjure up the past in a powerful and cathartic way."|Fresh

"The unorthodox methods of ""Bisbee '17"" conjure up the past in a powerful and cathartic way."|Fresh
The film's epic canvas fuses a procedural documentary with tableaux that wouldn't be out of place in a horror western.|Fresh
Though it sometimes trades detail for its tricksy gimmick, Robert Greene's new doc is a chilling slice of untold American history.|Fresh
Bisbee '17 is fascinating because it represents a leap forward in the perfection of the filmmaker's style.|Fresh
Art, even of the amateur variety, has that singular power to transform hearts and minds, and that's what we get to witness here.|Fresh
With more intimate documentaries like Kate Plays Christine and Kati With an I, director Robert Greene has always found space for enigma in motivation, in a lack of resolution: Bisbee '17 cannot afford such space.|Fresh
As the crimes of the deportation haunts Bisbee and its inhabitants, so, too, are we haunted by them through the filter of Greene's lens. But that experience, the experience of being haunted, proves vital.|Fresh
Even though deportation is a tough subject, especially because of what is going on in America, I still really enjoyed this documentary.|Fresh
Despite a few slow spots, Bisbee '17 is a useful portrait of changing times in the West, as well as a reminder of how far we still have to go.|Fresh
Beyond the rote talking heads, the film's something of a dreamy cinematic wonder.|Fresh
Plenty of superb anecdotes.|Fresh
Director Greene does an earnest job in telling this unknown piece of history.|Fresh
There may never be justice for the victims of American trauma, but Greene has told one story no viewer could ever forget.|Fresh
[Robert] Greene's film moves in a forward, circular motion, through swift, precise interviews and extraordinarily evocative images of the mines that continue to remind us where we are.|Fresh
"""Bisbee '17"" plays its funny games in a far friendlier and more accessible, but still pointed, way."|Fresh
Like many arty contemporary documentaries, Bisbee '17 is rather theatrical. But that's reasonable in this case...|Fresh
There's no denying that Bisbee '17 has some moments of deep elegiac power or, for that matter, that Greene's ambition is boundless.|Fresh
On an emotional level, Bisbee '17 may be inadequate. On a technical level, it's extraordinary.|Fresh
Remembering the past is not enough to prevent its recurrence. It has to be kept alive.|Fresh
As actors and locals are assigned their parts for a centennial recreation, we hear from residents, most stating that they 'can see both sides.' The rhetoric is revealing...|Fresh
The sheer audacity and originality of the exercise makes it a must-see, regardless of what you might think of the success or failure of any particular choice.|Fresh
An often lethargic expos√© about a heartbreaking, horrifying and enraging event from America's past, but suffers from sluggish pacing, lack of profound insight and not enough scope. a squandered opportunity to shed light on an important human rights issue.|Rotten
Like all of Greene's films, it's more of a cannily controlled meditation than a traditional attempt at semi-objective portraiture, deliberately blurring the line between documentation and performance.|Fresh
"Even though ""Bisbee '17"" depicts a wholesome and harmonious community undertaking, it is a profoundly haunted and haunting film."|Fresh
The director purposefully pulls us this way and that, weaving cinematic spells and then yanking us out of them; as viewers, we are both inside and outside the story.|Fresh
This is, in large part, a documentary about its own making, openly welcoming questions about how much the presence of Greene and his crew are influencing what they capture.|Fresh
The results are as powerful to watch as they clearly are for those taking part, in a multi-layered documentary that uses everything it can to excavate the past.|Fresh
It's a shameful episode that Greene contends has never been properly acknowledged in the town... It's a good story, but despite his command of camera, music and mood, the film plays a little like a protracted rehearsal for a cosplay re-enactment.|Fresh
[Greene's] previous documentaries emphasize actors performing in staged scenarios to draw out emotional truths, and his latest is even more ambitious: an absorbing meta-doc with the sweep of a classic American western.|Fresh
The film is rich and multifaceted, as Greene employs an array of styles (historical reenactments, direct cinema-style portraiture, musical numbers) to investigate the complex relationship between Bisbee's past and present.|Fresh
"In ""Bisbee '17,"" Greene peels the layers of oblivion off history like so many layers of paint."|Fresh
The movie sometimes feels overlong and repetitive in its buildup to the reenactment, but becomes absolutely mesmerizing as the centennial of the deportation arrives and the event commences.|Fresh
Bisbee '17 is a fierce, lyrical probe into the soul of a town haunted by a history it would rather forget. It's also an unsettling cipher for America, in a year when the ghosts of our past revealed themselves in frightening ways.|Fresh
A bracing documentary that blends fiction and reality in ways that both complicate and enhance the material's core themes.|Fresh
[Greene's] intense focus on individuals can feel limiting in terms of the overall truth-and-reconciliation dynamic, but it also leads to some powerful moments. And the story's contemporary resonance couldn't be clearer.|Fresh
The result is a singularly American riff on The Act of Killing, a fascinating and dream-like mosaic that's less driven by residual anger than by cockeyed concern, less interested in exhuming the past than in revealing its value to the present.|Fresh
