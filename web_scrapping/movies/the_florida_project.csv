A powerful punch of empathic, humanist, character-driven cinema.|Fresh
If Tangerine was Baker's breakthrough film, then this just cements his status as one of the best young filmmakers in Hollywood today.|Fresh
The film never exploits its characters' lives, but simply understands them and, in turn, portrays them both sensitively and candidly.|Fresh
[These children] don't quite comprehend their parents' struggle or the life of excess and entertainment down the road. They simply find the joy and fun in what they have.|Fresh
What bothered me about this (and I ended up loving it) is that the kids are terrible.|Fresh
There's fascinating stories here and it is, at a meta level, almost heartbreaking, almost infuriating that we know that this is a slice of our population that lives this way and doesn't seem to have any other options.|Fresh
An exercise in empathy and exuberance.|Fresh
A powerfully moving dramady by Sean Baker who came a long way from filming a movie off an iPhone.|Fresh
I believe The Florida Project is a film with good intentions even though I remain unsure what they are.|Fresh
Moonee is somehow relentlessly entertaining without ever, even in the slightest bit, coming across like a child mascot dreamed up solely for our amusement.|Fresh
Newcomer Brooklynn Prince is pure magic; a firecracker of intensity and confidence, this girl is a star.|Fresh
A work that combines boundless energy and childlike enthusiasm with dark social realism, Sean Baker's wildly inventive style of filmmaking has resulted in the gorgeous masterpiece that is The Florida Project.|Fresh
With deep love and affection for their characters, Baker and co-writer Chris Bergoch create a vibrant community pushed to the fringes by economics but still bursting at the seams with creative possibility.|Fresh
The Florida Project could easily be a Best Picture nominee this season. Baker's direction is so fluid, and the whole movie is so organic, you feel that you've lived it through it with all the characters.|Fresh
The Happiest Place on Earth can be wherever you want it to be. And I know now that should never be taken for granted.|Fresh
A brilliantly dark social conscience heartbreaking comedy gem about dealing with the corruption of innocent children.|Fresh
Surely [Brooklyn Pierce] will be one of Hollywood's great performers. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
We don't often see these people in movies, especially in American movies. We see them in the background, hustling, hawking, stealing, serving, providing - as we do in real life.|Fresh
Cinema in its purest form. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is the remarkable performance from the little Prince that propels the film forward.|Fresh
Baker follows these characters through a series of neo-realist episodes, in their absolute precariousness and in their most contagious freedom. (Complete review in newspaper Reforma, in Spanish)|Fresh
Sean Baker's portrait of working-class Americana is powerfully narrated and beautifully performed.|Fresh
Without a trace of sentimentality, it chronicles the carefree innocence of childhood even as the children intuit that there are no easy answers to the problems they face.|Fresh

An unusual and endearing comedy... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With a visual language based on vignettes and with explosive colors, [director Sean] Baker builds a hilarious, exhilarating film, full of warmth and candor... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The narrative speaks from its realism. is not frivolous and its ending is a perfect explosion of feelings. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
I rented this film mainly because of the Academy Award nomination for Willem Dafoe, who plays motel manager Bobby in this film. He is every bit as good as you would expect for such an honor, but it is the kids who steal the show in this film.|Fresh
The pathos of the film proves to be gut-wrenching|Fresh
It joins Moonlight in a new pantheon of Florida-based cinema defined by harsh reality and beautiful sunsets.|Fresh
Another great Sean Baker piece that finds a way to make a heartbreaking story about poverty into a bittersweet adventure as told through through the precocious eyes of a Moonee and her mother Halley.|Fresh
...a misbegotten endeavor that's as pointless as it is infuriating.|Rotten
[Wilem] Dafoe gives a warm performance as the harassed but decent manager.|Fresh
Despite the sunny Florida skies, Baker shows how easily harsh realities can darken lives. The last scene of this thought-provoking film is heartrending.|Fresh
... some of the most compelling, realistic, and lovable (despite the fact that they are objectively little monsters) protagonists in any film last year.|Fresh
Baker has made a movie that cuts out the melodrama of after-school specials and found the profound contemplation lurking underneath.|Fresh

Sean Baker returns to show us in The Florida Project those characters who live in the abandoned corners of splendor, who survive as they can in a society that has forgotten them... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Compassionately told through the eyes of a child, [the film] is a captivating observational drama filled with moments of incredible sadness, wide-eyed innocence and pure joy.|Fresh
The film could be used as an educational tool for governments unconvinced of the importance of effective social support networks.|Fresh
As he demonstrated in Tangerine, Baker has a fine way with actors. Here, he is especially good with children. Brooklynn Prince, as the six-year-old Moonee, is astonishing.|Fresh
Infused with the love for the often-disregarded members of society,it's obvious that Baker has a genuine appreciation for the mistreated subjects he focuses on.|Fresh
An honest, accessible, compassionate account of low-rent troubles and tussles - a tale that's tender, tragic and joyous with a knockout ending that's both devastating and beautiful.|Fresh
The best film of 2017.|Fresh
Heir to the traditions of Huck Finn, the 'Our Gang' shorts and other tales of feral children, Sean Baker's 'Tangerine' followup transforms the strip malls and short-term motels of Disneyfied Orlando into a magical playground of discovery and peril.|Fresh
One of the year's most riveting, beautifully shot and well-acted films. It's a heartfelt look at the lives of the downtrodden.|Fresh
A reverse-Spielberg view of being a kid. No alien buddies, cuddly friends or otherworldly adventures. But there is still magic.|Fresh
With his first three films filmmaker Sean Baker has managed to present slices of life from the underbelly of society that are often if not completely overlooked.|Fresh
It's triumph is its determined optimism, even if it admits that is probably a fantasy. It's a tale of the fallen who, like Moonee's favourite tree, keeps on growing regardless.|Fresh
The Florida Project is a remarkable movie.|Fresh
Beautiful and heartbreaking. Sean Baker outdoes himself with one of the best films of 2017. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Exuberant, empathetic and impassioned.|Fresh
Baker presents all this without poor-shaming, without being overtly political and without lecturing, but there's a real rage at the state of America -- and it's this balance that makes The Florida Project special.|Fresh
Little Moonee is innocent in every sense that counts, and even her worst misdeeds are fuelled by excitement at the possibilities of life.|Fresh
A marvelous bittersweet film about the endearing naivety of childhood and the reality that gravitates around it threatening to end it all at once. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
So beautiful, heartbreaking and unassumingly masterful from beginning to end, The Florida Project is undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2017.|Fresh
An unforgettable whisper of fresh air among the stepping-stones of reality|Fresh
The Florida Project is a fantastic piece of writing, a showcase for a couple of breakout performances... and a film we will be hearing a lot more about as award season gets into swing.|Fresh
The world captured by Sean Baker's lens is colourful and bright, despite its impoverished inhabitants, and he never judges or pities them for their choices, even if you might. Here is a movie that shows, not tells.|Fresh
"Heartbreaking and humane, ""The Florida Project"" is one of most stirring movies you'll see this year."|Fresh
... riveting mix of exhilaration and dread, right up to its pitch-perfect conclusion.|Fresh
The Florida Project is a worthy follow-up to Sean Baker's groundbreaking 2015 film Tangerine, also co-written with Chris Bergoch.|Fresh
"Sean Baker's dramatically infused [ethnographic] study of poverty in Kissimmee, ""The Florida Project"" remains a moving encapsulation of an escalating human crisis in America."|Fresh
Unique is too small a word to describe the filmmaking somersaults Sean Baker has achieved with this excellent coming of age story.|Fresh
Ending on an unusual note, The Florida Project may take a little time to sink in but it's a commanding character study that will hopefully open eyes.|Fresh
There isn't much of a narrative going on here, but Baker succeeds in enveloping the viewer in a very particular place.|Fresh
Enormously compassionate; joyous and funny, incisive and surprising, and truly subversive ... manages to be furious about the state of affairs in the United States while never raising its voice nor venturing near any political imagery.|Fresh
Sean Baker's latest avoids being an exploitative portrayal of poverty by empathetically portraying its characters' daily struggles, and giving time to a variety of perspectives.|Fresh
"A film not for the faint-hearted, easily-offended or frequently irritated by ""kids these days"", Florida is nonetheless a vibrant and vital slice of modern American cinema."|Fresh
The Florida Project is a funny, tragic, anarchic, hypercolour slice of life, and I loved it.|Fresh
Notably, however, Baker has no interest in making a screed against neglectful parents, poor-shaming these bedraggled families as somehow the agents of their own destruction.|Fresh
A scripted drama with the unflinching, unjudging eye of a documentary...|Fresh
It was equal parts whimsical child fantasy and very real adult drama. It simultaneously broke my heart and opened my eyes.|Fresh
Bittersweet and heartbreaking; words can't describe the simultaneous emotional devastation and wide-smiled happiness induced by the ending|Fresh
A refreshing, intimate look at the kind of people that Trump voters dislike.|Fresh
One of those films that makes you feel like you're eavesdropping on others' lives. It's raw and authentic, heartbreaking and funny, profoundly humane.|Fresh
One of the greatest films of the year.|Fresh
There's an abundance of authenticity up on the screen, which ensures that you don't know what's coming until it happens, and you don't know how hard it'll hit you until it already has.|Fresh
... The Florida Project is a film with an abundance of heart, one which highlights and commends relentless perseverance, but which recognises that... the shiny, exciting aspects of capitalist life often work to hide its victims...|Fresh
The emotional payoff is so incredibly worth your time.|Fresh
That discovery comes slowly, but inexorably, and in Baker's talented hands, ends up feeling - at the film's end - both like an act of love ... and a punch to the heart.|Fresh
The Florida Project is filmmaking at its most pure; a simple story, affectingly told by characters that leave you aching.|Fresh
Baker's work with his largely inexperienced cast is relaxed and playful, and the film's tone is fairly assured.|Fresh
As in many of Sean Baker's films, The Florida Project's final destination doesn't quite captivate as much as the journey taken to get there.|Fresh
It's all about the enchantments to be found in the margins of America's moribund entertainment empire -- which makes it sound heavy, but it's not.|Fresh
The Florida Project is not a sentimental film and never fetishises its protagonists' poverty. It's oddly beautiful though, lingering over the sun-dappled highlights of a childhood that's about to go bad.|Fresh
This beautifully shot, smartly-written and wonderfully-cast drama is grim and joyful in equal measures.|Fresh
Another superbly sympathetic portrait of marginalised experience from a film-maker whose great triumph is that he never feels like a tourist. This is Moonee's world, and for a couple of hours at least, we are privileged to live in it.|Fresh
For Moonee and her friends, The Magic Castle is more than a castle-it's the Magic Kingdom.|Fresh
The audience is invited to believe that their lives are devoid of thoughts and motivations beyond hustle and pleasure, and so the movie ends up feeling like a millennial Instagram feed: cute, edgy, explosive, pithy, but shallow.|Rotten
The Magic Kingdom colors almost every scene of The Florida Project. Sean Baker's achingly beautiful and heartbreaking new film.|Fresh
This is a compassionate film about the conditions of working class America, where the next knock on the door might well be from a child welfare agency.|Fresh
The camera, if especially respectful towards the children, refuses to demonise any of the characters.|Fresh
A life-affirming celebration of individuals determined to make the most of life.|Fresh
One of the most memorable pictures I've seen all year.|Fresh
The combination of the worldly wise Bobby and the cheekily innocent Moonee is its charming heart.|Fresh
This is a film fully attuned to the way kids find beauty all around them and Baker does remarkable work with his young cast.|Fresh
The Florida Project, director Sean Baker captures that cautious ethereality of Moonee's constructed universe against the harsh reality of transient families living in a highway motel in the shadow of The Happiest Place on Earth.|Fresh
There is something real and pressing in this vision that requires us to remain attuned to the plights of people like Moonee and Halley.|Fresh
It may not be an easy piece of work to digest at times, but the emotions it's able to conjure will hit you with an unavoidable force.|Fresh
The Florida Project absolutely sings as a visual achievement, and not only as that.|Fresh
The Florida Project is one of the best films about childhood made anywhere in recent years.|Fresh
[It's] so simplistic and repetitious that it could have easily summed up its story as a short film, especially a documentary. Which is to say that this could have been something special in that form, and that in this form, it needed serious editing.|Rotten
With most films you know what you are getting within the first ten minutes -- oh, it's this film; OK -- but here there are no plot points as such and we never quite know where we're headed, which gives it the thrum of real life.|Fresh
Both deeply human and sublime.|Fresh
Vibrant portrait that shows us from a child's point of view how play and enthusiasm can be ways to survive poverty.|Fresh
The film's sympathetic eye ensures it doesn't exoticise the family's plight, or dip into poverty porn. Drunken brawls, pissed-off johns and vicious catfights are simply day-to-day eruptions here, blowing in and out of the motel like the Florida weather.|Fresh
A summation about the power of The Florida Project feels trite - just go to see it.|Fresh
The Florida Project is a song of innocence and of experience: mainly the former.|Fresh
Vibrant and brimming with vitality, this is empathic towards its subjects but fiercely critical of the system that victimises them.|Fresh
It's a celebration of the camaraderie and optimism of people whose lives could be seen from the outside as desperate or sad.|Fresh
The Florida Project is magic in the real.|Fresh
The Florida Project is ultimately a beautiful, rough portrait of childhood set against the backdrop of the remains of the dreams of adults, which, like so many Florida oranges, have become overripe and rotten.|Fresh
For the most part what you get here are raw, non-star performances combined with knockout neon visuals.|Fresh
It's swallowed up by a style-over-substance approach increasingly at odds with its subject matter.|Rotten
Poverty and poetry, delinquency and deluxe wonder... this child's-eye view of lives on a knife-edge is terrific.|Fresh
It seems more casually curious and at times even exploitative in its attempt to center the narrative of a poor, marginalized single mother and her precocious young daughter.|Rotten
It's a great idea for a story that's been plucked too soon and put up on screen before the details in the script had a chance to ripen.|Rotten
There are storytelling issues that aren't resolved, but Baker largely gets by on atmosphere and periodic screen poetry, finding an original location to sort through troubled people.|Fresh
[Florida Project] is two hours of grit, outrage, and beauty.|Fresh
Transform[s] the tacky plaster eyesores despoiling the marshy landscape into almost painfully beautiful tableaux of color, lines, and ethereal fantasy.|Fresh
An astounding achievement that looks like nothing else on screens this year (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
It's a heartbreaking world, and a hard one, set in a place that charges by the day because that's how life is lived.|Fresh
Sean Baker is so skilled at making ugliness appear beautiful, I'd love to turn him loose on some of my childhood photos.|Fresh
Superb acting by the children, Bria Vinatie as Halley, and a terrific Willem Dafoe as Bobby makes a difficult film engaging. It takes courage to present this tragic struggle with poverty -- and some fortitude for the audience to confront it.|Fresh
It is at turns charming but unsettling, amusing but poignant, care-free but thought-provoking. But the real story here is Brooklynn Prince, a 6-year-old star in the making.|Fresh
...finds the beauty in a scruffy part of Florida that the tourist board would probably prefer that you ignore.|Fresh
... a funny, gut-wrenching, emotionally complex masterwork of the human condition that exudes warmth and humility in every frame.|Fresh
Quite simply, one of the best films about childhood ever made.|Fresh
You'll weep for these kids and try to hope for their future.|Fresh
Frankly, today, what six-year old do you see walking around without a parent? Social Services would be called immediately.|Fresh
[An] engaging, humane little movie ...|Fresh
Sleazy and shrill, it exploits the bleak, anti-social underbelly of economic inequality around The Magic Kingdom - emerging as perhaps the most depressing film of the year.|Rotten
Your heart will break, but it will also swell.|Fresh
Mr. Dafoe turns in his best, most touching performance in years.|Fresh
Never before have I seen [Dafoe] display the particular emotions that he displays in this film.|Fresh
I can't think of a movie that better captures the evanescent joy and freedom of childhood than The Florida Project.|Fresh
A wonderfully humane, heartbreakingly kind film.|Fresh
One of the most transcendent big-screen stories of the year comes in the pint-sized package of Moonee (Brooklynn Kimberly Prince).|Fresh
Youngsters named Moonee (the divine Brooklynn Prince), Scooty and Jancey become those mischievous and usually unsupervised little rascals all over again.|Fresh
How can one of the most joyful films of the year also be one of the saddest?|Fresh
The best, most heartbreakingly inspiring film of the year.|Fresh
[Brooklyn] Prince-with considerable help from her costars, Baker, and screenwriter Chris Bergoch-resonates beyond the twee and cute. At the film's climax, Prince delivers a performance that would make even the surliest curmudgeon cry.|Fresh
Director Sean Baker's sun-drenched, pastel-colored drama has a vibrant energy even amid the most heartbreaking moments|Fresh
The Florida Project is painfully good. [Sean] Baker has arrived.|Fresh
The world of The Florida Project feels tangible, lyrical, forbidding and magical all at once, a boundaryless playground for kids and a quicksand prison for everyone else.|Fresh
... a truly magnificent effort from director Sean Baker and cowriter Chris Bergoch.|Fresh
The Florida Project is certainly lively, but it is anything but redemptive. In spite of its episodic documentary quality, it traces an overdetermined downward spiral.|Fresh
Sean Baker's effortlessly headlong dive into a child's imagination is a tender thunderclap... generous, grand, gorgeous... ground-level magic.|Fresh
Director Sean Baker's luminous odyssey overflows with wit and joy.|Fresh
The Florida Project is a poetic mass of contradictions, a delicately graceful and harrowingly gritty drama that presents an innocent child's-eye view of a troubled adult world, a place of heartbreak and poverty in the shadow of the Magic Kingdom.|Fresh
Baker places no dramatic emphasis on any individual scene, granting a sense of wide-eyed wonder to major and minor events alike.|Fresh
Rarely has such a heartbreakingly innocent portrait of childhood been portrayed on film.|Fresh
Undeniably essential viewing.|Fresh
The performances by the children, especially (Brooklyn) Prince, are magical and unforgettable. You will think of them long after you leave the theater.|Fresh
The fluid visuals are a perfect match for the curiosity and exuberance of the kids, who prowl the motel grounds and beyond on the hunt for mischief.|Fresh
Baker never succumbs to the sirens of miserabilism. Instead, he prefers the fanciful fantasy of the children who, in their flight forward, can glean moments of happiness for themselves from the simple light of a blue sky.|Fresh
A three-dimensional microcosm of the millions of families denied their share of the American dream by a corrupt system that tends to only reward the rich.|Fresh
This is a story told with authenticity and power, helped along by its cast of newcomers.|Fresh
The Florida Project, despite its ability to marvel at the natural wonders that offset poverty-stricken circumstances, doesn't sugarcoat harsh realities.|Fresh
For all that kitschy beauty, I wouldn't want to spend one more minute with Moonee, here or anywhere else.|Rotten
One surprising thing about The Florida Project is how rife it is with hope, even as it's weighed down by the hapless, unsustainable situation of its protagonists.|Fresh
These people aren't living the American dream. They're barely making do. But still, The Florida Project suggests that our most precious relationships are held together with some undefinable, beautiful glue.|Fresh
It's film that'll make you wince at times, and you'll most likely not want to see twice, but seeing it once is an experience you'll not soon forget.|Fresh
This movie puts the wild, comic tales of resourceful poor kids into a frame, pulling back just enough to make it clear that the situation Moonee's in - while exciting - is untenable.|Fresh
The Florida Project is not just a downer, although parts of it are harrowing. The young lead actors are funny and vivacious, speaking with unaffected charisma and honesty.|Fresh
Alexis Zabe's rapturous cinematography reminds us that magic is where you find it. You don't need a golden ticket to Mickey's kingdom, although you can see it from here.|Fresh
Baker has made a surprisingly joyous film from this despairing situation...|Fresh
A fascinating look at lives lived on the fringe|Fresh
As Bobby, the saintly, suffering bastard who keeps order, Dafoe is like a new man.|Fresh
The sun-washed reality of The Florida Project, which concludes with a touch of poetry that might break you in two. It's not a happy ending, but it is, like the rest of the film, pretty much perfect.|Fresh
Dafoe delivers his finest performance in recent memory, bringing to levelheaded, unsanctimonious life a character who offers a glimmer of hope and caring within a world markedly short on both.|Fresh
The Florida Project may seem to have more episodes than a narrative through line, but that seems also true to the occupants of the Magic Kingdom, who believe they're simply in a transitional state while they're actually stuck in idle.|Fresh
Its humanist depiction of families on the fringe of society - an experience that is too often erased from the narrative we tell ourselves about the place where we live - makes it essential viewing.|Fresh
Dafoe has never had a role this warm and sweet, and he plays it for low-keyed honesty. The kids and the adults, some non-professionals, all become part of a bright purple beehive.|Fresh
Rarely in a movie will you want a character to succeed more than Moonee. Yet Baker doesn't sugarcoat the odds, which, despite eventual moments of real magic, remain long indeed.|Fresh
It may be impossible to overstate just how wonderful Willem Dafoe is in this film.|Fresh
"""The Florida Project"" is - in nerve, guts, heart, and mind - one of the finest films of 2017."|Fresh
... perfectly set up and disappointingly executed story about down-on-their-luck folks who call a motel in Orlando home.|Fresh
The Florida Project is perceptive to the charm and strength of character you can find in humble places.|Fresh
Dafoe's performance as Bobby is superb, a guardian angel for the 21st century.|Fresh
Baker & Bergoch's examination of the low class and welfare lifestyle in Florida is eye opening and at times hard to watch.|Fresh
A tattered tale about kids growing up in an American economy barely afloat offshore Florida's signature tourism mecca, making their own magic in the shadow of the Magic Kingdom.|Fresh
These characters are the detritus left behind by a 21st-century America with increasingly less room for the poor and undereducated. The Florida Project never looks at them with pity, only understanding and sympathy.|Fresh
The impression is a disturbing film of energy and compassion that left me with an inescapable sadness, from which director Baker offers no way out.|Fresh
As it stands, there's a greatness in it, but also stretches of emptiness. Still, this is an original piece of work, and no one who sees it will forget it.|Fresh
The Florida Project represents a new low in class condescension. . .[Director] Baker loves irresponsible, antisocial types, and his method is similarly undisciplined.|Rotten
The Florida Project is tonally playful while in fact being a wondrously sad piece of art.|Fresh
"Nothing ""HAPPENS"" in ""The Florida Project"" but lots of stuff ""happens"" as we live with Moonee, her mom and her friends in a world that is both modern and retro at once."|Fresh
There is no other film quite like it, this year or any other.|Fresh
Willem Dafoe knows from tortured roles (Platoon, The Last Temptation of Christ), but this creation -- a delicate blend of protector, fusspot and secret survivor -- is his richest, most lovable piece of work.|Fresh
This is a deeply humanist filmmaker, and he's sympathetic to these characters, flaws and all.|Fresh
Few movies about children capture the very essence of youth, the precious intersection of innocence and wonder that so often co-exists along the margins of a darker reality.|Fresh
The Florida Project is spattered with profound sadness, with moments of externalized, violent frustration at presumed helplessness, at practically being born into all this.|Fresh
Baker has imbued this whole terrific movie with a child's sense of discovery - the sort that can turn a decrepit, pastel corner of Orlando into a vibrant cinematic playground.|Fresh
It is because Baker views the world without blinders that the moments of lyricism in The Florida Project are so piercing. When a rainbow shows up in the sky, it's not just a rainbow; it's a benediction.|Fresh
The film ends on a fantastical note that is jarring in its change in tone, yet provocative in what it has to say...a humanistic work of art that lingers.|Fresh
The Florida Project is eye-opening, unconventional, sweet, scary, odd and heartbreaking. It's a fantastic movie, one I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it.|Fresh
...a triumphant exercise in cinematic empathy that also serves as a subversive societal challenge.|Fresh
"...a style of filmmaking that feels almost like an Errol Morris documentary (""Vernon, Florida"" comes to mind). It's pretty magical."|Fresh
The Florida Project is one of this year's best films, a remarkable slice of life. If ever there were a sleeper deserving of wide recognition, this is it.|Fresh
The Florida Project is by no stretch an easy watch, but it's an incredibly rewarding one.|Fresh
Dafoe's sensitive performance anchors the movie's slippery adult world, and Baker builds a cinematic mood beautifully; the strip malls and swampland and buzzing cicadas on screen feel as real and tactile as the theater seat beneath you.|Fresh
Though Moonee's story may not have a Hollywood happy ending when she's grown and the world has been cruel, Baker has created an indomitable character who's at least got a fighting chance.|Fresh
It is impossible not to fall a little bit in love with The Florida Project.|Fresh
"The Florida Project achieves something rare and magical: presenting existence from the perspective of a young child while, at the same time, providing enough ""clues"" that viewers are able to decipher what's really going on."|Fresh
"All childhoods must come to an end, few of them as piercingly as the one in ""The Florida Project,"" Sean Baker's raw, exuberant and utterly captivating new movie."|Fresh
As in previous films, Mr. Baker mixes amateur and professional actors to exceptional effect.|Fresh
Director Sean Baker crafts one of the best and toughest films about childhood ever and gives a never-better Willem Dafoe a clear shot at an Oscar.|Fresh
To balance joy and desperation as gracefully as Mr. Baker does - to interweave giddiness and heartbreak - is no easy feat.|Fresh
Written and directed with rich texture by Sean Baker, The Florida Project, which just debuted at the New York Film Festival ahead of its release this week in theaters, is the latest in a vivid, intensely naturalistic new subgenre of white-trash cinema.|Fresh
The pleasure of The Florida Project is that we lose ourselves in Moonee's Eden: its aesthetics; its logic.|Fresh
The Florida Project is both radiant and unsentimental.|Fresh
... Dafoe's warm and generous performance is simply astonishing.|Fresh
This is a film of rare joy, even in its more unsparing moments, and the kind of film that should be seen by anybody who loves movies.|Fresh
Sean Baker's beautiful heartbreaker scratches just below the cheery lilac and bubblegum pink to expose the layers of privation festering in this sunshiny state.|Fresh
Shots are held just long enough for us to ponder all the details; strong closeups bring the characters' emotions uncomfortably near.|Fresh
Sean Baker's latest is a melancholy slice of wonder, viewed through our pint sized protagonist's eyes.|Fresh
The Florida Project lights us onto an authentic perspective, never shying away from the grime and sorrow of its world, but never making it the film's unyielding focal point, either.|Fresh
Baker's neo-realistic eye for humour, honesty and heartbreak has crafted a slow burn, potent commentary on America's struggling underclass.|Fresh
