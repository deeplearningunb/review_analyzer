A fascinating and intoxicating tale of cannibalism that examines the savage sexual awakening of a shy adolescent, whose complex psychology and inner struggle are described with great delicacy. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This simmering sense of dread is part of what makes [director Julia] Ducornau's debut work so well, as the feeling that Justine's carnal needs know no limits creeps around throughout the film.|Fresh
Raw is the kind of disgustingly funny movie where you will be unsure if you should laugh or vomit.|Fresh
Director Julia Ducournau deftly weaves sexuality and gruesome horror together in her coming-of-age film Raw.|Fresh
Raw is a beautifully told tale that is gruesome and, as a woman, very familiar.|Fresh
Will prove difficult to swallow for most, what with its unblinking depiction of human-on-human consumption, but those with a stomach of steel will be treated to a shockingly delicious slice of cannibal-horror fare.|Fresh
Raw can appeal to the bloodthirsty gorehounds and the cineastes that want more than just excessive blood and guts.|Fresh
Clear your mind, eat a weed gummie, and trust Ducournau to take you on a bloody journey through one young woman's adolescent hellscape. It's fun! Trust me.|Fresh
All the Cronenberg and New French Extremity tributes in the world aren't going to hide a metaphoric sense of storytelling that is, at its core, rather unchallenging.|Fresh

Ferocious and flawless, Raw grips you from the get go and doesn't spit you out until the bitter end. Simply incredible.|Fresh
The horror here isn't limited to expectations about women's bodies and the self-destructive things women do as a response, but it starts there. It ends up far beyond there, in a wickedly comic exploration of family ties.|Fresh
Ducournau's script is filled with these kinds of witty observations about female sexuality and agency.|Fresh
It often takes decades for filmmakers to strike the right sense of balance Ducournau has achieved with Raw, and she is a director and writer with a formidable grasp.|Fresh
A film like Raw is a refreshing reminder that new directors are not afraid to give us civilization at its roots, with a sly wink and grin. For the faint of heart it might be too much, but then again human nature can always be a bit too much.|Fresh
Like the standard superhero movie, Raw ultimately equates profundity and meaning with world building... Unfortunately, it's not about the characters but the grandiose themes they come to represent on the surface.|Rotten
It's a mesmerising film that leaves you filled with discomfort. Justine's journey of self discovery walks a twisted path.|Fresh
This stylishly, dark, perverse. Gallic, coming-of-age horror pic is too arty to be considered merely an exploitation film--but it's close.|Fresh
If the Insidiouses and Sinisters and Conjurings of horror cinema have you bored, check out this bloody French treat.|Fresh
A film of young feminine growth... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The performances are quite good, the footage keeps the interest from beginning to end... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Garance] Marillier gives a fearless performance, seeming to age at least 10 years as the movie goes on, and the tense relationship with her wilder older sister feels authentic.|Fresh
And yet, abetting Raw's piecemeal feel is Jim Williams' scattershot score that is, at times, classical, vaguely industrial, and at one moment, pop. It even gooses you with blaring volume concurrent with crucial moments of sex and violence.|Fresh
Writer/director Julia Ducournau's arty horror/coming-of-age film takes viewers along for Justine's descent-slash-awakening into the carnal.|Fresh
All praise for the storytelling and direction aside, the meatiest portion of Raw comes from Garance Marillier, expressing a multitude of personality shifts as she comes to terms with herself in more ways than one|Fresh
"""Raw"" will be a difficult movie for many viewers. For those who can stomach it, however, it is rewarding - and certainly unforgettable."|Fresh
Ducournau gives Justine full reign to be vile, smart, and even kinky, making her fall from grace all the more thrilling to watch.|Fresh
A film that keeps us attentive to know what will happen in the end, but that doesn't have bigger surprises. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
It's a terribly good snapshot of being a teenage girl arriving at college and being totally overstimulated... and it's also a terribly good schlocky horror film.|Fresh
How do you live with yourself once you've crossed a point of no return? Raw displays a haunting hesitancy in its reply|Fresh
Its tonal combination won't be for everyone, but for those who roll with its depravity and perverse humour, you'll find one of the most memorable and wickedly brilliant film experiences of the year.|Fresh
Raw marks a debut in which director Julia Ducournau delivers a blood-stained calling card you won't soon forget.|Fresh
Ducournau starts from a great premise, a great atmosphere, defined characters, and then doesn't know how to condense them into a round movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Beyond what can provoke and what can make us reflect, this is an entertaining work of careful manufacture for fans of the rare. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Marillier's command of her character is such that the creepiest shot in the film doesn't involve any blood or body parts; instead, it's Justine sitting in a corner at a house party.|Fresh
Raw is a bizarre, sexy film with a healthy dose of humor about itself.|Fresh
The film's skilfully engineered intensity isn't for the squeamish.|Fresh
Whether Raw will be welcomed by mainstream horror fans is still unknown, but Ducournau has crafted something that beautiful yet brutal and in main star Marillier a performance that's as elegant as it is vicious.|Fresh
From hot new French director Julia Ducournau comes a new breed of hybrid horror that draws on convention yet doesn't have a cliche in sight.|Fresh
Retch Ed.|Rotten
[Raw contrasts] a craving for meat with a craving for carnality in a way that few American movies dare (but European horror films love).|Fresh
The picture justifies the feminist analyses it will inevitably generate. It also offers much disgusting fun.|Fresh
Julie Ducournau's Raw is a great piece of genre filmmaking and is one of the most impressive debut features that has been released recently.|Fresh
Absolutely vital viewing... you're going to want to consume every last morsel of Ducournau's film.|Fresh
Some may claim the film is about a young woman discovering herself, but the writer-director's obvious delight in shock for shock's sake constitutes a major turn-off, no matter how efficiently made or well acted the film may be.|Rotten
You might not lose your lunch, but you'll probably find something to chew over.|Fresh
A shocking and obligated experience for cinema lovers. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's viscous, and vicious, a twisted, oddly poignant collision of midnight-movie yucks and coming-of-age turmoil.|Fresh
I'm not entirely sure what Raw was intending to convey - veterinarians are evil? Vegetarians are liars? College students are jerks? - but unlike the eye-licking, its lack of direction is far from a deal-breaker with this fun body-horror romp.|Fresh
This is intelligent, metaphorically rich horror that will have you pondering (and perhaps considering vegetarianism) long after you've left the cinema.|Fresh
I am thrilled beyond measure to be witness to the cinematic birth of a new, young voice in articulate, emotionally rich, cinematically rigorous horror cinema ... a mesmerising, totally compelling - and, yes, grisley - thrill ride.|Fresh
It is not often we get to see a horror film as audaciously confronting and worryingly clever as Raw.|Fresh
Cinema as a punch in the gut and not for the squeamish, casting female desire as ravenously predatory in a way that few films have ever had the audacity to do.|Fresh
An experience with the same doses of intelligence as of emotion and restlessness. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Marillier, quivering with fearfulness and then flush with rapt pleasure when she indulges, never merely becomes a ravenous cannibal. Her startled humanity burns through.|Fresh
Raw is both good and gross, meaning it can live up to its reputation as The Flick That Keeps Making People Pass Out or Vomit and still stand up to actual artistic scrutiny.|Fresh
The unholy offspring of John Hughes and David Cronenberg, an unforgettably morbid dramedy from a distinct new talent.|Fresh
Ducournau's clinical eye for horror tableaux ... keep Raw perpetually and satisfyingly unnerving.|Fresh
This is cleverly written and directed by debut filmmaker Julia Ducournau, really well acted by its young stars and while definitely somewhere in the horror genre, it has elements of thriller, sexual politics and proper coming-of-age drama.|Fresh
Directed with the same cross-genre dexterity as Kathryn Bigelow's seminal vampire western Near Dark, Raw is a thrillingly confident and vigorously executed work.|Fresh
Julia Ducournau's feature debut Raw has been described as one of the most unsettling horror films ever made, but there's a whole lot more to it than that. It gets under your skin from the word go.|Fresh
It's savage but heartfelt, gruesome but wickedly funny, and as Justine is forced to find her own way through this nightmare, it's moving too. This is essential viewing.|Fresh
This chilling and intense coming-of-age horror exerts a powerful grip. Even if you're not especially faint-of-stomach, you'll re-think going out for steak afterwards.|Fresh
The intelligent, deliciously repellent Raw stays with you long after the sight of a nice trainee vet snacking on a fellow student's severed finger has gone.|Fresh
Ducournau possesses a real gift for conjuring up unsettling, creepily memorable imagery.|Fresh
Genre fans with strong stomachs will find this a memorably tasty morsel. Those with more delicate dispositions should probably wait for the American remake.|Fresh
A bracing and brilliant original, with a delicious script and meaty performances.|Fresh
Its power - its shuddering, relentless intensity - lies in the way it makes you vicariously feel both her dual hungers, and surreptitiously relish every sticky, illicit bite.|Fresh
There's also artistry here. And the arthouse crowd with open minds and strong stomachs should take note.|Fresh
Bloody, bonkers and brilliant.|Fresh
The plot lurches from gross-out to gross-out with little wit and less logic.|Rotten
The shock tactics can verge on the prurient but even in the most extreme moments, the film never loses sight of character.|Fresh
The film has an alluring lexicon of moods: luminous, glossy, animalistic, pastoral. If not for the trail of corpses left behind, this might be reminiscent of other dreamy European coming-of-age narratives.|Fresh
Works equally well as an intimate adolescent psychodrama than as a horror film, full of moments not suitable for sensitive stomachs. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
goes outside the norm of what we would consider body horror|Fresh
A mesmerising, horrendously uncomfortable film that lingers on every single little moment. The cutting, the bitting, the scratching or the waxing - it's a visceral piece that you won't forget in a hurry.|Fresh
The classic child separation trauma of going off to college is given a rollicking new dimension in a splatter flick with a message.|Fresh
In the end, Raw turns out to be very well done as Ducournau serves up a tasty blend of gore, metaphor and mischief.|Fresh
A classy French-Belgian horror with an unusual female perspective on monstrous taboos. Shocking but not sensationalist, this is a strong cannibal movie worth chewing over.|Fresh
Raw ... exposes the everyday monstrousness each of us harbours within our soft, fragile exteriors, and the accommodations we have to make with our darker nature.|Fresh
If anything, Raw is almost too self-conscious about its metaphors; Ducournau is practically writing her own academic paper on Raw while she's unspooling the movie.|Fresh
The fact this complex, energetic and wholly entertaining film is a debut feature film is stunning. Raw is a gory gem of a film that you have to seek out.|Fresh
Marillier seamlessly transitions from cloistered nerd to hypersexed party wastrel, playing her discovery that she's a beautiful young woman who's too smart for her own good with the squirmy, frantic energy of a real-life teenager.|Fresh
Hunger has consequences.|Fresh
Buckle in for commentary on misogyny, patriarchy, female rivalry, vegetarianism, homosexuality, and nature vs. nurture. To name a few|Fresh
If your taste in horror runs toward the smart and sick, French filmmaker Julia Ducournau's disturbing feature debut, Raw, is a worthwhile kick in the gut.|Fresh
In the hands of writer-director Julia Ducournau, the film becomes a fascinating, metaphorical exploration of becoming an adult - or female sexuality, or animal rights, or something like that.|Fresh
"""Raw"" is a pretty picture and provocative to a certain degree, but it chooses to hold back on its ghastly potential, which might inspire some post-screening conversation, but no lingering scares."|Fresh
Its command of tone is constant, even in the film's darkly droll final moments, during which you may not know whether to laugh or gag.|Fresh
It's mainly about all the BS women have to put up with today, in the name of fitting in and growing up. The cannibalism's the extension, the logical end point, of the other stuff.|Fresh
A chronicle of an inner journey - with a final surprise - that maintains the balance in a risky dreamlike tone. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ducournau's school-days guignol, with all its faults, is still more intelligent and provocative than ninety percent of the junk out there.|Fresh
Raw feels unformed - a collage of partially realized ideas and moments that never gel.|Rotten
This French-language cannibal-horror movie reportedly made audiences in Cannes and Toronto vomit, pass out, and/or walk out; it's not really that bad, but it is playfully queasy and artfully gory.|Fresh
Raw is a film whose beauty is only revealed to those with a wide-open mind and an iron stomach.|Fresh
"A decadent casserole of brains and regurgitated -- let's just say ""stuff"" -- you can really sink your teeth into."|Fresh
Marillier is a great find. But French-Belgian body horror or more correctly food disorder horror film leaves a bad taste.|Rotten
It contains one of the grimmest, most disturbing acts on film. Nothing in Raw can top it, but Raw has an edginess that pervades, an unpredictability that draws and pulls you much in the same way Justine discovers her true gastronomical desires.|Fresh
The movie's allegorical aims are deep, but their impact is unfortunately slight...|Rotten
One of the most transgressive things about Raw is how Ducournau keeps the focus on the unjust judgment of others, rather than the shame Justine internalizes throughout.|Fresh
"You probably won't want to see ""Raw"" again anytime soon, but Ducournau's next cinematic smorgasbord can't come soon enough."|Fresh
Blending the irreverent humor and gory coming-of-age allegory... Raw is a unique and refreshing addition to cinema - and yet another example of France's remarkably artful and existential approach to horror.|Fresh
Raw's errant psychology is apt, acts and reactions escalate with finely-stitched logic, and, as in the best work of David Cronenberg, we simultaneously witness ruin and flowering transformation.|Fresh
Some people like their movie meals straight up, steak and potatoes and no funny business. But from where I'm sitting, there's nothing quite as tasty and chewable as a film with layers and secrets.|Fresh
Despite Raw being a movie that will test your gag reflexes, this smart and unsettling film by first-time writer/director Julia Ducournau knows what it's doing, and does it very well indeed.|Fresh
A tender coming-of-age tale, in all of its guts, pubes, and cannibalism.|Fresh
When Ducournau keeps the viewer off balance and doesn't lose her own, she shows signs of being an outstanding stylist and storyteller, balancing mood, composition, startling images, slow-burning suspense, and sardonic humor.|Fresh
...not for the faint of heart-particularly those who might get squeamish about watching a heart being eaten.|Fresh
I did not barf, but I did check my watch a few times.|Rotten
It is hard to think of a recent work of horror that mixes the lyrical with the horrific with the same effortless sense of style.|Fresh
Raw is a film with things to say about body image, finding your identity as a woman and adapting to life as a grown-up.|Fresh
Great female story of training with cannibal appetite and the new meat as a trunk subject to leave puberty behind. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In terms of the female-body politic, it's an art-horror dirty bomb.|Fresh
A credible candidate for the midnight-movie canon.|Fresh
The gory shock value tends to overwhelm the character-driven aspects of this low-budget French drama.|Rotten
Ducournau vividly illustrates a uniquely feminine body horror, both emotional and corporeal, rendered in vast, bold, dripping red strokes.|Fresh
Raw is the French cannibal sex movie to end all French cannibal sex movies, a truly fearless descent into total degradation. I recommend it highly.|Fresh
Raw is horrifying and gorgeous, with fantastic performances by Marillier, Rumpf, and Rabah Nait Oufella.|Fresh
Julia Ducournau's good girl coming-of-rage story succeeds as a raw portrait of a complicated, contradictory fully-realized contemporary young woman that invokes early Cronenberg body horror.|Fresh
Raw is about discovering your own appetites, your kinks, the secret joys that make you feel full.|Fresh
Ducournau's lurid, vivid film is visually striking, full of images that will shock you while others will lull you with a hypnotic beauty.|Fresh
A nimbly crafted bit of subversive horror.|Fresh
There are enough moments in Raw where the grand metaphor resonates .., to keep one emotionally invested throughout|Fresh
A humane cannibal film! Leave it to the French.|Fresh
Like It Follows (and, really, all good horror movies), Raw is more than just body horror. It is as much about the horror of the feminine body itself, as well as the horror of growing up.|Fresh
I'll spare you the graphic details, which is more than this fearlessly bizarre film does.|Fresh
Ducournau's movie is as tiresome as it is scandalous. Rather than tell a story, Raw merely administers a series of shocks.|Rotten
An exceptionally classy-looking movie about deeply horrifying behavior.|Fresh
Yes, it's true: this movie is gross as all hell. But it's also incredibly sharp, sensitive, and engaging, a coming-of-age story that everyone can relate to-minus, perhaps, a plot twist about eating human flesh.|Fresh
Think of it as Carrie meets Animal House meets Dawn of the Dead, with subtitles.|Fresh
Underneath all the blood and guts, this is the story of a woman whose body demands love in extremity and the only person who'll ever understand her fully: her sister.|Fresh
Sisterhood and sibling rivalry are turned inside-out in the strange, startling 'Raw,' a full-on, visceral moviegoing experience.|Fresh
Ducournau, making a stellar feature writing-directing debut, fosters the kind of disquieting intimacy with her characters that leaves us continually uncertain of whether we should fear them or fear for them.|Fresh
...a very intense horror film, one which uses its setting to unsettling degree.|Fresh
Come for the flesh eating; stay for the empathetic portrayal of autonomy through transgression.|Fresh
Deceptively soft, urgent, wet and pulsing with intellect and power. It feels dangerous. Exciting. Like an awakening. Like a birth.|Fresh
A great approach to cannibalism without falling into the excess, that has a well thought-out story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
For those with strong constitutions and an interest in understanding - if not necessarily forgiving - the darkest recesses of the soul, Raw is very well done.|Fresh
The grosser it grows, the less interesting it becomes. When the carnage was over, I went out and had a steak.|Rotten
Julia Ducournau exhibits a clinical pitilessness that's reminiscent of the body-horror films of David Cronenberg.|Fresh
A French-Belgian horror film that combines flesh eating with the horrors of college hazing to spin a loopy parable of abstinence and indulgence, bingeing and purging.|Fresh
Raw is a dreamy coming-of-age allegory, with plenty of subtext to chew on, as it shows the potential for monstrous transgression and human restraint that we all harbour within our developing bodies.|Fresh
A movie with situations and emotions ranging from laughter, fear, disgust and finally excitement. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
'Raw' is Riveting, Tense, and Absolutely Stunning...|Fresh
Garance Miller sells every [cannibalistic] bite with cringing authenticity.|Fresh
Beautiful and brutal.|Fresh
Made with precision and care: from a strictly filmmaking perspective, Ducournau has created an effectively visceral experience.|Fresh
"...it's atmospheric and full of nightmare visions, but you probably won't emerge saying, ""Wow, what a great story I just got told!"""|Fresh
A bold and fiercely unflinching debut for Ducournau, Raw absolutely left me wrecked (in the best possible way).|Fresh
This film with bloody sequences like 'Carrie', contributes to the solid, attractive and fun wave of new horror inspired by sex. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ducournau delivers an efficient and technically mastered (but one would not expect less from a Fémis graduate) variation on the cannibal flick, which manages to keep a few twists in store alongside the more expected final feast.|Fresh
Marillier and Rumpf sharing the screen has the air of a young Brie Larson going toe-to-toe with Betty Blue-era Béatrice Dalle, a toughened innocence clashing with fractured superiority.|Fresh
That realism and dedication to keeping it simple allows Justine's bloody rights of passage to transcend sadism and schlock into something singular and special.|Fresh
Pretty much everything about this movie clicked for me, from the candy-colored visuals to the incredible soundtrack... Raw is an unforgettable debut feature and a real highlight of this year's festival lineup.|Fresh
Ducournau eschews jump scares and instead focuses on tone, never allowing the audience to fully relax by peppering even what appear to be quotidian transition scenes with little reminders of the macabre.|Fresh
Raw is as lyrical a film about cannibalism as you are ever likely to see, so ignore the hype about audience members fainting or being sick, and instead revel in the strange beauty of its twisted tale.|Fresh
A cleverly written, impressively made and incredibly gory tale of one young woman's awakening to the pleasures of the flesh - in all senses of the term.|Fresh
Raw is realized to a high standard that should break it out beyond specialist distributors and exhibitors, and genre fests that can get in there before release should book it and watch audiences delight in its stylish sense of body horror.|Fresh
What is very impressive about Raw is that absolutely everything about it is disquieting, not just the obvious moments of revulsion: there is no let up in the ambient background buzz of fear.|Fresh
I've heard the patrons felled by Raw's more outré scenes, in a film filled with gaping flesh wounds and at least one sensual eyeball-licking, were men, which only underscores the film's power as a feminist fable.|Fresh
Not managing to be as icky as it wants to be, Raw makes one long for the days of exploitation films that compensate for the lack of technical craft with pure, idiotic chutzpah.|Rotten
An endurance test of a movie...|Rotten
A coming-of-age tale conveyed with deftly handled emotional complexity and chilling thematic subtext, Raw is above all else a gut twisting work of classic body horror.|Fresh
French writer-director Julia Ducournau's extraordinary first feature is a heady, blood-soaked examination of femininity, sexual awakening and the sisterly bond.|Fresh
Raw is filled with surreally Cronenberg-esque peeks at vet training within the brutalist walls of the campus building, from dog dissections to a horse running on a treadmill.|Fresh
The inventively grisly (or gristly) genre debut by French up-and-comer Julia Ducornau.|Fresh
