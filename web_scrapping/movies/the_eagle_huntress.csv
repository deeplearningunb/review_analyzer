I went in pumped up to see a girl-power/girl-falconer documentary with plenty of big, cool-looking birds, and I was not disappointed.|Fresh
A rousing effort filled with inspiration, yet told in a thoroughly routine fashion.|Fresh
The Eagle Huntress is an organic documentary made by a director who has an affinity for the serendipitous and an eye for on screen talent and scenery.|Fresh

Perhaps the director has fudged it a bit, but his intention was to make a beautiful film about one girl from a place and a culture we know little about. That he has done.|Fresh
Can we call this documentary, or is it some kind of hybrid, when so much of it is constructed for the camera?|Rotten
In The Eagle Huntress, we have a warm, inviting and highly atmospheric documentary that can be shared by the whole family.|Fresh
The jaw-dropping backdrop threatens to upstage both the human players and their barely-domesticated birds of prey.|Fresh
It's a visually exquisite film, a father-daughter love story and a must-see feminist fable for the whole family.|Fresh
Feminist by nature rather than design and consistently visually dazzling, The Eagle Huntress is top flight documentary cinema.|Fresh
This a beautiful and gentle documentary, well, except for a sacrificial killing of a goat and fox, and is filled with stunning landscapes.|Fresh
There's no doubt about the veracity of Aisholpan's inspirational story. She exists, and she's a champion in every sense. But many sequences in the film appear planned out, even staged.|Fresh
It's interesting, beautiful and Aisholpan and her dad are so sweet that it makes for lovely viewing.|Fresh
The footage used in Otto Bell's film is breathtaking, but unfortunately it's accompanied by an overbearing soundtrack and commentary that cheapen Aisholpan's achievements.|Fresh
DOP Simon Niblett's camera seems to fly over the steppe as dozens of eagle hunters gather for the national championship where this well-loved daughter and classic sports underdog must prove herself in a stirring contest.|Fresh
A must-see.|Fresh
If the girl-empowerment message is unsubtle, the chronology dubious and the occasionally staged action sometimes manipulative, the film also is quite moving, especially as the high-spirited girl develops her remarkable bond with her 15-pound bird.|Fresh
It's spectacular at best; watchable even at worst.|Fresh
A wondrously beautiful and beguiling journey into the unknown and a documentary of simultaneously mythic and very modern proportions.|Fresh
This lovely ode to change (which gets you thinking, not just about gender but all hierarchies) contains two powerful youngsters. It should really be called The Eaglet and her Girl.|Fresh

There's a long tradition of making stuff up in documentaries, so while The Eagle Huntress satisfies in the style of a Disney adventure movie... the pat story arcs [will] definitely raise some eyebrows.|Fresh
The Eagle Huntress is a remarkable documentary, one that combines superb National Geographic-style photography with a storyline that plays out like a real-life folktale with a feminist undertow.|Fresh
Part nature doco, part fly-on-the-wall look at local traditions (including elders who believe a girl's place is in the yurt), it's an empowering piece.|Fresh
It would take a cold heart not to feel some uplift from Aisholpan's game-changing triumph against the odds.|Fresh
