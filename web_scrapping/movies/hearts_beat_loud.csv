Hearts Beat Loud is one of those infectious, satisfying indie gems that comes around every so often and just works on nearly every level.|Fresh
There's magic to be found within this movie.|Fresh
Writer-director Brett Haley avoids turning this into a sappy fairytale by keeping the story grounded, which pays off big time in the end. Nick Offerman and Kiersey Clemons are terrific as the father-daughter duo who form a band.|Fresh
Quietly stirring, not grandly epic, and gratifyingly realistic. The plot avoids pie-in-the-sky clich√©s of stardom, and instead creates a beautiful father-daughter pair and gives us a glimpse into an important season of their lives.|Fresh
Beneath the feel good charms, there's an underlying melancholy that makes this highly contemporary portrayal of a father/daughter relationship more emotionally affecting than you'd otherwise expect.|Fresh
Offerman holds it all together with a performance as powerful as it is quiet.|Fresh
The filmmaking is as warm as the beats Sam programs, but for all the comforts in the storytelling, as well as new relationships for Frank and Sam, the movie reveals creativity as a way of saying goodbye.|Fresh
What a delightful film. So enjoyable and so fulfilling. It is sweet without being syrupy; it is hopeful without making promises.|Fresh
All in all, a diverting, endearing and unpretentious slice of life, carved out with real feeling and shrewd good taste.|Fresh
I guess you could say it's the same old song, but with a different meaning since it cast 'Ron'.|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud defines family film better than most movies claiming the title.|Fresh
...just might worm its way into your heart.|Fresh
Clemons and Offerman are unforgettable, each conquering the full spectrum of emotion to find common ground and the love to accept the other's choices.|Fresh
"Anyone who's written a song knows how much heart is poured across the sheet; Hearts Beat Loud actualizes that ""overflowing of spontaneous emotion."""|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud is a light, enjoyable film that washes over you - though perhaps doesn't linger in the mind long after the credits roll.|Fresh
This movie features not only a fun musical, but also a strong character piece. Fans of films like Sing Street and Begin Again are sure to like Hearts Beat Loud .|Fresh
This small film is one of the year's best, excessive sweetness and all.|Fresh
Offerman puts in a subtle turn beneath his humongous ageing-hipster beard and Clemons is deliciously natural as the exasperated Sam.|Fresh
A warm, unassuming film about hipster fathers and daughters bonding over their shared love of Wilco and Tom Waits, it has all the modest but catchy pleasures of a small summer hit.|Fresh
A slice of pure cinematic joy with Offerman and Clemons on top form.|Fresh
This is a film about first chances and second chances, first loves and later loves, but mainly it's about the transformative impact of making music.|Fresh
It's remarkable just how grating this perkily inoffensive premise manages to be.|Rotten
A delightful reminder that film as a medium can work wonders for exploring the world of music.|Fresh
Confection light, this is a perfect film for our long, hot summer that leaves a honeyed taste of warm nostalgia even as its specifics melt from the memory.|Fresh
Without very much happening, writer-director Brett Haley keeps it all ticking along very engagingly.|Fresh
Co-writer/director Brett Hayley mostly avoids falling into the mawkish traps and hipster one-upmanship this premise and setting all but invite.|Fresh
[Offerman and Clemons] and director/co-writer Brett Haley keep the story percolating - just.|Fresh
Dramatic tension may be in short supply but Hearts Beat Loud makes very pleasurable viewing precisely because it is so mellow and its very genial protagonists are so self-effacing.|Fresh
As parents, our souls live in those moments, and what a wonderful thing it is that Haley, Offerman, and Clemons have been able to bring that to life onscreen. That's real magic.|Fresh
Offerman is particularly skilled at this kind of thing, bringing out dry comedy, warm affection and some powerful but subtly expressed emotion.|Fresh
The camera loves Offerman's expressive eyes and Sam's beautiful, determined face. This is a coming-of-age film for dads as much as it is for daughters.|Fresh
Frank and Sam are lovely people to spend 90 minutes with; you just might not remember much about them afterward.|Fresh
An innocuous but earnest coming-of-age rock-band fantasy film.|Fresh
A lovely, interesting and thoughtful look at growing up and a nice side dish to typical summer blockbuster faire.|Fresh
A compulsively (and increasingly) watchable piece of work...|Fresh
It has an easygoing way about it that makes it easy to like a great deal, maybe even love it.|Fresh
Subtly sensitive and sincere, this beat has heart.|Fresh
The tension of competing dreams, the palpable affection father and daughter have for each other, and the indisputable desire for theother's happiness makes for a film that is heartbreaking and oddly joyful at the same time.|Fresh
Haley understands how to be earnest without being overly earnest.|Fresh
Courtesy of Offerman and Clemons, Hearts Beat Loud is a beautifully played study of the lengths to which any decent parent will go to make sure the kids are all right.|Fresh
"Haley's characters are real enough to make mistakes, to not live up to their ideas of themselves. It's in those little failings, and then whether the characters can recover from them, that ""Hearts Beat Loud"" finds its poignancy."|Fresh
Finds a satisfying rhythm by combining feel-good vibes with crabby comedy and family strife.|Fresh
Offerman is strong in his role, and Kiersey Clemons is a star in the making, if not already.|Fresh
Offerman is likable as ever, but it's asking a lot for him to carry a film, especially one without an ounce of urgency in the narrative.|Rotten
This is a film that oozes authenticity, making all that happens hit home in ways it never could have otherwise.|Fresh
Like I said, I enjoyed watching Hearts. It's just so intent in coloring within the lines, it never once springs any sort of surprise or observation you don't see coming.|Fresh
Not much happens, but it's awfully sweet. And I'll be honest: after I'll See You In My Dreams and The Hero, I wasn't expecting Brett Haley to ever make a movie this good, but I'm very happy he did.|Fresh
Offerman, if I haven't been clear enough, can do anything.|Fresh
That's what's so beautiful about the film - that it's not only so empathetic to both of their situations, but that it reaches deep into those mental states as well. And what it pulls out, the music that they share, is often mesmerizing.|Fresh
...the number one reason to see ... Hearts Beat Loud is the vibrant performance of Kiersey Clemons.|Fresh
One of the more heartwarming movies of the year, helped by top-notch original music and a pair of winning performances from Nick Offerman and Kiersey Clemons|Fresh
Despite the film's sweetness and comfortable familiarity, Haley's ambition has overwhelmed his ability.|Rotten
Haley engagingly traces the arc of the father-daughter relationship while deftly avoiding sentimentality. And he elicits fine performances from a splendid cast.|Fresh
While there are some weak platitudes delivered via dialogue, the film takes a refreshing look at queer relationships.|Fresh
To its even greater credit, things do not go where you might expect them to by the end, making this a fresh delight in a summer of pre-packaged predictability.|Fresh
It's a nice idea of a movie but doesn't use its time or cast wisely.|Rotten
"It's cute, it's ""quirky"" (ugh), and it's boring as hell, with hollow dialogue and a plot that shuffles along like an old, tired dog."|Rotten
Hearts Beat Loud touches on serious themes - financial hardship, broken dreams, grief and loss - but the movie's attitude is refreshingly buoyant.|Fresh
A sweet, slow-burn, the music themed movie never raises its drama level above a six. But without a lot of noise, it allows us into the lives of a father and daughter, who need to break free from each other.|Fresh
All of it all feels deeply honest, which, in this time of endless amounts of ridiculous onscreen nonreality, is highly refreshing.|Fresh
Adorable.|Fresh
Haley and Basch fuss and fuss over creating phony conflicts designed to keep father and daughter apart until it's time for them to finally find harmony.|Fresh
Intimacy rushes into the story with cool command: Haley is increasingly masterful with domestic tempos.... Haley hails toward its greatest virtues: the human face, the human voice, elemental longings.|Fresh
The film may never feel weighty, but that doesn't mean it doesn't sing.|Fresh
Offerman has a sly way of commanding the screen, avoiding any of the ingratiating gestures that would have turned Frank into an off-beat role model.|Fresh
This is the film that makes Kiersey Clemons a star. A uniquely musical, big-hearted gem about a father-daughter bond. Nick Offerman is also terrific. A perfect antidote to superhero movies.|Fresh
Smug nonsense that is far more grating than edifying and which hard sells its simple-minded sentiments in as hollow and forced of a manner equal to that of any big studio behemoth.|Rotten
Its warmth and excellent music makes it a step above the usual indie Sundance comedies, with a tremendous heart that shadows the film's missteps.|Fresh
A lowkey, tenderhearted film that explores a mostly functional and loving relationship between a somewhat immature dad and his somewhat too mature daughter.|Fresh
Maybe a little too brooding for its own good, and its character-driven nature may leave audiences wondering just what conflict is driving the story at times, but it finishes with a nice third act.|Rotten
A good-natured, inoffensive little movie, though it's as instantly forgettable as the generic tunes its father and daughter compose together... At least they aren't named Partridge.|Rotten
[E]stablishes its central relationship ... subtly ... naturally, and ... thoroughly.|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud's pleasures are many and varied.|Fresh
Hearts is of a piece with other movies by writer-director Brett Haley, wherein the art has the power to ameliorate rather than transform.|Fresh
A dramatically feathery but irresistibly likable dramedy.|Fresh
Haley's films are things we can reach toward-there's an intimacy and candor about them that feels welcoming.|Fresh
A sparkling gem with an indie-rock soul. Offerman turns in his best big-screen performance yet.|Fresh
You've heard this song before and can predict all the emotional high notes before they hit, but sometimes that's all you need from a summer bop.|Fresh
"One of the nicest things about ""Hearts Beat Loud,"" and there are several nice things, is the way that Offerman and Clemons seem like father and daughter."|Fresh
The themes here are rich, the treatment indulgent and harmless, like a pre-fab version of a John Carney movie.|Fresh
Haley keeps the effort on track, trying to extract as much emotional texture as possible, giving the endeavor a lived-in sense of time, love, and harmony.|Fresh
A lyrical tale of dealing with passions. It warmly deals with how there are times to fight for what you love and times to let go.|Fresh
I could not wrap myself around any of the many stories. As soon as I started to garner sympathy for one family plight, the film shifts to another. In the end, I was left feeling uninvolved.|Fresh
But the real star of this thing is [Kiersey] Clemons, so natural and expressive, whether speaking or singing.|Fresh
A happy, sunshiny movie.... Come for the exemplary father-daughter relationship, stay for the soundtrack.|Fresh
"Its smallness is its strength - as is its silence. That's the odd and evocative resonance of ""Hearts Beat Loud."""|Fresh
Audiences will be enchanted by Clemons and Offerman's astounding chemistry.|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud is a charming indie rock musical that succeeds on the strength of characterization and the performances from Nick Offerman and Kiersey Clemons, the latter of which is one very talented singer and actress|Fresh
It often seems as though Haley, aware of the goldmine he struck with these two, is prepared to get out of the way and let them tell the story.|Fresh
Haley's look at the lighter, and lightly darker, side of family life between a father and his daughter is a super(b) counterpoint to this summer's blockbusters.|Fresh
Like Lady Bird, this is a touching intergenerational flick with dark-horse Oscar potential.|Fresh
If you want nice and charming, that's what this is.|Fresh
As written, I didn't believe these characters. And if Nick Offerman and Kiersey Clemons and Ted Danson...cannot convince me that these are actual human beings, then no one can.|Rotten
"The flat intonation and lethargic matter-of-factness that made Offerman's Ron Swanson the wry backbone of ""Parks & Recreation"" feels too heavy for Frank Fisher."|Rotten
... an incisive and heartfelt look at lingering grief, family dynamics, and the occasional need to hit life's reset button. Both lead performances are terrific.|Fresh
Coming-of-age dramedy finds family harmony amidst upheaval.|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud is like a mini playlist of comfort tracks. It eases the mind and gives you a reason to smile.|Fresh
It's refreshing to watch a film that doesn't feel obligated to go for the brass ring (of emotion, or social commentary, or even plot).|Fresh
A bit on-the-nose and not at all challenging, but delightfully bittersweet. And the music's not bad either.|Fresh
Haley writes roles that great actors want to play, and he creates a space for them to do their best.|Fresh
"Frank and Sam make beautiful music together. No, that's not a metaphor; it's an accurate description that's central to what makes ""Hearts Beat Loud"" such an engaging endeavor."|Fresh
Music is the tie that binds a Brooklyn father and daughter in a film that refuses to go sappy on us thanks to the tough core of intelligence and wit that Nick Offerman brings to the party.|Fresh
There's not a rough edge in sight - and, for many viewers, that will be just fine.|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud is good cotton candy, but bereft of stakes it's all fluff and empty calories.|Fresh
In the midst of this already overheated summer movie season, it feels like a cool drink of water.|Fresh
There's no way this doesn't end up being the #1 feel-good movie of the summer.|Fresh
These hearts are beating, just a tad too loud. Brett Haley's loving drama is full of heart, but so determinedly, you can't help but feel a bit exhausted by it all.|Fresh
Brass tax, Nick Offerman and Kiersey Clemons shape Hearts Beat Loud into their own layered underground hit that marches to a unified tempo.|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud is smart, sincere, expertly performed...|Fresh
I couldn't help, in spite of the sometimes very clunky script, breaking into a smile every time Sam and Rose have a scene together, even a corny bike-riding one.|Fresh
The film is a wonderful showcase for the multi-talented Clemons, who gives Keegan DeWitt's original songs conviction and soul.|Fresh
The steadiness with which Haley's film progresses through its dramatic beats is rather like its familiar-sounding indie pop, moving rhythmically toward a predictable climax whose emotional intensity feels unearned.|Rotten
Hearts Beat Loud steals your heart, makes it beat faster and you'll love this story out loud.|Fresh
Both actors are capable of projecting nuclear levels of charisma, so it's fun just to watch them share the screen.|Fresh
An existential hangout picture, complete with a pretty catchy pop soundtrack.|Fresh
The real charm isn't in the way the story unfolds, but in the human moments shared onscreen. Offerman and Clemons feel at first like an unlikely pair, but their chemistry is genuine.|Fresh
The two leads have a pleasant chemistry that elevates each exchange and build out a meaningful-and meaningfully deep-relationship that's easy to engage with and root for.|Fresh
"The messiness of the script or the lack of an aesthetic approach just don't seem to matter all that much. ""Hearts Beats Loud"" knows exactly what it is."|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud is a charming and heartwarming film that I loved every moment of.|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud will put a spring in your step. The music is great, the story is heartwarming, plus Offerman and Clemons make a great father/daughter duo.|Fresh
A hip, pleasant indie comedy with lovely performances from Offerman and Clemons.|Fresh
In a rare leading man role, Offerman exudes charm and charisma in a performance that shatters his Ron Swanson image (said as a devout Parks and Recreation fan).|Fresh
With her immense talent, this could be the star making role of Clemons' career.|Fresh
A truly sweet, funny, and downright likable comedy.|Fresh
Kiersey Clemons proves she's the real deal. As for the film around her, Haley's 21-drum solo salute to the passage of time is, like Frank, merely fine.|Fresh
A sincere, occasionally touching family dramedy with a music backdrop.|Fresh
Hearts Beat Loud is a musical masterpiece.|Fresh
