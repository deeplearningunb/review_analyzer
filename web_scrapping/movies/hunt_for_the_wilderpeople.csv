This warmed my heart plenty on the cold night that I watched it, and that's exactly what I needed.|Fresh
Hector and Ricky build an uneasy and finally heartwarming camaraderie.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople transforms a fairly unremarkable tale of adoption into a wild and wonderful fantasy, yet again proving that New Zealand may as well just be Middle Earth.|Fresh
It's just so sophisticated and mordantly humorous you don't notice at first that it's also in the tradition of a classic boy's adventure tale.|Fresh
a leisurely and hopeful coming-of-age comedy adapted from Barry Crump's 1986 novel, Wild Pork and Watercress.|Fresh
It all sounds very serious, but it's not at all, with director Taika Waititi injecting a rich vein of dark humour and a cast of eccentric characters to deliver something that is weird, funny and mildly moving.|Fresh

It's funny, sweet, sad, and exhilarating all at once.|Fresh
Wilderpeople is a hugely loveable movie that's suitable for date night or the whole family, and I know that sounds like a hacky movie poster blurb. But when a movie's this good, it's tough to avoid clichs.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople tackles some fairly serious issues, but it handles those issues with just the right sense of the sweet.|Fresh
It has all the makings of a new childhood classic: it's got wonder and adventure and loads of humor, and ultimately winds up on the side of optimism - but it also has moments of genuine tragedy and danger.|Fresh
A film about romanticism, respect, acceptance and loyalty, however, it becomes excellent because of the construction of one of the most wonderful characters that modern cinema has given us. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Its whackiness and borderline fantasy might not be for everyone, but there's a universal, childlike appeal to the story that feels too powerful to deny.|Fresh
I can't remember the last time I laughed this much at a movie. This wacky adventure set in New Zealand's wilderness is outrageously funny. It is filled with quirky, compelling characters and witty dialog.|Fresh
Wilderpeople emerges as a hugely likeable but not always coherent yarn.|Fresh
While there are numerous nods to cultural references only a local audience will appreciate, Ricky and Hec's emotional journey is one which every viewer can climb aboard.|Fresh
In Hunt for the Wilderpeople by Taika Waititi, lush landscapes of the rainforest of New Zealand counter a sense of humor so toast-dry that it makes the British Ealing comedies of the 1950s seem overripe.|Fresh
The film would be thuddingly familiar if not for Waititi's willingness to grasp overused tropes and manipulate them into something new.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is one of the most entertaining films of the year.|Fresh
Warmly funny and deeply delightful.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is very likely the summer's most magical film.|Fresh
This is really a wonderful adventure-comedy.|Fresh
Sweeping cinematography (by Lachlan Milne) and playful editing (by Luke Haigh, Tom Eagles and Yana Gorskaya) make the adventure all the more majestical.|Fresh
Strictly for those who love pie-eyed problem pics with scenic wanderlust.|Rotten
What keeps all this enchantment grounded is the characters.|Fresh
It's formulaic at heart, but has a sweet, unpredictable sense of humour and a nice way with words.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople might just be Waititi's most triumphant moment to date.|Fresh
A splendidly morbid comedy for the whole family.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a kicky treat.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is unabashedly sentimental, and some of the specific tragic notes threaten to come across as cloying, but the comedy gives it a lot of life.|Fresh
Waititi shows a larger scope than his previous films, with overhead shots surveying the gorgeous New Zealand landscape. A snowy montage scene set to Leonard Cohen recalls Robert Altman's 1971 opus McCabe and Mrs. Miller.|Fresh
In the hands director Taika Waititi, who mixes sentimentality with spiky, even absurdist humor, it's a remarkable treat.|Fresh
[The film] has a laidback, gentle tone - one that makes the viewer lean in to listen carefully.|Fresh
...looks as funny as it sounds.|Fresh
... a coming of age comedy with a heartwarming soul that never slips into easy sentiment.|Fresh
This film is an adventure itself, a gem that surely will become brighter over time. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A mixture of comedy, drama, whimsy and anarchy (and with plenty of charm to spare, even if sometimes the tone wavers a little), this is almost impossible not to like, and it's the strong characters that draw you in.|Fresh
There's brilliant chemistry between Dennison and Neil, the pair quite obviously bouncing off each other; a joy to watch on screen, and as the story progresses you begin to feel like a member of their special pack, gleefully part of the adventure.|Fresh
The film's main asset is an unaffected naturalism, both in the film-making, and in the unpolished characters that we root for.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople has been a huge audience favourite at festivals this year and you can see why, with its brand of dark New Zealand humour, coupled with a boy's own adventure story that goes not merely off the rails, but off-road and off-grid.|Fresh
It's hard to imagine anybody not being won over by this charming adventure, which I'm already looking forward to watching again.|Fresh
This charming comedy combines endearing characters with generous helpings of deadpan humour - and the result is quite wonderful.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a fun, funny family yarn.|Fresh
A sweet crowdpleaser guaranteed to lift your spirits.|Fresh
It's far from original - grumpy-old-git-bond-with-mouthy-adolescent - but is delivered with such joy-infused enthusiasm it's almost impossible to resist.|Fresh
It's a not unpromising set-up -- masculinity left to fend for itself against Mother Nature -- and I wished Waititi had made merry with his hapless hunter-gatherers in the same way Shadows did with wannabe outlaw vampires.|Rotten
Waititi keeps the jokes coming thick and fast, delivering hi-jinks and heightened characters with an emotional undertow that really resonates.|Fresh
Without actively disliking any part of it, you wish you could be on your way a whole hour before it limps to a close.|Rotten
An inward-looking comedy that's not afraid to poke fun at its country's own foibles but still manages to feel like a celebration of life on a little island.|Fresh
Growing up, growing old and the grief that's part of both is beautifully handled here with a quirky mix of humour and heart.|Fresh
Warm, witty, and occasionally wild, Waititi's bush-bonding romp is a kind, generous-spirited winner.|Fresh
Delightful... Ends up being sweet and affecting despite its characters' disdain for mushy stuff.|Fresh
A bit Up, a bit Moonrise Kingdom, a bit Midnight Run, even... Taika Waititi's latest is an oddball treat of a mismatched-buddy pursuit move.|Fresh
While I could go on and on about what good company Neill and Dennison are, it's an actress named Rima Te Wiata who works the most magic.|Fresh
Bring a hanky.|Fresh
It's a classic reluctant camaraderie story with emotion that sways like trees in a gentle breeze between sad, bittersweet, and rambunctious adventure.|Fresh
Neill could play a cranky old bushman in his sleep, but it's Julian Dennison as Ricky who steals the film as a rap-loving, pre-pubescent gangster wannabe. This kid's a find.|Fresh
... uses familiar themes to launch a exploration of misfit male bonding and surrogate families with heartfelt tenderness and visual flair.|Fresh
This charming, witty and heartfelt film about the meaning of family might just remind you that there really are fresh voices at the movies.|Fresh
The byplay between the newcomer Dennison and the veteran Neill is delightful, as the two characters' faades slowly melt and a genuine bond of affection develops.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a refreshing alternative to standard Hollywood children's fare.|Fresh
"""Wilderpeople"" isn't Taititi's best work, but it's impressively executed, making time for broad antics and intimate exchanges without unraveling into a mess of ideas."|Fresh
"Waititi's most iconically ""New Zealand"" movie shows a deep love of the country's ""majestical"" landscapes and the rough-and-tumble people that live in its hidden places."|Fresh
It has too many strained feel-good moments for my comfort zone.|Rotten
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is excellent when it focuses solely on the relationship between -- and the misadventures of -- its two central figures. It's less captivating when the attention turns to several doltish supporting characters.|Fresh
Yet another home run from Taika Waititi...|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople treads on such familiar ground that it's a miracle it works as well as it does.|Fresh
Waititi's film has the stylized exaggerations and emotional directness of the best children's literature. Everything is just a tiny bit louder and more colorful than real life, but the feelings are straightforward and unadorned.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople shows us a cruel, unsentimental and thankless world, and yet we're made to love that world anyway.|Fresh
This is a movie you watch with minor pleasure when you happen upon it channel surfing on cable TV. Leaving home for it and selecting it over and above a city's full cinematic outlay is another matter.|Rotten
Flawed 'Wilderpeople' has its requisite charms.|Fresh
When this film earns your tears... and it will... it does it honestly, and I suspect this is a film that people are going to share by word of mouth for years, one of those rare gems that will play equally well for viewers of any age.|Fresh
Great screen chemistry and shimmering cinematography make this film work.|Fresh
Few films have ever been less likely to get but more deserving of a sequel.|Fresh
Its heartwarming message combined with creative, fantastical elements make it unique and memorable.|Fresh
"The story, told in Wes Anderson-style storybook chapters with titles like ""Goodbye Ricky Baker"" and ""Close to the Sky,"" grows ever more absurd, almost to the breaking point."|Fresh
"""Wilderpeople"" is one of those rare movies that works for almost any generation, silly and sweet and big-hearted. To quote Hec, it's a majestical piece of filmmaking."|Fresh
A 60 year-old man and a 12-year old boy's walk on the wild side in New Zealand.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a thoughtful and hilarious film with nuanced performances from the two leads.|Fresh
A charming coming-of-age film set in the New Zealand bush, complete with a company of quirky, mismatched characters.|Fresh
A warm-hearted, funny, well-crafted coming-of-age story.|Fresh
... Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a wonderfully executed genre cocktail where one moment will leave you breathless from laughter, the next recovering from heartache.|Fresh
Has more genuinely funny moments than most so-called comedies at the multiplex, abetted by Waititi's now-practiced comic sensibility, his stylized snap of performance and editing.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is all about life-changing moments and the people who are the catalysts. It's about learning from those around you, regardless of age or circumstance.|Fresh
It takes a well-worn premise and turns it into a quirkily funny delight.|Fresh
HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE, the most endearing buddy comedy adventure you'll see this year. It has all the wit and its crafty humor will keep you laughing and entertained from beginning to end. See this movie as soon as you can.|Fresh
There is so much goodness, such an unabashed sense of decency, in the first act of Hunt for the Wilderpeople that the sentiment carries through the rest of the film...|Fresh
"It's a beautiful and moving ""buddy"" story --- full of hilarity."|Fresh
"Without the exceptional performances from Sam Neill and Julian Dennison, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" would likely devolve into an outlandish situation comedy-wannabe."|Fresh
Given Waititi's creativity, I was a little disappointed in how few surprises there are in Wilderpeople. But it's all right to be just a well-executed charmer -- and this movie is certainly that.|Fresh
Quirky Kiwi dramedy promotes teamwork, friendship.|Fresh
A lopsided gem full of off-kilter humor, hard truths and real emotion. Great for preteens and up.|Fresh
Waititi looks for humor in quirks of character and degrees of stubbornness, and the natural challenges of Crump's wilderness journey generate a succession of belly laughs onscreen as the gruff old man scraps with the loudmouthed kid.|Fresh
"Laugh-out-loud funny one minute, achingly sad the next, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" takes the audience on a rollicking yet poignant journey through the New Zealand backcountry in the company of a pair of engagingly eccentric characters."|Fresh
A kind and moving story bristling with honest humor and genuine affection for its characters.|Fresh
Dennison is a marvel, completely unself-conscious in his portrayal of a kid who is lost but thinks if he acts tough, it'll look like he's found. Neill, playing a different sort of character for him (quiet, unfriendly), is also outstanding.|Fresh
The movie's intense charm, killer performances, and offbeat music -- from Nina Simone to '70s soft rock -- make it a must-see for 2016.|Fresh
"""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" has much to recommend it, but none of it would work unless Hec and Ricky are believable and have chemistry. Fortunately, they do."|Fresh
The cranky charisma of the performers, plus the cheerfully idiosyncratic rhythms of Waititi's filmmaking, keep it clicking.|Fresh
As funny as it is scary. But it's also utterly charming, and surprisingly moving in ways you'd never expect.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople manages to be touching without turning sappy, and funny without relying on cheap humor.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople magically taps into the logic, thought processes, and emotions of a child. It's a rich, strange, and wondrous world.|Fresh
Hunt For the Wilderpeople is funny, moving, enthralling and exciting, and impossible to not be drawn into.|Fresh
May sound like a National Geographic special but is actually a genuine, offbeat road trip comedy/coming-of-age film.|Fresh
A New Zealand import with a knack for finding humor in dreary, even ill-advised themes.|Fresh
Waititi is an expansive, warm-hearted humanist. The fun he pokes is strictly superficial, never grazing his characters' vital organs or essential dignity.|Fresh
One of the year's most transportive comedies.|Fresh
Like What We Do In The Shadows, Wilderpeople is laugh-out-loud funny and full of left-turn surprises.|Fresh
Full of off-kilter characters, an improbable set of events, and a touching if predictable ending, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is as enjoyable to watch as it is a gorgeously shot film.|Fresh
Neill and Dennison's chemistry ensures this unusual survival story is so knee-deep in charm that even moments of gloopy pathos feel thoroughly earned.|Fresh
An oddball and oddly affecting take on two misfits finding their metaphorical partner-in-crime match.|Fresh
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is ultimately disarming in its innocent sincerity.|Fresh
"a hilarious and heartfelt adventure that's a Kiwi twist on the curmudgeonly Carl and overweight outsider Russell of Pixar's ""Up"" by way of the outlaws that were ""Thelma and Louise."""|Fresh
New Zealand writer-director Taika Waititi blends sharply cynical humour with huge heart in arguably his best film to date, Hunt for the Wilderpeople.|Fresh

Wilderpeople is fully redeemed by its sense of humor, both deadpan and broad, well-delivered through the strong performances.|Fresh
101 minutes of pure comic joy.|Fresh
Waititi's films have a lively energy that provides a delicious counterpoint to the understated comedy.|Fresh
Wilderpeople is ultimately winning, like all buddy comedies, because of the chemistry of its leads.|Fresh
"""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" takes a troika of familiar story types - the plucky kid, the crusty geezer, the nurturing bosom - and strips them of clich."|Fresh
Ricky is a wonderfully fresh creation, the embodiment of hilarity because he doesn't see anything funny about anything, least of all himself.|Fresh
A familiar sort of coming-of-age movie made more interesting by the uniqueness of its setting and its off-kilter Kiwi humor.|Fresh
"Every once in a while, a small, unheralded film comes along, so smart and funny, such a pleasure to experience, you can't believe your luck. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is such a film."|Fresh
We know we're in good hands from the opening moments, when the New Zealand greenery undulates across the screen while an otherworldly choral chant fills the soundtrack.|Fresh
Enjoy this wonderfully unpredictable, eccentric tale.|Fresh
It's off-beat in all the best ways, has fantastic actors all delivering fantastic performances, and is a uproarious adventure with endless heart.|Fresh
Dennison juggles foulmouthed brattiness and sweet sincerity well enough, and Neill soars as a gruff outdoorsman hiding a soft, chewy center.|Fresh
A delightful little movie that ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of the year thus far.|Fresh
"An enjoyably goofy adventure that manages to bring some freshness to the moldy ""cantankerous adult reluctantly bonds with adorable kid"" subgenre."|Fresh
[A] lovely little study of bonding and healing in the New Zealand bush.|Fresh
In the midst of another big blockbuster summer, this raffish comedy-adventure provides a breath of fresh air.|Fresh
It infuses an outdoorsy survival tale and a coming-of-age story of friendship with Taika Waititi's penchant for distaff flakiness.|Fresh
A wonderful slice of New Zealand-bred humor that should have a far wider appeal than Waititi's previous films.|Fresh
A rollicking, joke-filled, brightly-colored boys' adventure where both boy and adult get to be boys.|Fresh
As a transient feel-good movie it certainly is 'magestical'.|Fresh
Quirky outsider comedy is clearly Waititi's forte, and here it's polished to an effortlessly funny, confident and crowd-pleasing shine.|Fresh
A deliciously good time at the movies.|Fresh
This is Waititi's best film yet. The way he mixes tones throughout the film is a thing of beauty.|Fresh
With its youthful protagonist, wicked sense of humor, and monstrous depiction of authority figures, the spirit of Roald Dahl is alive and well in Hunt for the Wilderpeople.|Fresh
Offbeat, intimate and impressively affecting, this Kiwi comedy is one of the year's strongest films to date.|Fresh
This may sound like a standard adventure narrative or buddy film, but Waititi magnificently feels out the nuances with enormous heart.|Fresh
It's quite possibly the best movie (so far) this year.|Fresh
New Zealand has never looked more breath-taking (and fearsome) and the performances are all tremendous here.|Fresh
Dennison holds his own opposite Neill, who hasn't been tasked with such a gravely amusing role in years. Together, the two are comic dynamite.|Fresh
It's like being killed with kindness, a good problem to have but a hard one to define beyond pleasantries|Fresh
Waititi, who wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Barry Crump, is pretty fearless in his tonal palette ... It's not your conventional, conservative kid's flick, to its definite credit.|Fresh
Sam Neill is as good as he's ever been, spurred on by his unpredictable and lively offsider, Julian Dennison. It's a good sign when you don't want a movie to end.|Fresh
[An] immensely likable film.|Fresh
This film is a rough-cut, homegrown gem.|Fresh
This deceptively quaint feel-good comedy-adventure instantly finds an arresting storytelling groove that cannot help but win you over. It is, without doubt, one of the best films that will be released in 2016.|Fresh
If you're after a film that's funny and sweet and harks back to a certain kind of innocent (but not toothless) 80s action-adventure, then Hunt for the Wilderpeople is perfect.|Fresh
...a very winning comedy.|Fresh
In an age of branded films, it's such a relief to stumble upon a film like Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Filmmaking this fresh, this vibrant, and this affecting for all ages is rare these days.|Fresh
The humour here is derived from the gap between a fantastic scenario and the everyday outcomes. It's [Waititi's] ability to create a self-contained world - complete with amateurish songs - which makes the resulting dialogue so amusing.|Fresh
I do find New Zealand films refreshingly offbeat, crazy in the most entertaining way, and peopled with characters who inhabit the outer edges of society. In this film, those characteristics are in abundance|Fresh
It's a small film with a big heart and one whose charm resonates and grows on you|Fresh
The Revenant had a lot of things (too many things, even), but it didn't have the heart, humour and hoodies of Taika Waititi's Hunt for the Wilderpeople... one of 2016's best, warmest and wildest comedies.|Fresh
"Wilderpeople is the best film of 2016, so far; or as Ricky and Uncle Hect would say - ""sh*t just got real."""|Fresh
Here is the perfect example of a film that at a glance appears to be going one way, but winds up somewhere far more entertaining and endearing that you could possibly expect.|Fresh
It's a gentle movie, but with a bittersweet edge - and it's funny as hell to boot.|Fresh
Full of character and comedy, it's easily one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Hunt For The Wilderpeople is a comical, soul-searching tale from the Bush that delights around every leaf-covered turn.|Fresh
It finds humor and love in a potentially grim situation without ever belittling or caricaturing the characters.|Fresh
Neil proves compellingly gruff as a reluctant father figure, though it's the trash-talking, family-craving ten-year-old Dennison who steals the show, exuding a wacko, wounded attitude rooted in Ricky's backwoods Rambo-Scarface-Mad Max reveries.|Fresh
The remarkable performance of young Julian Dennison as Ricky Baker, the city juvenile delinquent fostered out in the backblocks, gives Wilderpeople most of its many laughs. But he's not just there doing cute stuff and being precocious.|Fresh
A hilarious, heartwarming tale that harnesses script, direction and performances and takes plenty of creative risks on its way to delivering movie magic.|Fresh
A throwback family classic in the mold of The Goonies.|Fresh
While the plot and some of the characters may be a bit cartoonish, the emotions always feel honest and Waititi is able to get some big laughs thanks to his charming protagonists.|Fresh
If one imagines a real-life version of Up with a bit of Thelma & Louise thrown in, they get [this] charming on-the-run adventure comedy.|Fresh
There's no point where Hunt for the Wilderpeople does anything that you've never seen before, but it would be crazy to hold that against a film made with such an effortlessly cultivated tone and an accommodating ear for comedy.|Fresh
Taika Waititi knows growing up isn't child's play but he also respects childhood as a place of adventure, where spontaneity rules and the possibilities are only limited by imagination.|Fresh
Built on formula, but when a formula is this well-executed, it's awfully hard to complain.|Fresh
"""Hunt For The Wilderpeople"" is a perfectly amicable dramedy that makes a concerted effort to avoid offending or provoking."|Fresh
Waititi manages the balance of tones perfectly and his eye for editing and action show both scale and restraint, so he won't fall short and won't go overboard.|Fresh
There aren't a lot of truly fantastic kids movies out there nowadays, but this is one of them.|Fresh
A sweetly-told, laugh-out-loud adventure that reminds us you're never too young or too old to find someone to love who'll also love you back.|Fresh
