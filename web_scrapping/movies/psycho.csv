Psycho is not a long film but it feels long. Perhaps because the director dawdles over technical effects; perhaps because it is difficult, if not impossible, to care about any of the characters.|Rotten
The shower sequence, the shrieking score, Anthony Perkins, that twist ending... Psycho remains a stone-cold classic.|Fresh
It's not hardly Hitchcock at his most flawless, but not a single film he ever made... is so absolutely flattening as a total experience.|Fresh
Watching Psycho today we are all, like Marion in the shower, vainly trying to recover lost innocence too late.|Fresh
It is incumbent on us to inspect the real horrors of our time, but we don't have to traffic with Hitchcock's giggling obscenities.|Rotten

Still crazy -- and still crazy-good -- after all these years.|Fresh
Masterful suspense and horror from one of the greats.|Fresh
It's a darkly amusing, manipulative film that's still compelling in its vision of human desperation.|Fresh
Always worth another look, especially on the big screen.|Fresh
Look into Janet Leigh's eye after the shower scene and be amazed how fresh this black-and-white ghoulish chic seems in the saccharine surroundings of modern cinema.|Fresh
"Alfred Hitchcock should be credited with making the first slasher film for the ground-breaking narrative template he created for ""Psycho."""|Fresh
I'd wager there aren't any films that have been more analyzed than Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.|Fresh
Director Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one, and the delicate illusion of reality necessary for a creak-and-shriek movie becomes, instead, a spectacle of stomach-churning horror.|Rotten
An unusual, good entertainment, indelibly Hitchcock, and on the right kind of boxoffice beam.|Fresh
...one of the great achievements in the horror genre.|Fresh
Time may have dulled the shock, but the craft is as impressive as ever.|Fresh
Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece blends a brutal manipulation of audience identification and an incredibly dense, allusive visual style to create the most morally unsettling film ever made.|Fresh
The music, the setting, the shower scene, the mother in the cellar... everything about this iconic film has passed into cinema history.|Fresh
You can bet that everyone who's ever seen it immediately feels their heart start to pound when they're in the shower and hear someone enter the bathroom.|Fresh
Hitchcock classic|Fresh
Janet Leigh, stalking around in pointy brassieres, making bird-gestures, and flirting with the coprophobic Perkins, is one of cinema's most deliciously perverse pleasures.|Fresh

Classic Hitchcock built on two key scenes and one brilliant performance.|Fresh
With his toothpick build and childish voice, Bates appears to be little more than a shy coward, making the revelation of his psychotic nature shocking.|Fresh
A classic. You kinda wish the final reveal were a bit more subtle, but it always works.|Fresh
It's marvelous. Pioneered so many bits of the genre that it's lost without the proper context.|Fresh

...more than the great granddaddy of all slasher films; it is a great thriller, a great black comedy, and a lesson in filmmaking.|Fresh
I understand that the gods of film will rain fire down upon my head when I say this, but I didn't think Psycho was as good as it was supposed to be.|Fresh
|Fresh
Gripping and irrevocably gruesome fare played to perfection by a top notch cast.|Fresh
[Hitchcock's] denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair.|Fresh
A rare must-see.|Fresh
As a horror film, it is a horrifying study in terror, and as film in general, it is a brilliant study in style and mood, as well as the darkest regions of a person's psyche.|Fresh
This is the Hitchcock that sticks it to its audience in the most gleefully malicious ways.|Fresh
A textbook example of audience manipulation, as Hitchcock shifts our identification from character to character with the alacrity of a magician.|Fresh
[Hitchcock] has very shrewdly interwoven crime, sex and suspense, blended the real and the unreal in fascinating proportions and punctuated his film with several quick, grisly and unnerving surprises.|Fresh
Whereas in most movies nowadays one can usually predict what will happen next, Psycho transcends the tired horror genre completely.|Fresh
All those who still get a chill every time they step into a hotel shower, say aye. That, you see, is the power of Psycho.|Fresh

Psycho might be not perfect, but it is still watched and maintains its reputation, despite the fact that even those who watch it for the first time know everything about it. This strange fact is the ultimate viewing recommendation.|Fresh
Hitchcock introduced the American Nightmare strain into the genre. He also revived the fast-fading art of montage with the now legendary shower sequence.|Fresh
With the exception of Halloween, no latter-day horror/thriller has been capable of generating as many goosebumps.|Fresh
A perfect Saturday matinee.|Fresh
What makes Psycho immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theater, is that it connects directly with our fears.|Fresh
