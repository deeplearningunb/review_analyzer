It's great we are getting to a place where queer characters no longer have to be tragic or outcasts. However, let's still make them interesting.|Rotten
At its core, God's Own Country is all about our right to tenderness, and with the Yorkshire pastures as a constant backdrop, tenderness flows out from every stitch in the film's fabric.|Fresh

To see O'Connor and Secareanu breathe life into these guarded men who choose to drop their defenses, and bring out each other's best selves in the process, is to watch a barren field grow lush and green.|Fresh
...frank and sexy and ultimately bravely optimistic.|Fresh
"Gritty unsentimental rural British riff on ""Brokeback Mountain"""|Fresh
The movie is less about sexual awakening than Gheorghe's civilizing influence on Johnny. But it's also sometimes hot and violent, in a good way.|Fresh

The result is a remarkable debut from a director who clearly excels in close studies of human fragility.|Fresh

Because the movie is less about can they stay together and more about the personal growth from deadbeat to responsibility on the part of the son by letting love in, God's Own Country works magnificently|Fresh
This debut feature from Yorkshire-born actor and first-time director Francis Lee shows the British countryside as a lonely and unforgiving place; his camera unflinching as it captures the graphic realities of livestock farming.|Fresh
This is just a strikingly well-observed story about two lost people who find each other in an unexpected place.|Fresh
Set in a bleakly beautiful Yorkshire farmscape (hence the title), God's Own Country isn't particularly fixed on one calendar or another, but it's definitely a statement of today.|Fresh
I enjoyed God's Own Country for its realistic style and its unflinching vision of intimacy.|Fresh
[It's] not going to facilitate streams of empathy toward its protagonists, but little by little, with extreme delicacy, it becomes clear that there are emotions and vulnerabilities that the body understands before the mind. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Some really exceptional moments. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Not only personal and intimate, but also largely creative. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
God's Own Country becomes memorable for its unrelenting naturalism and for its refusal to see hearts and flowers where only mud, animals, walled-off human emotions and rare moments of tenderness are able to survive. But survive they do.|Fresh
... worth noting that it leaves aside the issue (tired, but current, and even more so in rural areas) of coming out of the closet, focusing instead on issues such as xenophobia, fidelity and personal honesty. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Just about the time you're ready to secede from this dank, muddy pity party, HE walks in. And by ""he"" I mean Alec Secareanu's Romanian hunk, Gheorghe. You can't quit him."|Fresh
The look of the film fits the rugged locale of Yorkshire, England and shows the tough life of the locals.|Fresh
The movie must be commended for attempting a lead character that is not entirely likable; it's only through Gheorghe that we discover something worthwhile in the sad, suffering Johnny.|Fresh
God's Own Country, in its silence, empathy for characters and admiration for nature, is engulfing.|Fresh
A raw, tender, and at times deeply sensual autobiographical feature debut from writer-director Francis Lee.|Fresh

God's Own Country is a love letter to the land, but also to an unconventional romance, struggling against intolerance.|Fresh
A gay love story that reveals the beauty of a landscape and acts of mercy.|Fresh
Joshua James Richards's camera also regards human coupling and animal husbandry with the same blunt honesty: it's beautiful, but it's awfully messy. You could say the same thing about love.|Fresh
Actor-turned-director Francis Lee's indie hit conjures rough beauty from a rural Yorkshire setting, careful cinematography, and splendid naturalistic acting.|Fresh
You never doubt that this tough life is being portrayed from the inside.|Fresh
In his debut feature, Lee has crafted a mature love story centered on an immature man facing the fear of even admitting that he needs love at all. It's a film to prize.|Fresh
God's Own Country is one of most surprising, touching, and finest of the year.|Fresh
A former actor himself, Lee directs his leads with subtle assurance.|Fresh
"Toughness and tenderness duke it out to the bittersweet end of ""God's Own Country,"" a transporting, wrenchingly acted love story set in the windswept wilds of northern England."|Fresh
Gorgeously shot without romanticizing rural England, it's no Brokeback Mountain but strives to get close to that.|Fresh
God's Own Country builds upon a lingering sense of earned romance, rather than an attraction based on convenience, which is sadly too often the case with queer cinema.|Fresh
Dour in the extreme but also pretty damn sexy, this rural gay romance will certainly have its specialized audience appeal, without the big crossover of the great Moonlight.|Fresh
A tricky movie, but not in a way that's dishonest.|Fresh
"""God's Own Country"" weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards's biting cinematography and the story's slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful."|Fresh
Writer-director Francis Lee captures not only what masculinity does and how it comes undone, but the complex apparatus that keeps it into place: the family's surveillance, the silence, the shame.|Fresh

God's Own Country is a very old fashioned love story brought kicking into the 21st century by director/writer Francis Lee's boldness and sheer honesty.|Fresh
Sexuality is not a means of escape, but a way of making sense of these demanding lives for both the characters and the audience. The dialogue is sparse but illuminating, while the storytelling leaves you powerfully involved.|Fresh

The relationship between the two men isn't the only romance in the film, as the camera slowly falls in love with rural Yorkshire.|Fresh
Lee has a lovely eye for symbolic detail - a single light in the farmhouse window glowing through a dawn the colour of slurry emphasises just how alone Johnny is.|Fresh
Some have celebrated this one as a queer masterpiece, which it isn't quite. Yet it's nevertheless still strongly handled, boldly played by all, and pretty damn sensual.|Fresh

A wonderful portrait of life in a harsh, lonely place, and of romance as a prompt for personal growth and changing traditions. Raises the bar for British indies.|Fresh
Some will file God's Own Country under F for fantasy. Others will see it as a portent of rapprochements to come. Either way, it's a winner.|Fresh
You'll find yourself getting teary a week later - a potent, haunting meditation on the soul-stirring significance of being open to love.|Fresh
An outstanding debut feature.|Fresh
Francis Lee's splendid directorial debut has been billed as a Yorkshire Brokeback Mountain and there are undeniable parallels... God's Own Country, however, is significantly less glamorous than its Oscar-nominated predecessor.|Fresh
In truth this movie is definitely a sum of all its parts - a glorious film about responsibility, love and future.|Fresh
An exemplary character study, with bold, fully realised performances from O'Connor and Secareanu and typically excellent support from Ian Hart and Gemma Jones.|Fresh

A deeply affecting, emotionally resonant coming-out story about self-acceptance and the transformative power of love.|Fresh
God's Own Country is hard to fault on its own terms and earns the assumption that lies behind any worthwhile movie romance, that love can take root even in the most unlikely soil.|Fresh
This is a highly impressive debut feature: bleak and lyrical by turns, and with very fine performances from its two young leads.|Fresh
It unfolds under grey, blustery spring skies; as lambs emerge blinking and unsteady into the world, so too does this young man's nervous, raw sexuality.|Fresh

God's Own Country is a swoon-worthy romance.|Fresh

God's Own Country is an impressive debut that cleverly subverts clich.|Fresh
God's Own Country is a contender for the best film I've seen this year.|Fresh
The film has a cumulative power that sneaks up on you even as you think you're keeping track of it, and a twilit afterglow that hasn't faded yet.|Fresh
A tender love story that's deeply cinematic and builds to a heart-swelling conclusion free of sentimentality.|Fresh
Fluid photography and achingly honest performances merge magnificently, with the story of love amidst the livestock considerably more charming than it sounds.|Fresh
Joshua James Richards is, after Songs My Brothers Taught Me and this, a cinematographer to watch, who grasps the wildness of open spaces with a poetic lens.|Fresh
A striking debut that should mark the beginning on an immensely triumphant career behind the camera for Lee. Visually, narratively, emotionally - this film succeeds on every level, and does so in such an uncompromising way.|Fresh
A raw and affecting love story teeming with honesty and emotion.|Fresh
This is one of the most assured, fully-formed British debuts of recent years.|Fresh

"There will be many people who see themselves in the furtive glances and mud-covered kisses from which ""God's Own Country"" weaves its harsh but hopeful narrative, and they will do so while witnessing a finely crafted piece of cinema."|Fresh
It is, in its way, a very British love story, bursting at the seams with unspoken emotions, unvoiced fears about the future, and a readiness to displace every emotion into hard physical work.|Fresh
It feels like the camera is gawking at them rather than joining them, and so all semblance of reality and of the necessary awkwardness of getting their clothes off vanishes. And so too does any real eroticism.|Rotten
A rigorously naturalistic drama that yields stirring performances from the collision between taciturn demeanors and roiling emotional undercurrents.|Fresh
Skipping some of the more predictable narrative obstacles we've come to expect from the coming-out drama, this sexy, thoughtful, hopeful film instead advances a pro-immigration subtext that couldn't be more timely ...|Fresh

Heartbreaking.. shines a new spotlight on a familiar story.|Fresh
