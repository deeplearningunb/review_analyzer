Nyoni's film has narrative ambiguities but it's a striking debut.|Fresh
If you like things to be spelled out, this is not the film for you.|Fresh
An impressive debut from Zambian filmmaker Rungano Nyoni who manages to keep the film balanced and entertaining with a heavy dose of satire.|Fresh
Nyoni's ability to craft such a multi-layered film and complex film is simply spellbinding.|Fresh
One of the year's very best films. A blast of absurdist outrage that's seriously funny until all of the sudden it's not anymore.|Fresh
Not without humor, I Am Not a Witch ultimately rests on Shula's story, which builds toward a mournful and mysterious finale.|Fresh
I Am Not a Witch is subtly satirical, taking care to underline the performative nature of the witchcraft accusations and banishings.|Fresh
Packs a subtle gut punch by effortlessly mixing absurdist social critique and magical realism.|Fresh

There is a lot to say about how the world mistreats women-strong women-and Nyoni's approach might seem very flimsy when approaching such a large tapestry, but in the end, her film is invigorating and provocative.|Fresh
There are a plethora of elements in I Am Not A Witch that will leave the viewer both intrigued and baffled. Simultaneously mystical, nightmarish, and folkloric, I Am Not A Witch is a provocative allegory for contemporary womanhood and the female body.|Fresh
a powerful feminist message as magical realism, a piece of political folklore resounding through generations.|Fresh
Its oddness makes it a compelling watch.|Fresh
In a subtly expressive performance, newcomer Mulubwa employs a stoic, morose countenance to convey Shula's bottomless well of hurt, loneliness, shame and fear.|Fresh
The disjointed, episodic pace makes it an off-putting experience.|Rotten
A film that badly misrepresents what happens to women accused of witchcraft in Zambia in a bid to exploit the film festival/art house circuits.|Rotten
This striking and original film by a Zambian-Welsh writer-director is a feminist allegory set in Zambia.|Fresh
It finds that rare nexus of the comic and the tragic, underlining the absurdity of a terrible situation without demeaning those who have been harmed by it.|Fresh
Nyoni's frank, confrontational style is both derisive and empathetic; she extracts powerful symbolic images from the oppressive environment.|Fresh
The film is perhaps overly repetitive in emphasizing Shula's inability to escape exploitation, but the story is put across with formal confidence and real originality.|Fresh
At times sincerely moving, bleakly comic, infuriating and heartbreaking, I am Not a Witch is a shrewd interrogation of exploitation, power, gender and national and personal identity.|Fresh
A farcical examination of sexism and superstition, I Am Not a Witch is a strong first feature, mostly successful in its satire but falling a little flat in its final stretch.|Fresh
Overall, I Am Not A Witch is a perverse, absurd and funny snapshot of life in rural Africa which leaves a very profound afterthought on the treatment of women.|Fresh
I Am Not a Witch, the brilliant feature debut of Zambian-Welsh writer and director Rungano Nyoni, is a satire with the haunting, surreal sensibility of a fairy tale.|Fresh
The debut film by Rungano Nyoni is a satirical, brilliant and sophisticated denunciation starring the magnificent revelation Maggie Mulubwa. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A Superb Film From A Prodigious New Talent|Fresh
Zambian directors Rungano Nyoni's touch allows the film to escape a solemn take on this true African reality. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The simplicity of I Am Not a Witch and its musical contrasts seem like they wouldn't work, but it creates an effective thread... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
To say its mistakes destroy the triumphs of I Am Not A Witch would be very exaggerated, bu it's true that they make it a promising debut and not much more. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Writer-director Rungano Nyoni has created a marvellous movie that might not always be easy to watch, but it sparks with artistry and originality.|Fresh
Nyoni not only captures the absurdist processes of this world, with men delivering verdicts on the women, she frames it with compositions that capture both the fierce spirit of her protagonist and the ludicrous situation she must make the best of.|Fresh
In this feature debut from Zambian-born film-maker Rungano Nyoni, ancient superstitions and crass commercialism go into partnership to grotesque effect.|Fresh
There's real sorrow and anger underneath the laughs.|Fresh
Superstition and good, old-fashioned subjugation are the driving forces in I Am Not a Witch, a film that can be surprisingly rousing and entertaining given its extraordinarily grim-sounding subject matter.|Fresh
The bobbins are a brilliantly employed metaphor, something that feels freshly sprung from a fairy tale, only silly until you consider how sinister they are.|Fresh
It's arguable that Nyoni is stretching a thin premise, but this film is one of the obvious breakouts of the year: exactly the kind of young work-brash, committed, and narratively unpredictable-that film festivals are supposed to champion.|Fresh
There are some bombastic aural stylistic choices too, with Vivaldi and Estelle rubbing shoulders on the surprising soundtrack. While the satire occasionally feels too blunt, overall the film offers a rush of originality, energy and ambition.|Fresh
As each new injustice piles on the last, the image becomes ironically imbued with its own magical properties, symbolising the terrible absurdity that keeps beleagured women powerless while the lunatics take over the asylum.|Fresh
Nyoni opts for an elliptical approach that occasionally confuses, but Mulubwa's exceptional impassivity and David Gallego's unsettlingly striking imagery help keep this focused and fascinating.|Fresh
Maggie Mulubwa is captivating as the girl, and the story is an intriguing mixture of satire and tragedy, but the film's carefully artistic style (though an achievement) is at times too distracting.|Fresh
An extravagant flight of fancy that functions equally well as an anthropological curiosity, engrossing drama, feminist allegory, tart political satire and dire warning against xenophobia.|Fresh
Aesthetically brave, narratively chaotic, this casts a singular spell.|Fresh
It's hard to make gripping a character who hasn't found their voice. Yet Mulubwa does.|Fresh
[A] bewilderingly strange yet terrifically sure-footed feature debut from writer-director Rungano Nyoni.|Fresh
But this is still a wildly promising first feature from [Rungano] Nyoni, and marks her as a filmmaker to watch.|Fresh
Her ordeal is depicted with a combination of striking images, social satire and the potent sense of a youngster confronting the injustices and uncertainty of the adult world.|Fresh
Strikingly original.|Fresh
A fascinating witch's brew of absurdism, realism, satire and fairy tale, I Am Not A Witch reveals young Zambian-Welsh director/writer Rungano Nyoni as a blazing talent to watch.|Fresh
Exhilarating, humorous yet still disturbing.|Fresh
For all its satirical elements, I Am Not A Witch retains an air of mystery.|Fresh
First-time feature director Rungano Nyoni has a comic gift, coolly ticking away at the heart of her singular satire I Am Not a Witch.|Fresh
A magic realist fable set in present-day Zambia that has plenty to say about gender and superstition.|Fresh
...a remarkable film that manages to balance absurdity and outrage in a perfectly observed character piece.|Fresh
I Am Not a Witch is flawed, fascinating and disappointingly unpersuasive: partly due to its lack of a commanding stance, a slender narrative and ill governed humour but there are winning moments that derive from some character traits.|Fresh
Mulubwa's sullen, inscrutable Shula is a compelling presence at the heart of the story, but more clarity in explaining her ultimate fate might have made the film even more accessible.|Fresh
A powerful blend of humour and anger.|Fresh
I Am Not a Witch is an example of a fantastic debut. The way Nyoni documents the characters' feminine solidarity and friendship provides the film with an air of triumph.|Fresh
It's rare and exhilarating that a new filmmaker arrives on the scene so sure of herself and so willing to take bold, counter-intuitive chances.|Fresh
The film crafts a framework of superstition and ritual, onto which is hung a vividly realised, if somewhat enigmatic portrait of a child's life.|Fresh
Nyoni has delivered a pulsingly odd and strikingly original debut: a tale of dogma, prejudice and corruption in the country of her birth.|Fresh
A fable-like story about a young African girl banished from her village for alleged witchcraft, it blends deadpan humor with light surrealism, vivid visuals and left-field musical choices.|Fresh
