ZOOTOPIA is not a glimmering beacon of light for activists around the world, but it sure is a nice little lesson for everybody to enjoy.|Fresh
Zootopia works masterfully on multiple levels: an enjoyable comedy, a competent detective story, and a reflection of our world with its various complicated problems.|Fresh
Of all the phrases I thought I'd use to describe Zootropolis, I never thought 'socially relevant' would be one of them.|Fresh
Pixar has set a high bar for films about anthropomorphized critters, inanimate objects, artificial intelligences and abstract concepts, too high for a harmless but only marginally clever time-filler like Zootopia to fully hurdle.|Fresh
It just never fully settles into its own message or visual style.|Rotten
Bateman has never been better... His role has what the whole movie has: gumption, grace, charm and intelligence, against the backdrop of a fabulously imaginative world.|Fresh
It was so heartwarming and fun that I felt a mighty need to share my feelings about it.|Fresh

Sorry Elsa from Frozen, you have been dethroned. The new way adorable queen is a bunny and her name is Judy.|Fresh
Zootopia is actually a thinly-veiled look at diversity... and it's glorious.|Fresh
It doesn't sugarcoat how difficult it is to change our ideas of others, but it does suggest how patently stupid many of those ideas are.|Fresh
It's surprisingly sophisticated, finding new ways to get us to look past stereotypes.|Fresh
Simply know that when you hear how groundbreaking Zootopia is-the reports are accurate; it just may not all be ground you want to break with your child.|Fresh
It's a fun movie...It really hits home with its messaging.|Fresh
Someone needs to break into Donald Trump's home, kidnap him, sit him down in his own personal theater, clamp materials to his eyelids A Clockwork Orange style so they remain open, and play Zootopia on a loop until the themes and messages sink in|Fresh
It's a crazy ride to a world where imagination fuels an entertainment effort like never before.|Fresh
The animation is stunning, the screenplay as amusing as it is clever, and the voicework -- led by Ginnifer Goodwin, Horrible Bosses star Jason Bateman and our own Idris Elba -- is top-notch.|Fresh
This is a new Disney classic.|Fresh
The two leads are a great study of how those who have extreme characteristics - and are natural enemies - can be the best of friends if we set aside our fears.|Fresh
Zootopia appears posed to rule the roost with all members of the family as we sprint free of the Oscars.|Fresh
"From the first scene of ""Zootopia,"" Disney's latest animated film, the moral is made clear: to moralize is good, but to bust one's chops is better."|Fresh
This movie is about as good as it gets in the post-Oscar, pre-summer lull. Actually, it's about as good as it gets at the movies all year.|Fresh
Like The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast - and yes, Frozen - Zootopia has cemented itself as an instant Disney classic that will be cherished for generations to come.|Fresh
The political landscape from which this film was born is apparent almost from the start, and though at times less than subtle with its agenda, it still manages to be an incredibly witty, emotional and entertaining movie experience.|Fresh
Do not be perturbed by the animation and animals, this movie is important, intellectual and hilarious.|Fresh
Zootopia is a bouncy, candy-colored animation, not an overt political allegory, yet it's an apt movie for this primary season.|Fresh
The detective story is actually engaging. It's simple enough to follow (for kids) but complicated enough to offer both genuine surprises and silly amusing detours.|Fresh
Perfect school holiday entertainment for the whole family.|Fresh
Much of Zootopia's charm results from its wonderful animation and captivating energy, but at heart it's the witty, insightful script around deeper socio-political issues which makes it truly satisfying for any grown-up who goes to see it.|Fresh
A smart four-footed spin on the buddy-cop genre.|Fresh
Sure to speak to kids and grown-ups alike, Zooptopia unfolds a poignant lesson about how prejudice can hurt people, but also how it can be overcome. And it does all this in a wonderfully fun film.|Fresh
Zootopia is a reminder of just how beautiful animated films can be. Holy cow, this thing is almost hallucinatory.|Fresh
Zootopia is an exceptional film and -- dare I say it? -- an important one.|Fresh
Zootopia has great voice performances from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman who suit their characters perfectly.|Fresh
Zootopia is a blast to watch, a wonderful cartoon experience with an extra bit of gravitas for spice and flavor.|Fresh
The film's messages -- the importance of tolerance and following your dreams -- are pretty standard for a kiddie flick. But there's a political edge that is very unusual for a Disney movie.|Fresh
An entertaining and endlessly inventive comedy and something with more insight than anyone could have anticipated.|Fresh
[A] colorful, nicely crafted, perfectly voice-cast animated feature.|Fresh
Charming and inventive.|Fresh
Not only does [Zootopia] have a strong plot but also a fantastic message of tolerance and inclusion for audiences of all ages.|Fresh
Directors Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush do a fine job of keeping Zootopia amusing for kids and equally enjoyable for the adults who accompany them to theaters.|Fresh
In its attempt to please both children and adults equally, Zootopia is a failure.|Rotten
...a genuinely charming and funny film.|Fresh
The [DMV} sequence is so funny that it's oddly forgivable that the rest of Zootopia rarely matches up to that comic plateau.|Fresh
...an Animal Farm-type fable about racism and sexism -- a shrewd and timely critique of fear-based politics set in a remarkably detailed, endlessly fascinating alternate universe.|Fresh
One of Disney's best movies in past years. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a total hoot.|Fresh
Zootopia pulls together various elements - a neo-noir mystery, a buddy-cop comedy, and timely social themes - into a mostly entertaining animated film.|Fresh
Using the animal kingdom as a means to convey so much sense about our own contemporary world is a masterstroke which owes a debt to George Orwell.|Fresh
Behind the gaze of an optimistic and inclusive film, we have a great homage to the hard-boiled film noir of the 1940s. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is much too willing to abandon boundless creativity to wallow in an endless succession of overfamiliar narrative constraints. But at the same time, it uses those constraints generally quite well.|Fresh
A perfect embodiment of the kind of fable Aesop used to tell.|Fresh
a fast and funny fable about the need for tolerance and understanding in a world in which fear and prejudice are more convenient|Fresh
Another stellar Disney film that begs for a second look thanks to its evocative overtones and commentary.|Fresh
For all the animal antics on display here, the movie also gently broaches all-too-human issues of stereotyping, prejudice and racism. This is something worthwhile to chew over, even for younger audiences.|Fresh
The dazzling design of Zootopia offers a non-stop stream of invention and visual wit that perfectly enhances a surprisingly involving plot...A gleaming gem of a film.|Fresh
There's plenty of charm and a decent plot to keep things moving.|Fresh
... a deceptively clever movie that has timely lessons for all generational demographics.|Fresh
Zootopia tucks a message of tolerance for other species (and races and creeds) into a cheerfully anthropomorphised view of the animal kingdom.|Fresh
Zootopia remembers the power of George Orwell's Animal Farm and gives it a Disney digital system upgrade and brings it to the 21st Century.|Fresh
Believe it: Disney's latest digitally animated feature is a contra-Trumpian, race-conscious, political-conspiracy neo-noir in the guise of a funny talking-animal cartoon.|Fresh
"""Zootopia"" is a vibrant and smart movie... at times, though, it feels more like commercial compromise than the distinctive art of superior animated works."|Fresh
If the film is superficially great, a plastered-over screenplay lurks just beneath, poking its ugly head out early and often.|Rotten
What's so clever about Zootopia is it takes the normal feel-good positive messages, this time about not judging people by their sex or race, and mixes it with something more mature, a vintage Los Angeles-like crime noir.|Fresh
This is the best animated film I've seen since 'The Incredibles.'|Fresh
'Zootopia' is a brilliant, funny story about bias, empowerment and understanding. And oh, how it entertains while it tells the tale|Fresh
Although it would be stretching things to describe Zootopia as a metaphor for modern society, its underlying message of racial tolerance is a useful lesson for everyone.|Fresh
Zootopia is the best Disney animated movie, either with Pixar or without it, since Toy Story 3 in 2010.|Fresh
It's a bunny movie ... sorry, a buddy movie ... in family-fun land, where the rookie cop (a bunny) has to team up with a small-time crim (a fox) to track down bigger crooks. Anthropomorphic as it is, there is plenty of innocent fun|Fresh
It's a gorgeous film beautifully executed with a story that will have you smiling throughout. Don't miss it!|Fresh
Zootopia, like its protagonist, walks blissfully into a jungle of discourse it has precious little chance of surviving.|Rotten
Done with creativity and wit ... but still has the stridency of a lesson plan.|Fresh
How refreshing it is to see an animated movie that takes the initiative to climb above the restrictions of its formula.|Fresh
The genius of the film lies in its combination of traditional Disney characters and situations with a very subversive storytelling style.|Fresh
The filmmakers behind Tangled and Wreck-it Ralph join forces for this entertaining animated action comedy, which has clearly been planned as a franchise-launcher.|Fresh
It is its own cinematic zooniverse.|Fresh
You may be taken aback by just how good it really is.|Fresh

A pretty sophisticated meditation on race relations dressed up as a delightfully entertaining, gag-packed and inventively plotted police procedural.|Fresh

The latest Disney animated feature may not be a classic but it is full of bright ideas and funny one-liners.|Fresh
The friendship between predator and prey stands as a powerful rebuke to Donald Trump.|Fresh
An encouragingly upbeat celebration of love and diversity in times of hate and uncertainty.|Fresh
The illness in our society comes from the artificial stratification, and defensive denial, of original difference.|Fresh
Cute and clever in equal measure.|Fresh
The voice cast is perfect - especially Bateman - and there are some cracking action scenes too. Superb family film.|Fresh
An animated outing that propels Disney's historical success at anthropomorphisation to new heights.|Fresh
The animation is first rate - fur is rendered so realistically that it could trigger an allergy at 50 paces - but it is the writing that elevates the picture.|Fresh
There's rarely been so much sub in the text of an animated movie, and while it makes Zootopia a surprisingly thought provoking experience, there's also something slightly disconcerting about Disney's willingness to so keenly embrace adult themes.|Fresh
There's a magical moment in every movie of quality, a reciprocal bond between screen and viewer, where your shoulders happily drop, you sink deeper into your seat and your soul secretly smiles because it knows that you are in the safest of hands.|Fresh
It's easy to see why the studio is back at the top of its game and proves its still the master of producing films both children and adults will engage with.|Fresh
For the young and innocent minded, there's plenty of knockabout fun and slapstick humour to enjoy, coupled with a timely message about tolerance and integration, while pop culture references abound for adults and film fans to savour.|Fresh
The fictional universe it presents - a human-free world where mammals have evolved into a bustling, civilised society - is vividly realised, richly detailed and very funny.|Fresh
One of the film's great strengths is the trust it puts in its young audience to decode its complex, nuanced message about the value of difference.|Fresh
Marvelous. A bouncy comedy mystery adventure parable in a fantasy world meticulously and cleverly conceived and gorgeously realized. I adore this movie.|Fresh
This has enough light wit and gooey sentiment for Disney groupies, and yet it does leave many unanswered questions.|Fresh
It acknowledges problems that no bumper-sticker can patch over, and yet it leaves room for an exploration of a seriously charming world.|Fresh
The voice cast are all on enjoyable form, and the storyline, once it kicks into gear, is not simply a vehicle for the message of the film, but an enjoyable caper in its own right, full of motion and invention.|Fresh
Just relish the zingy jokes and in-jokes; a slow-burn dialogue scene with sloths that's an instant classic; the elastic character animation; and the pacy, racy disrespect for PC of all hues and flavours.|Fresh
Directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore have crafted this environment in a meticulous fashion, with a striking attention to detail, painting a comprehensive picture of this universe we're inhabiting.|Fresh
The film gracefully deals with the contradiction between what we feel, who we are and what we let other people see. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
Zootropolis takes the form of a jovial noir thriller, is nicely voiced by the likes of Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin and should go down very well with the smaller viewer.|Fresh
Bright and mostly brilliant.|Fresh
No instant Disney classic, but a fast and furry-ious caper with endless gags, a fizzy fox-bunny double act and Shakira as a singing gazelle.|Fresh
It's a delight. Don't miss it.|Fresh
Stepping back from the movie's key themes, the creative team behind the project deserve praise for crafting a fun, complex world.|Fresh
Much like George Orwell used animals as an allegory for communism and social inequality, Disney has used Zootopia to deliver a story about prejudice and intolerance.|Fresh
A lively and universally accessible story is set in an idealised, human-free future where animals of all species have learned to live as one.|Fresh
Threatens to blow away Shane Black's The Nice Guys for Best Buddy-Cop Film of 2016.|Fresh
Zootropolis has a plot you can really, ahem, sink teeth into.|Fresh
Wildly entertaining.|Fresh
A surprisingly sharp examination of racial profiling, prejudice, equality and stereotyping, and how often can you say that about a kids movie?|Fresh
I mean, come on -- what was the last kids film that stumbled because it was overreaching in its exploration of inclusiveness? Also -- those sloths!|Fresh
The tale of a plucky rabbit and a sly fox, it's also a meditation on human nature, civil society and the politics of stereotyping. And it has great sloth jokes.|Fresh
In this zippy and entertaining children's animation that comes with an unusually thoughtful commentary on inclusion and discrimination, the animals don't just come out in the city at night, they literally run it during the day.|Fresh
A well balanced film with a powerful message and a great story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Gorgeous to look at, clever, funny and with a solid and atmospheric mystery at its core. But there's more here in the film's timely and relevant thematic content.|Fresh
Impressionable kids and adults who swear they're progressive will both take something away from Zootopia.|Fresh

The film is visually spectacular with gorgeous backgrounds and intricate textures on mammals so realistic that you'll want to try and pet them while watching the film. Zootopia is vividly creative and fantastically amusing for all ages.|Fresh
Exciting visuals, good characters, lots of laughs and even a timely allegory about American race relations. (Splice Today)|Fresh
The Mouse House may win the gold for Best Animated Feature in 2017 for this intrepid, action-packed comedy/police procedural parable.|Fresh
"Timely message buoys charming, clever ""Zootopia."""|Fresh
From the enormity of the world building, the slick animation, the enthusiastic voice work done by a sprawling cast and a script that's intelligent and warm, Zootopia is already shaping up to be a highlight of the 2016 cinematic year.|Fresh
What an unexpected surprise, a Disney animation with Orwellian anthropomorphic political allegory and a film noir backdrop not seen since Roger Rabbit was framed.|Fresh
"It should serve as a terrific inspiration for little girls to dream big and aspire high. But the larger message ""Zootopia"" is sending is one of tolerance and understanding."|Fresh
Sure to become a classic.|Fresh
A movie you will tell your friends and family about.|Fresh
The beauty of Zootopia is that you can be unaware of the subtext (as would a child ... or a clueless Trump supporter) and still reap the benefits of an imaginatively designed endeavor packed with huge laughs.|Fresh
Zootopia is a great animated film, but it might be something much more: a clarion call for sanity and understanding arriving just when we need it the most.|Fresh
This 3D animated comedy has the expected combination of kid-friendly slapstick and pop-culture send-ups, but underneath that slick surface it promotes a message of tolerance and empowerment.|Fresh
One of Disney's best animated films ever! Fun for adults and kids alike.|Fresh
With this film Disney has a truly progressive jump with a character who achieves the seemingly impossible by his willpower and intelligence. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Zootopia is to 2016 what Inside Out was to 2015 - a next-level animated feature that gives kids something of substance while simultaneously showing them a really good time.|Fresh
The comic high point is a scene at the DMV where sloths work behind the counter and talk. Very. Very. Very. Slowly. If the movie is overlong because of that one hilarious scene, it was worth it.|Fresh
Disarming characters... multidimensional plot form the core of an atypical Disney movie that's right on the mark...|Fresh
Unlike a certain Pixar property having to do with automobiles, this one warrants a sequel.|Fresh
A rich blend of story, message and entertainment.|Fresh
It's confusing when it starts to feel that Zootopia is working against its own message to get easy laughs.|Rotten
Zootopia is filled with lovable characters and a heartfelt message for kids - along with a layered subtext for adults that is both timely and moving.|Fresh
A funny, beautifully designed kids' film with a message that it restates at every turn.|Fresh
Don't be surprised if Zootopia ends up becoming a kids' detective series, based on how fabulously these two go about working the case.|Fresh
The script is highly entertaining - funny enough to keep the young ones entertained, but witty enough to keep adults hooked and LOL-ing through most of the movie.|Fresh
The cagey and delightful 'Zootopia' is creature comfort in every way.|Fresh
Somehow, Disney has managed to pull off a hard-boiled police procedural thriller about political corruption starring an adorable, large-eyed bunny. As strange as this combination might seem, it works. Who knew bunnies could make such intrepid rookie cops?|Fresh
A buddy-cop comedy crossed with a political thriller and mashed up against a social drama. It's a credit to Disney's collaborative process that the whole thing manages to hold together as well as it does.|Fresh
Teems with sight gags and puns and pop culture references, but it's all an excuse to use the buddy cop genre they way it was always intended, as a form of social commentary.|Fresh
"The computer-generated creatures have smooth and cheerful lines, like old-style ""stretch-and-squash"" animation. The movie is wonderfully fluid and graceful."|Fresh
The motor vehicles department scene alone is worth the price of a ticket. I'm still laughing.|Fresh
It's the best film so far of 2016 and should easily be at or near the top of the list for Best Animated Film come award season next December and beyond. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Stuff, etc. - Also Available)|Fresh
Shows just how far the House of Mouse has evolved from dreamy prince-and-princess fairy tales of decades past.|Fresh
[I]t's dealing head-on -- in that subversively indirect way that these animal-based tales do -- with issues that aren't so easily defined and are far more difficult to resolve.|Fresh
"""Zootopia"" is a wolf in sheep's clothing, a movie packed with talking animals that dares to be something more by offering up a bold little slice of social commentary."|Fresh
Charming buddy-animal story promotes tolerance, teamwork.|Fresh
If Zootopia becomes fortunate enough to fall into Frozen-style heavy rotation for kids of a certain age, its messages of rejecting prejudice and embracing the complicated nature of multiculturalism could do some good for the world.|Fresh
Credit the Disney folks with making what could have been a lecture on stereotypes into one of the more amusing animated kidflicks of recent vintage.|Fresh
Even though Zootopia remains whimsical family entertainment and never turns into a polemic, at its core it has more in common with Animal Farm . . . than it does with other classic anthropomorphized Disney fare . . .|Fresh
It's a candy-coated film that doesn't sugar-coat the complexities of race relations.|Fresh
Lions and tigers and preconceived notions about others based on their outward appearances ... oh my!|Fresh
"""Zootopia"" does have some important things to say about not judging people by what they look like, or what part of the world they come from. Kids will probably nod and embrace that as sensible advice. Now if we could only get some adults to listen, too."|Fresh
Leaving aside amusing jokes about the wolves trying desperately to contain a group howl or sloths working as bureaucrats, animal behaviour is a troubling metaphor for cultural diversity.|Rotten
...a decidedly middle-of-the-road Disney effort...|Fresh
"""Zootopia"" is a delight: It's cute and clever, smart and sophisticated, with plenty to offer children and adults."|Fresh
Donald Trump would scream 'loser' were he to see Disney's 'Zootopia.'|Fresh
Kids will undoubtedly enjoy it, but this one seems meant more for adults who can appreciate its ingeniously fabricated world and its big-hearted ideals.|Fresh
A winning combination of comedy, drama, suspense and thrills that will delight kids and adults alike. It's a potent reminder that we're in a Golden Age of Animation.|Fresh
Disney's 'Zootopia' is wildly adventurous and knockdown funny, arguably the best film of 2016 so far.|Fresh
[Zootopia is] incredibly entertaining in the beginning as we see how different animals live in different parts of Zootopia that feel very human, indeed... It's the dark middle part that is hard to reconcile in a Disney movie.|Fresh
Simple though its politics may be, the film is effective -- and coming from a mainstream studio, it is even just daring enough to make a difference.|Fresh
Everything you could want in an animated film: creative visuals, solid script, engaging characters.|Fresh
An agreeable hodgepodge, at least, one that aims to be not just a breezy mystery, but also a race-and-ethnicity fable.|Fresh
Zootopia is Yootopia if you're looking for jaunty fun.|Fresh
"Bursting with a rich blend of timely themes, superb voice work, wonderful visuals and laugh-out-loud wit, Walt Disney Animation Studios' ""Zootopia"" is quite simply a great time at the movies."|Fresh
These filmmakers cross-fertilize social satire with burlesque, parody, and self-parody.|Fresh
It's got a catchy pop song and a nice message about working to achieve your dreams. But because the directors pushed further- in showing how prejudice seeps into our daily lives-they've made Zootopia a destination you absolutely must visit.|Fresh
This charming, pop culture soaked movie admirably takes on racial issues but sags under the weight of its muddled metaphors.|Fresh
Apart from its anthropomorphic, allegorical angle, Zootopia is also a tale of female empowerment and a classic noir, too.|Fresh
Disney's latest is clever and endearing, but it's the animated equivalent of a pro-diversity pep rally.|Fresh
Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman lead an aces voice cast, playing good-cop bunny Judy Hopps and con-artist fox Nick Wilde, who must find common turf to solve a crime wave in the title metropolis. Call it fur noir.|Fresh
A winning, gorgeously animated story about anthropomorphic animals living in relative harmony in a bustling metropolis.|Fresh
Disney's Zootopia is sweet and addresses social issues with sensitivity. Sometimes it can't quite reach its lofty goals, but it's still wildly entertaining.|Fresh
An indication of what good animation can do in the service of a decent story.|Fresh
This one's both intelligent and endearing.|Fresh
The result is a slam-dunk candidate for best animated feature in next year's Oscars. But the pleasure now comes in appreciating the sumptuous artistry.|Fresh
It's hard to create wonder with animation these days, but with its mix of the detailed storybook, the 3-D stuffy, and the retro-Disney cartoon, Zootopia conjures an animal kingdom that still manages to astonish.|Fresh
In addition to being a crowd-pleasing Disney cartoon, Byron Howard and Rich Moore's Zootopia works as both a nifty detective story and a parable on institutionalized racism.|Fresh
A clever piece of family entertainment that wittily uses whodunit convention to deliver messages about tolerance, self-confidence and friendship in eye-catching fashion.|Fresh
Zootopia might not be the best of Disney's recent in-house movies, but it's easily the most political film the Mouse House has turned out in a good while.|Fresh
Zootropolis is a colourful, creative and charming film, full of wit and invention.|Fresh
It strikes a near perfect balance between fun family comedy and message film, never feeling like it's too much of either.|Fresh
It's smart entertainment that deals effectively with issues of diversity and sexism, while staying light and never preachy.|Fresh
"Easily one of Disney's more imaginative and detail-oriented CGI offerings in a while, Zootopia uses the classic tropes of anthropomorphized animals and comic references to pop-culture touchstones to slyly puzzle out what it means to be ""civilized."""|Fresh
The best animated film of the year, as well as one that conveys a message rarely heard in movies for children: Getting exactly what you hoped for isn't the end of the journey.|Fresh
Zootopia is an on-point commentary about prejudice and racism... [and] it explains these subjects to children better than most parents ever could.|Fresh
An anthropomorphized hippopotamus in a business suit will always be welcome.|Fresh
It may lack the bold, pioneering spirit of Disney and Pixar's best animated features, but it still clears some pretty high bars into the human heart.|Fresh
This animated crime caper comes ready to party hard, but also takes a deep dive when necessary, especially when certain species are treated as threats and cause public panic. Listen up, Mr. Trump.|Fresh
On the surface, Zootopia is a witty, wondrous buddy-cop film... At a deeper level, the film allows parents to bring tough topics to the dining-room table, topics such as bullying, stereotyping and inclusiveness.|Fresh
Funny, smart, thought-provoking - and musical, too.|Fresh
"Combining a surprisingly sophisticated conspiracy subplot ... with unexpected plot twists, insightful character studies, energetic pacing and even a very funny riff on ""The Godfather,"" ""Zootopia"" has plenty to appeal to both kids and adults."|Fresh
A mixed bag when it comes to entertainment value, but for the first time in a long time, Disney's attempting a high wire act with tone and content, making the feature intriguing but not always triumphant.|Fresh
Zootopia isn't tied down to any specific element in our present-day environment, but nevertheless it emerges as chillingly relevant to our time.|Fresh
"This wild and comic political twist on ""Animal Farm"" works for both kids and adults as a reaffirmation of equal justice and opportunity while rejecting racial and gender stereotyping."|Fresh
When the new animated movie focuses on the critters, it's a funny trip through the animal kingdom. What slows the ark (oops, make that arc) of the film is a crime story that's in need of a few more monkeyshines.|Fresh
It's a world in which race does not exist. But species certainly do, and they provide a fuzzier, cuddlier way for Zootopia to get at some thorny issues of prejudice and profiling.|Fresh
Zootopia is one of my favorite animated movies. Not one of my favorite animated movies of the last year or two, or of the last decade, or in recent memory. It's one of my favorite animated movies, period.|Fresh
"It's goofy and joyful. It has an actual message that it's not shy about expressing directly, one that's filled with depth beyond ""be nice to each other."" And its screenplay is surprisingly clever on a structural level."|Fresh
Yes, the adorable factor is pretty high. But so is the movie's IQ. Zootopia is a thought-provoking film about big ideas like tolerance and diversity and rising above your base animal nature.|Fresh
"With ""Zootopia"" Disney has a new classic on their hands, one that combines memorable characters, gorgeous animation, social awareness, and a framework that can be built upon for years to come."|Fresh
Zootopia is a lot of things at once, and all of them are pretty good.|Fresh
Good intentions don't always make for good movies. Case in point: Zootopia, a Disney film with more on its mind than animated fun and fuzzies. So much, in fact, that it loses track of what audiences expect, what they're being sold.|Rotten
Each bustling frame is packed with so much repeated-viewings-rewarded imagery that the screen must be sampled rather than taken in as a whole.|Fresh
Entertaining and thought-provoking.|Fresh
Zootopia is stuffed with characters, situations, culture clashes and eye candy.|Fresh
Wonderfully imagined -- the animators have a lot of fun with the drastic scale and biome differences.|Fresh
If you were raised on Zoobooks and Far Side cartoons, ZOOTOPIA is one of the greatest animated movies ever.|Fresh
With a deep, complex yet accessible storyline married to a visually sumptuous telling of an animal tale, the film is an absolute treat, feeling the equal of any classic Disney flick.|Fresh
By investigating the mechanics of long-held cartoon assumptions (both about the harmoniousness of some cartoon animals, and the characteristics of others), Disney is encouraging viewers young and old to see the world differently and more thoughtfully.|Fresh
The film goes deeper in its allegorizing, tapping into the volatile nature of identity politics.|Fresh
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as its long-eared lead while still brilliantly conscious of social issues, Zootopia represents Disney at its most visually resplendent and thematically ambitious.|Fresh
"Vividly mounted with a breadth of vision worth celebrating. Disney has hit a home run with ""Zootopia,"" a grand entertainment with an ingeniously developed, socially conscious message."|Fresh
"Its earnest ""You can be anything!"" message is heavy-handedly clear, though Zootopia works best as a funny romp that ingeniously imagines a landscape where hamsters can be businessmen and polar bears are the coolest bodyguards around."|Fresh
Zootopia is a wonderful example of how Disney, at its best, can mix its past and present together in a very cool, compelling way.|Fresh
"Right there with the likes of ""Up"" and ""Inside Out,"" ""Zootopia"" is so well done I forgot it was animated."|Fresh
A film with lots of strong ideas that are much needed in times where xenofobia is still a thing. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Zootopia"" dishes its messages the best way possible: colorfully, cleverly, warmly and with humor, all packaged in a strong storyline. It's not among the animated greats, but close enough to certainly be worth a couple hours of a parent's time."|Fresh
A big, sometimes messy, sometimes insightful exploration of bigotry, using animals to preach for a more evolved understanding of each other's innate differences.|Fresh
If Zootopia only reluctantly comes around to its crime-solving story, that's understandable: the good stuff resides in the characterizations and the morality play around them, decrying fear of the other.|Fresh
