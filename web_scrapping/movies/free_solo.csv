"Honnold's incredible skill is part of what makes ""Free Solo"" great, but another part of the equation is Chin's daredevil photography."|Fresh

You don't have to be a fan of rock climbing to love Free Solo.|Fresh
From Free Solo's vertigo-inducing opening shot, to practice runs and the nail-biting climb itself, the film, produced by National Geographic, is suitably awe-inspiring.|Fresh
