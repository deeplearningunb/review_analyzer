The Innocents [is] a strong instance of a movie that - if made by a male director - may have lost some of its thematic punch, particularly in regards to the nuanced and often subtle relationships between the film's primarily female cast.|Fresh
Sturdy and classically paced, The Innocents values the daily struggle of its characters trying to overcome such a crisis of faith.|Fresh
The Innocents is a sensitive and powerful film that is compelling both visually and emotionally, another success for Anne Fontaine and female-centric films as a whole.|Fresh
... testament to history's neglect of feminine trauma.|Fresh
At the heart is a community of powerful women, behind the camera as well as onscreen, a situation I'd like to see more of in U.S. films. Perhaps that's why the movie is so powerful in its ability to dramatize the effects and aftereffects of war on women.|Fresh
Director [Anne] Fontaine maintains a delicate balance between the serenity of the convent and the Sisters' beautiful plainsongs, and the brutal aftermath of the war outside-and what's happening to their bodies from within.|Fresh
The Innocents calmly and intelligently dramatizes this reprehensible victimization too often elided from history. It is, above all, a study of faith and a powerful film.|Fresh
The story unfolds in a somewhat predictable manner, but as some say, it's all about the journey and the art of filmmaking. The film is quite beautiful -- not only is every actor beautiful inside and out -- but the landscape itself has a presence.|Fresh
A very good film, with excellent photography. Music is the lowest of the film, where the main roles stand out. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Getting there isn't easy, for the characters or the viewer, but it's worth the effort.|Fresh
Not only is this Fontaine's crowning achievement behind the camera, it is without question one of 2016's most mind-blowing achievements, and I seriously doubt I'll see many of a similar ilk at any point over the next six months.|Fresh

Name one movie directed by a woman, filmed by a woman, focused primarily on female characters, and deeply concerned with matters of faith. This is a remarkably rare event.|Fresh
