Hail, Ceasar! is a film that contains a true dark humor and it's what makes it stand out. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film is broken down into individual bits that aren't cohesive and don't combine to create a story that flows.|Rotten
Parodying the rich and famous in the Golden Age, Hail, Caesar! is an entertaining satire and love note to Hollywood.|Fresh
The humor is much more subversive than laugh out loud funny. It's definitely worth a look for Coens fans and those who love films in general.|Fresh
Catholics, Communists, and classic Hollywood are all equally celebrated and caricatured in the Coen Brothers' latest comedy caper. After all, it's a Christ tale. And a musical.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a mostly lively, occasionally wandering, usually entertaining and uncommonly heartfelt rebuttal to such complaints.|Fresh
As much praise as they deservedly get, The Coen Brothers don't always hit it out of the park, and Hail, Caesar! probably won't become a classic like many of their other films.|Fresh
A conflicted story that is also about losing faith in established institutions like Hollywood. Hail, Caesar! finds The Coens in a comfort zone all while paying homage to vintage filmmaking with a wink.|Fresh

When you look at this as an ode to the way Hollywood used to make movies, that's done really well, and the performances are off the charts.|Fresh
There's lots of fun to be had here, much whimsy and fun grounded by the serious issues of the time. Ultimately Hail Caesar is a bouncy satire with a heart of gold to brighten February's pall.|Fresh
In typical Coen fashion this film is absolutely hilarious and toes the line between being honestly clever and too cute for its own good.|Fresh
In some ways this bauble is a summation of [the Coen Brothers'] career, a silly, wistful look at what may be their wildest dream: to have been filmmakers during Hollywood's Golden Age.|Fresh
The feeling this strange movie inspires is appreciation, not sheer enjoyment; thoughtful study, not uproarious laughter. The response is aesthetic, not emotional. But it sure does look good.|Fresh
It might sound substantial enough on the page, but the closest thing Hail, Caesar! has to an actual plot has the weight of cotton candy.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a witty and intelligent work that has some sharp things to say about the real nature of cinema. And it also gives one the feeling that Joel and Ethan Coen are making just the movies that they want to make.|Fresh
I won't be forgetting the southern gunslinger turned dramatic actor portrayed by the relatively unknown Alden Ehrenreich, or Channing Tatum's hypnotic, homoerotic dance routine as a sailor.|Fresh
It's as if the Coen Brothers watched TCM for seventy-two hours straight, drank a half bottle of Nyquil and then wrote this.|Fresh
My goodness, this is tedious stuff -- smug, long-winded and, above all, wretchedly unfunny... which in a would-be comedy isn't just unfortunate but pretty much disastrous.|Rotten
It's a fantastic movie from top to bottom, and an utter delight to watch.|Fresh
Complete with a stellar cast including George Clooney, Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson, Hail, Caesar! is gleeful, fun entertainment.|Fresh
Visually impressive, yet lacking the sharpness of writing for which the Coen brothers have become known, Hail, Caeser! is a film of stars, but by no means a star film.|Fresh
The more you know about Hollywood in the so-called Golden Age (roughly late 1930s through early '50s), the bigger kick you're likely to get out of Hail, Caesar!.|Fresh
Creators Joel and Ethan Coen clearly love this distinct era in Hollywood history. What Hail, Caesar! fails to do is say anything meaningful about it.|Rotten
Have the Coens crafted a biting satire? Is this a love letter to classic Hollywood? Is it both? Neither? I wish I could say.|Fresh
The damn film stinks like week-old fish, but that is certainly not its worst crime.|Rotten
At its best parts, the story delights in its self-depiction, even when describing the froth atop a garbage can.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar gives us a colourful feast full of excess and fun.|Fresh
Back in 1991, the Coens took dead aim at Hollywood in the early '40s and hit every target right through the heart. The movie was Barton Fink and that's the one you should seek out.|Rotten
Hail, Caesar!, the new film by Joel and Ethan Coen, is so buoyant and entertaining, so full of vivid cameo performances and visual pleasures that it's almost possible to overlook the heavier themes that keep bobbing to the surface.|Fresh
There are many, many moments in Hail, Caesar! that work great, are funny in the way that only the Coens can be funny, and capture the mood of the era perfectly.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! tentatively nibbles at any form of commentary, mostly choosing to soar high on an absurdly enjoyable flight of nostalgic fancy.|Fresh
Even by Saturday night multiplex standards, the whole thing starts to feel frightfully slight. Amiable performances alone aren't enough.|Fresh
The Coens, for once, aren't interested in plot at all, instead choosing to luxuriate in the styles of yesteryear. Johansson and Channing Tatum get to do glamorous musical numbers; Clooney has a ball with his swords-and-sandals epic.|Fresh
It's easy to be charmed by the gang of actors. It's less compelling to wonder whether Mannix should continue to serve God or Mammon.|Fresh
If Llewyn Davis was about an artist learning to appreciate and collaborate with his audience, this reminds us that before the Coens were movie makers, they were movie watchers.|Fresh
Maybe the campiness of Hail, Caesar! can help educate viewers about the history of gay codes and erotic symbolism.|Fresh
The Coens show their strongest belief, like Eddie's, is an unshakable faith in the power of movies.|Fresh
If you're among the Coen brothers' faithful, you'll find much to admire and gags that hit like a ton of bricks, though you'll probably wish there were more of them.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is finally all too effortful, a doodle undertaken by scholars.|Rotten
A bonkers caper.|Fresh
Josh Brolin is terrific as Mannix. I chortled and laughed through the whole thing. And I smiled for hours afterward thinking about it.|Fresh
Hail Caesar! may not rank at the top of Coen's impressive list, but it should do nothing to sour anyone on their work. My advice: Treat the movie as a smorgasbord. Pick what you like; forget the rest.|Fresh
A middling effort by the Coen Brothers' standards is still a damn good film, and that is exactly what Hail, Caesar! is.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! should be a lot of fun, but is essentially a collection of nicely written scenes held together by nothing.|Fresh
These characters are all fully realized and a lot of fun to watch, but so many of them get just one or two scenes -- especially the women.|Fresh
I enjoyed their films. Particularly the early, good ones.|Rotten
A nice trip to the past thanks to the amazing performances, beautiful photography and light humor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In other words, it's perfect, and like the best of the duo's achievements it's an ending I'm going to be pondering for quite a long time to come.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! imagines the inner dealings of Hollywood during the early 20th century ... But the film's point for these shenanigans is possibly nonexistent.|Fresh
In what could be the most Coen Brothers movie ever, the masters of bone dry irony and quirk line up an all-star cast to pay homage to an era of Hollywood when actors were indeed cattle and movies dripped with glamour and the promise of escape.|Fresh
Instant-classic Coen comedy comments upon, and celebrates, the studio system.|Fresh
Not only is this one of the funniest films of the year, it's an irresistible game of references to classic cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is the Coens' Christian movie - specifically Catholic - in much the same way that their under-appreciated A Serious Man was their Jewish movie.|Fresh
The Coen mix of subtle wit and broad slapstick is all over the film, which hopscotches across stories and soundstages at a snappy pace, and they poke fun at everything except the joy of movies.|Fresh
The greatest thing about Hail, Caesar! is that its loose structure allows the Coens to just mess around with the things they like.|Fresh
The Coen brothers' sardonic revisionism of Hollywood's golden era is, ironically, their most earnest feature, and Universal's Blu-ray retains all of its reimagined classical aesthetic.|Fresh
With a sharp script and an excellent ensemble, Hail, Caesar! is a delightful love letter to filmmaking that blends the Coen Bros.' passion for the art with an exquisite tapestry of characters and storylines.|Fresh
In a way, the amusing, preposterous Hail, Caesar!, for all its arch postmodernism, becomes what it pastiches, resembling the kind of '50s film we can now watch and admire for a kind of cultural reflection without exactly considering it a success...|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a frothy and exuberant, if slightly uneven, homage to the Golden Era of Hollywood, and this Blu-ray release does more than justice to its gorgeous colors and striking images|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! ranks in the Coens' filmography somewhere above The Ladykillers but below Intolerable Cruelty, which is to say it has its moments, but not nearly enough of them.|Rotten
Hail, Caesar! is a minor work when compared to the Coen's recent filmography. But it's not a bad thing to say either. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

The film sometimes loses focus, thankfully you have Brolin or Clooney to save it in those parts. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hail Cesar! might not be one of the best films by the Coen Brothers, but it's full of the grace and charm that distinguishes their movies. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is, all in all, mid-level Coens. But as so many others have noted, mid-level Coens still tops most other filmmakers at their peak.|Fresh
It may not have the intelligence or depth of they best work, but it is a light comedy and a love letter to what they do so well.|Fresh
Rather than talk about the film industry, it talks about an industry of faith. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Coen Brother's most recent film is a treat filled with cinephilia; a splendidly fun homage to post-war Hollywood. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The premise serves to analyze the views about religion and politics in a post-war Hollywood, where McCarthyism transformed filmmakers into ease prey of the anti-communist movement. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's fun seeing Hollywood making fun of itself and even better with the Coen's sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Once again the Coen's prove they're masters of absurd but never dumb comedies. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
a straight-up-funny syncopated comedy about studio-run showbiz in all its bottom-line absurdity|Fresh
The end result should attract and repel moviegoers in the same degree, virtually refusing an easy ranking among the Coens' filmography. Would that it were so simple.|Fresh
Held together by an effective, if downplayed, Chandler-esque crime yarn, it touches on Marxist theory, theology, hubris, and even synchronised swimming. Film buffs will find it a treat.|Fresh
The ever-streaky Joel and Ethan Cohen commit a cinematic blunder with a would-be screwball comedy that has all the laughs you can count on one hand.|Rotten
Mostly it's about the meaning of life by way of religion, with which the Coens have always fiddled, sometimes dancing around the edges and sometimes diving straight into the middle.|Fresh
Everyone seems to be having fun and it translates to the screen perfectly in what is certainly an entertaining production.|Fresh
the Coens at their most and least cynical. Amen and hallelujah. -|Fresh
The result is a warm, funny and uncomplicated blend of satire and tribute, bursting with affection for a medium at the height of its influence, while gently sending up the craziness behind the scenes at the dream factories.|Fresh
A film some will love and some will hate, while others will sit somewhere in the middle of disappointment and admiration. Hail, Caesar? Maybe more of a respectful nod perhaps?|Fresh
Before we know it, the film morphs into a complex fable that ingeniously palpates the thin membranes dividing the tales we've been telling ourselves for thousands of years, from the Bible to blockbuster movies.|Fresh
Fans of these iconic filmmakers should enjoy the ride. Those unfamiliar with their previous work may find it all a bit too strange.|Fresh
The intrigue is engagingly goofy, but the plot is really just an excuse for the Coens to spoof a series of Hollywood genres with gleeful precision. Their pastiche films are a joy, brazenly silly but pulled off with old-school panache.|Fresh
Hail Caesar! lifts the curtain on Hollywood in magnificent style.|Fresh
Embrace the movies, says this movie about old movies, and know that the industry and its popular myths are the 20th century's totems, and that to be the bag man for the studio in such an era, was to be as close to godliness as is possible.|Fresh
If it's possible to create a tribute to popular film that's both completely loving and completely scathing at the same time, the Coens have managed it. It's a mind-blower.|Fresh
An intelligent ode to a time when Hollywood made wildly inventive movies without pressure from focus groups, there's a serious edge to what superficially looks like a madcap comical romp.|Fresh
Its fizzy, meandering, ultimately plotless-plot will frustrate many, but if you just go with it this is one of the most joyous films you will ever see.|Fresh
It goes on for ever and is like watching paint dry.|Rotten
A film jammed with comic highlights.|Fresh
For all its knockabout silliness, the film is a love letter to the movies - or rather, to a dream of the movies.|Fresh
You could see it as a sampling menu for Chez Coen. Like most sampling menus, however, Hail, Caesar! leaves you craving a proper main course.|Fresh
Watching Hail, Caesar! as a classic cinephile, you're going to have a whale of a time; if you're not, you'll probably only manage a snicker.|Fresh
Painstakingly recreates an era that very few people remember with the same affection as the Coen Brothers. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! has its moments of pleasures, but often it leaves you with what Laurence Laurentz asks Hobie to deliver on camera: 'a mirthless chuckle'.|Fresh
Feels as much like a warm tribute to the studio pictures of the Coens' youth as it does an exuberant comedy in its own right.|Fresh
As satirical fantasies go, Hail, Caesar! is so loving and spectacular a celebration of the Hollywood studio system of the early 1950s that it looks like a riposte to 2006's Hollywoodland..|Fresh
A hugely entertaining romp. But Hail, Caesar! also emerges as a smart and subtly unnerving exploration of the seductive appeal of films over its paying audience - over us.|Fresh
Full of the Coen Brothers' usual exuberant joie de cinema, and a helluva lot of fun, but too scattershot to ever settle on saying the things it has to say.|Fresh
A mystery, a farce, a treatise on religion and a sly interrogation of cinemas so-called golden age masquerading as the ultimate Hollywood love letter.|Fresh
As Caesar probably never said: I came, I saw, I slept.|Rotten
The Coens and their excellent cast (which includes Michael Gambon, plummily narrating) have huge, hammy fun with all this.|Fresh
After the Coens' Inside Llewyn Davis, True Grit and A Serious Man, it's great to see them return to lighter fare. Even if this is far from classic Coens.|Fresh
Quite what Hail, Caesar! is driving at will remain a mystery for most (it's well worth looking into this to see what it's all about), but the journey is more than entertaining enough to make it worthwhile.|Fresh
It may not have a lot to say - other than: hey, the movies are just swell - but it's all executed with true love.|Fresh
As for the Coens themselves, eccentric and critical Hollywood tomb raiders they might be but, like Sturges, they believe sincerely in the value of delight for its own sake.|Fresh
Feels more laboured than labour of love.|Fresh
The latest film from the Coen brothers is a comedy set during the 'golden age' of Hollywood and in some respects it is utterly delicious.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! represents a breakthrough for the brothers as storytellers|Fresh
There are half a dozen moments you've really got to see in the Coen brothers' Hail, Caesar! -- more than enough to make this movie worth your while.|Fresh
Think of Altman's The Player; mix it with random pages of Fitzgerald's The Last Tycoon; shake and serve.|Fresh
It's not encumbered with significance, but richly affectionate and very entertaining. Hail, Caesar! is something to be greeted as a gorgeous exercise in style.|Fresh
Beautifully made, laugh-out-loud funny and utterly charming, Hail, Caesar! delivers pitch-perfect Hollywood pastiche in the Coens' inimitable style.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is smart and silly at the same time, a light and frothy love letter to '50s Hollywood which also makes fun of the place.|Fresh
"For all its outward glitz and lush ""prestige"" presentation, Hail, Caesar! is curiously empty, narratively and ideologically. It's also frequently and deadeningly dumb."|Rotten
While there are delightful moments, it's never quite the knockabout slapstick comedy that the trailer suggests.|Fresh
It's a big, swirling movie, shot by the great Roger Deakins, full of movies and the joy of movies.|Fresh
There's an affection for the characters in the film, even the ones they satirize most brutally.|Fresh
...just another promising yet underwhelming effort from the Coen siblings...|Rotten
Hail, Caesar! hits all the right notes as a loving tribute to the films and background players of a bygone Hollywood age, and while it's perfectly enjoyably, it ultimately feels like a slight and undernourished offering.|Fresh
Mostly the film is pleasant enough pap - a soft, even toothless hat-tip to Hollywood's dreamy days of yonder year.|Fresh
The Coen Brothers' 1950s-set Hollywood Studio comedy is an endlessly, effortlessly entertaining flight of fancy. If they only created it to delight themselves - which is how it possibly comes off - I have no beef with that.|Fresh
Charm goes a long way, but in terms of the Coens' overall oeuvre, Hail, Caesar! is endearing but inessential viewing.|Fresh
Constructed from spoofy vignettes that recreate vanished genres, indelible star turns and 'dialectical' dialogues, the movie is simultaneously amused, awed and appalled by the power of what might be America's most influential industry.|Fresh
The Coens' nihilistic fatalism was getting old, so it's nice to see them leave it behind.|Fresh
The elaborate, beautifully slick musical numbers run for minutes on end and suggest the Coen's might have been better off making a full-on, old-style, unironic Hollywood movie rather than an ensemble comedy that merely pays tribute to them.|Fresh
As an examination of the post-war hypocrisy of Hollywood, the fantasyland of Hail, Caesar! is ten thousand times more righteous than the based-on-fact Trumbo. But as a Coen brothers' movie, it's just OK.|Fresh
... It's nice to see the brothers devote their time and energy to something this fun.|Fresh
This is very much a loopy lark concerned with a lost past Hollywood will never reclaim.|Fresh
When it comes to the Coen brothers, you can always believe the hype. Maybe just don't believe the trailers.|Fresh
A prestigious eye-roll at the ridiculousness of looking for meaning in the institution of show business and every 'ism' vying for a stake of influence|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is that rare beast: a feel-good Coen brothers film. It feels very good indeed.|Fresh
While the Coen Brothers don't show any signs of abandoning movies, Hail, Caesar! shows Hollywood on a precipice, and openly wondering if its followers will remain faithful.|Fresh
The wry tone, the dry wit and the sometimes not so dry moment (eg synchronised water dancing led by the irritable (and pregnant) DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), serve as flavouring to this Coen brothers movie meal|Fresh
A burnt out Hollywood Executive, a kidnapped movie star, a tenacious gossip columnist and a study group with communist tendencies are some of the scrumptious characters in this latest Coen Brothers jewel|Fresh
A film that knows how to laugh at itself and those things it represents without being coarse or easy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Every new scene is a surprising delight in what, at the time, appearing as a sunny, screwball satire pinpointing the moment where the Hollywood production line was starting to clank and creak.|Fresh
Has some sparkle as it reaches for a happy ending.|Fresh
Although it's beautifully crafted, filled with amusing detail and in-jokes and cast with the Coens' usual deft precision, it all falls a little flat.|Fresh
The Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, provide an on-target parody in Hail, Caesar!, their funny period comedy set in Hollywood of the 1950s.|Fresh
The latest film from the Coen brothers seems like a minor title, a tribute to the classic films of Hollywood. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Yes, it's funny. But some gags just drag for too long. It's obvious the Coen's enojued making this film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is simply a delight from first to last frame.|Fresh
One of the things the Coens may or may not be ridiculing in this award-season release is Hollywood's earnest faith in itself.|Fresh
Might not be the best Coen Brothers film, and yet it showcases their talent and is a really enjoyable treat. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! ... a slice of Hollywood fluff.|Fresh
A frothy, silly concoction that curdles into a sagging soufflé long before its time is up.|Rotten
'Hail Caesar!' pokes fun at and embraces Old Hollywood simultaneously.|Fresh
It's all nuts, and the actors couldn't be having more fun.|Fresh
It's about putting in everything we know about Classic Hollywood in a single, hilarious package.|Fresh
Fresh and bubbling with personality in places, but lacking that final piece that will bring the picture together.|Rotten
As with the Coens' other films, a single viewing doesn't always reveal what the film's true intentions and meaning are.|Fresh
As Coen movies go, this is one of the most upbeat and optimistic, one of the few to suggest that good people can have happy endings. Classic Hollywood wouldn't have it any other way.|Fresh
It's not as clever as either the exceptional [Inside Llewyn Davis] or the very good [A Serious Man].|Rotten
Hail, Caesar! seems like a lark -- an inessential Coen Brothers film. It's not one of their best, but beneath the surface of this Old Hollywood satire lies a comforting statement from the siblings about their plans for the future.|Fresh
A slap-happy valentine to the Technicolor heyday of Hollywood that lands somewhere between the trippy brilliance of The Big Lebowski and the goofball parable of O Brother, Where Art Thou?|Fresh
Visually the film is stunning, with Roger Deakins returning to the Coen fold with some eye-popping work, the underwater scene and a dusk car scene being particular highlights.|Fresh
"Few contemporary filmmakers create works that require more reflection than the Coen brothers -- and that applies even when they're turning out one of their ""lighter"" comedies."|Fresh
The individual parts are each greater than the whole but I hoped, this being from the brothers, for something the other way around.|Fresh
Few filmmakers working today have a deeper love of studio lore than do the Coen brothers, and here the veteran writer-directors render unto Hollywood what is Hollywood's, and so much more.|Fresh
Somewhat confusing but funny and Channing Tatum dance routine tops!|Fresh
The Coens' funniest film in over a decade, and although the tone is light and breezy, there remains a sinister undercurrent behind the film's glamorous artifice.|Fresh
An in-joke that we can all be in on.|Fresh
Who but the Coen brothers could make a Christ allegory with the Imperial Garden Chinese restaurant as the desert where Jesus is tempted?|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a great surprise for film lovers looking for a mood enhancer in these final, gloomy weeks of winter.|Fresh
It is the best comedy ever by award-winning directors Ethan and Joel Coen, but much of its content will probably go right over the heads of most people in the audience. This screwball satire is both smart, and silly.|Fresh
The Coens are just goofing around with this one, and it's still better than most movies being released these days.|Fresh
Movies like Hail, Caesar! are the reason I will follow Joel and Ethan Coen anywhere.|Fresh
"For all its ""Hooray for Hollywood"" sparkle and highly welcome down-with-Hollywood bile, this dream machine blows its gaskets with too many flat non-scenes, stale jokes and pointless cameos."|Rotten
The Coen Brothers in a gleefully playful mood with a film that at once spoofs and honors the last days of the old Hollywood.|Fresh
An enjoyable, well-made movie filled with amusingly stylized performances by famous actors.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a big, Looney Tunes confection of a movie.|Fresh
In this unapologetically frivolous entertainment about the fixer who has a choice between 27-hour-days at the studio or a 9-to-5 in aerospace, our audience surrogate prefers illusion to reality. And who can blame him?|Fresh
The Coens clearly have something to say about Hollywood's irresolvable dedication to art and commerce, but the uneven, shaggy-dog nature of the film's scattershot comedy buries most of it.|Rotten
Hail, Caesar! is the Coen Brothers at their mildest.|Fresh
"For such a star-studded cast, most of the Coen brothers' latest effort, ""Hail, Caesar!"", falls flat."|Rotten
Not uproariously funny, still the Coens did a superb job of creating a parody that captures the ambience of the era with a light hearted, comedic touch.|Fresh
several humdrum stories do not make for a compelling overall plot.|Fresh
...a meta comedy that wants to deflate the pretensions of Hollywood even as it's giving the movies themselves a giant hug.|Fresh
"Another epistemological prank from cinema's snarkiest philosophers, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a Passion Play played for giggles, with the Golden Age of Hollywood serving as the garden of Gethsemane for yet another in the Coens' long line of serious men."|Fresh
All the watchable performances make this uneven Coen Brothers movie worth seeing.|Fresh
Despite how many problems I had with the film's inconsistent narrative, the Coens still manage to make the overall experience quite entertaining.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a hoot, the Coen Brothers in their most PG Wodehouse mode.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a funny and madcap, if unfocused, farcical salute to Golden Age Hollywood from the Coen Brothers.|Fresh
... obviously meant as a homage to the great Preston Sturges, the Coens' latest disappoints; it's a flimsy, surprisingly dour succession of double entendres, in-jokes, backlot vignettes ...|Rotten
"Unless you have a solid feel for Hollywood history, the Coens are going to leave you completely in the dark. But if, like me, you're a TCM junky, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is going to make you grin from ear to ear."|Fresh
Whenever the Coens produce a breezy and straightforward comedy, many critics and fans grumble that they're simply coasting, they're making movies beneath them, and they're too valuable as filmmakers to simply offer nothing more than nyuks. Nonsense.|Fresh
Ethan and Joel Coen flashback to 1950s Hollywood. It's their best film since O' Brother, Where Art Thou? and when the credits roll we all tip our hats and say Hail, Caesar.|Fresh
The more 1950s movies a person has seen and the greater their love for Hollywood of 60+ years ago, the greater their appreciation will be of what Joel and Ethan have brought to the screen.|Fresh
Hail to the Coens, just for thinking of it.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! satisfies that one criterion that matters most in Hollywood, and will for time immemorial: it's entertaining as hell.|Fresh
How rare to arrive at the embrace of so much joy and enthusiasm in the midst of a perpetual nothing of a plot.|Rotten
This is a mixed bag Coen Brothers comedy that works best as a farcical tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood. Is 'Hail, Caesar!' worth seeing? Hail, yes!|Fresh
Finds a challenging and stimulating way to poke a bit of harmless fun at the brutal hypocrisy of Hollywood's system, while at the same time making it feel like a loving pat on the back.|Fresh
An old Hollywood tale as only the Coen Brothers could tell it. If you love movies from the '40s and '50s, you'll see affection buried within the often uproarious parody of the on- and off-screen cinematic world at that time.|Fresh
With HAIL, CAESAR!, Joel and Ethan Coen skewer and celebrate old Hollywood in equal turns, delivering a screwball movies-in-a-movie picture that satisfies in every particular.|Fresh
The film is often​ sharp and amusing, but it's a doodle in the Coen canon.|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" obeys the first commandment of filmmaking, attributed to the old master Billy Wilder: Thou shalt not bore."|Fresh
Like most of the Coens' work, Hail, Caesar! has multiple levels to nod at and appreciate -- like the cigarette metaphor and the loving recreations of film genres: westerns, musicals, biblical epics.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a bit disjointed and the story fall apart by the end, but who cares? It is an often-hilarious valentine to movie making in another era, and a good one at that.|Fresh
Joel Coen and Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar! is the most deliriously enjoyable photoplay to open wide in what's thus far been a pretty barren new year -- and also a seriously funny comedy of ideas.|Fresh
A light-hearted dramedy about a good man working in Hollywood.|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" is little more than a goof and a laugh, but who better to take you on such a low-stakes venture than the Coen Brothers?"|Fresh
It's scattered, and full of ideas that don't quite connect with each other. But it's the most I've laughed at a Coen movie since Lebowski (FOX 29 Philly)|Fresh
Joyous chaos is what the Coen Brothers harness in their generous-spirited wet kiss to the industry they continue to master and remake. Bliss!|Fresh
Remember movies? The Coen brothers do. Westerns, romances, musicals, dance extravaganzas - the works. (All of which are on gorgeous, indulgent display here.)|Fresh
The film feels scattershot at best. A few moments are fun or funny. Unfortunately, there are plenty of others that simply drag along for too long. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)|Rotten

Hail, Caesar! might play better on the small screen, where you can savor its fodder piece by piece.|Rotten
The Coen brothers' artfully conceived but strained satire of '50s Hollywood gets the look right, but little else.|Rotten
Coen brothers' madcap, funny take on old Hollywood.|Fresh
Perhaps only the Coens, who have made some of the best movies of the last 30 years, would make a movie celebrating the value of mediocre Hollywood schlock.|Fresh
The Coens have laced 'Hail, Caesar!' with enough visuals and double entendres that beg for multiple viewings to appreciate them all.|Fresh
Gorgeous throughout. But the loosely structured narrative through-line isn't all that interesting...|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is very, very funny with two or three of possibly the funniest scenes in the Coens' entire career...|Fresh
While it's not as narratively strong as most of the Coens' other great works, there's a good chance we'll be calling it one of the funniest movies of 2016.|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" is utterly delightful entertainment, eschewing dark moments while teasing big picture ideas."|Fresh
"While ""Hail, Caesar!"" may not rank as one of the Coen brothers' best films, it does offer enough flashes of levity, wit and simple entertainment to have you smiling as you leave the multiplex."|Fresh
The Coens' gloriously goofy homage to the glory days of big studios, big stars and the big wheels that churned out the spectacles of Hollywood's dream factory from a bygone era.|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" remains charming and intermittently hilarious, but there's a suspicious lack of oomph here, with Coen Brothers noticeably winded during this highly specific juggling act."|Fresh
With Hail, Caesar!, it's baffling to see the Coens deliver something with next to nothing at stake and zero involvement from a character perspective.|Rotten
All hail the Coens, but you're OK to wait til it's on Redbox for this one.|Rotten
The Coens rarely bother to craft compelling finales. With Hail, Caesar! they've thrown in the towel on the third act, too.|Fresh
It's boring.|Rotten
If Douglas Sirk had directed a film noir written by Billy Wilder, it might have looked something like the latest thoughtful tangle of philosophy and whimsy from the Coen Brothers.|Fresh
There are an awful lot of subplots and comic characters but none of the actors in this star-studded cast is allowed to build his laughs and the Coens just abandon several of these vivid personalities along the way.|Rotten
Movies are the Coens' religion, and they're two of the best theologians currently working.|Fresh
...like watching Turner Classic Movies while under the influence.|Fresh
Flat-out funny and a love letter to the movies.|Fresh
This is one of the Coen brothers' jolliest and most carefree films - quite a surprise considering its subject matter.|Fresh
It's something like a summation of Joel and Ethan Coen's films: Meaning is a missing frame, human folly is the star and only the dialogue is divine.|Fresh
A hipster mash note to the way things used to be, it will put a smile on your face and keep it there for the duration.|Fresh
Will it rile up your emotions, or make you truly question something, anything, like their best films can do, while still making you laugh? Hail the Coens, to be sure, but in this case, it's questionable.|Fresh
a cool breeze on a sweltering day|Fresh
"A love letter to a silly, exasperating industry ... that nonetheless produces works of art that are mesmerizing, meaningful and, well, ""swell."""|Fresh
They're not the types to go fumbling for profundity, those Coens. Profoundly funny will do.|Fresh
An intermittently effective mash note to Hollywood's post-war golden age.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is an episodic romp, filled with unabashed adoration for the feats, follies, and foibles of Hollywood.|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" verifies a suspicion long held here, that the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, really hate the movies."|Rotten
"There are the serious Coen brothers movies, like ""No Country for Old Men"" and, um, ""A Serious Man,"" and there are the not-so-serious ones. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is the opposite of their serious ones, and it is delightful."|Fresh
The Coens have replaced the acid in their pens with honey, for now at least, and the result is an affectionate comedy that is also one of their most satisfying achievements.|Fresh
Makes for a delightful if forgettable mid-winter treat.|Fresh
"If this were anyone other than the Coens you might think that success and a couple of Oscars had mellowed them. Not likely. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is one of those diversions that they turn out in between masterworks and duds."|Fresh
Stacked with an all-star cast led by George Clooney, Josh Brolin and Scarlett Johansson, and packed with 1950s details about how the Hollywood studio system operated in all its self-indulgent glory in that era, Hail, Caesar! is a sly satire.|Fresh
A brilliant excuse for the Coen Brothers to make sketch comedy out of a series of classic Hollywood genres. I could watch 10 hours of this.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a playful romp through Hollywood's golden studio age when egos and cigars were vast and backlots were filled with divas, communists and salacious gossip.|Fresh
"By now, the Coen Brothers are reflexively called ""quirky."" The only perverse thing about this movie, though, is that it salutes a company man."|Rotten
"In the dailies of Hail, Caesar!'s fictional Hail, Caesar!, a title card reads, ""Divine presence to be shot."" To the Coens, is that a promise or a threat?"|Fresh
Why don't we leave the Coen Brothers' 1950's Hollywood studio comedy walking on air?|Rotten
'Hail, Caesar!' has no lack of star power, but falls decidedly flat in insufferably dull stretches. The Coen Brothers have a rare miss with their Hollywood golden age satire.|Rotten
The big book of Coen characters must be stuffed with ideas, paper scraps jotted with traits and scrapes for the next Dude, Barton or Marge to get into. Hail, Caesar! is what happens when that book is dumped open, contents fluttering into randomness.|Rotten
"Go for the laughs. But don't expect the spell of ""Hail, Caesar!"" to stick with you beyond the closing credits."|Fresh
Hail Caesar! is blandly enjoyable in spurts, based on the strength of key performances, but it wouldn't take much to make it that much better.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! may not be one of the Coen Brothers' finest efforts, but it's nevertheless a fun, charming, and oft-hilarious take on Hollywood's Golden Age.|Fresh
This is one of those movies where the actors are plainly having a great time; they're all terrific and give the Coens loose, funny, deadpan performances.|Fresh
If the Coens embed their japery that deeply, there's more to divine from this seemingly superficial, largely pop-poppy confection.|Fresh
This is one of my favorite movies ever made about making movies.|Fresh
The Coen Brothers have done it again - made an ensemble crime caper comedy that's pure tinsel town gold!|Fresh
"Hollywood craziness would seem to be ideal grist for the Coen Brothers' absurdist mill. Unfortunately, ""Hail, Caesar!"" comes across as far less than the sum of its parts."|Rotten
Likely to fry the mind of anyone who hasn't yet built up a resistance to the brothers' foibles and predilections over the past 16 films, it's easily the most Coen-y Coen movie they've put out. But then, they are stealing from the best.|Fresh
A wild whoosh of Coen brothers wizardry that left me laughing helplessly and filled with spiritual dread. That's the Coens for you. They're indispensable.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! keeps stumbling over its own best ideas as we stop to appreciate them - ditching momentum, preferring gaps for applause.|Rotten
Impresses more as a fitfully engaging exercise than a fully realized vision... But to render unto 'Caesar' its due, the movie does deliver sporadic amusement and a few absolutely spectacular sequences.|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" Hail? No. Maybe a faint nod of mild approval, but that's all."|Rotten
It's difficult to remember a recent movie so tartly on-point in skewering a power-driven industry obsessed with such seemingly meaningless ephemera as screen-credit and commissary pecking orders.|Fresh
If the Coen brothers' dramas are cautionary tales, their comedies are veritable how-to guides for people who can't help but enjoy a mirthless chuckle at the humility of human existence. Yeah, the joke is on us, but that doesn't mean it isn't funny.|Fresh
It's tappy, slappy, snappy and happy.|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" isn't the first time brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have made a dud comedy. But they've never made one that was this half-baked and lazy."|Rotten
"The tone of ""Hail, Caesar!"" is even and assured, yet the comic inspiration is sporadic. Something's missing; the momentum sputters ..."|Rotten
"Underneath the laff-riot and the Hollywood satire, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a curiously delicate film built on profound affection for American movies and the illusions they build ..."|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" is a flimsy construction that depends on a zany spirit and the charm of individual scenes to hold it together. There are times when this begins to feel like a dubious strategy, but each time the movie rights itself."|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! doesn't completely hang together. But Johansson in a mermaid's tail? Really, why else make movies-or go to them?|Fresh
It's both more and less than the sum of its parts, but its never less than thoroughly watchable.|Fresh
"If you still get a thrill from seeing the MGM lion or hearing the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare, then that's - or, rather, ""Hail, Caesar!"" is - entertainment."|Fresh
Somewhere in there are stretches of the Coens' funniest comedy since The Big Lebowski; it just takes a little patience.|Fresh
A New Testament, a riff on the Coens' references, a love letter to a lost age. It's, in short, kind of astonishing.|Fresh
If you're a Coen brothers fan, this is well worth checking out in theaters.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! features two slices of bread, some turkey, lettuce, tomato, cheese and mustard, yet at no point does the movie seem to realize that it can take all of those ingredients and make a sandwich.|Rotten
Hail, Caesar! has just enough entertainment value to merit a guarded recommendation. But [...] it likely won't be hailed as one of the Coens' best.|Fresh
Hail Caesar! is pure Coenism, for better or worse.|Fresh
It's a strange puzzle box of a movie, as impenetrable in its own way as Mulholland Drive, and its slippery, shape-shifting nature defies all of the usual critical assessments, except one: It's worth seeing.|Fresh
Tinseltown may not make 'em like they used to, but fortunately for 21st-century audiences, the Coen brothers can still make an audience believe.|Fresh
A goofy conflation of Coenian elements: the numbskull huggermugger of The Big Lebowski, the La La Land surrealness of Barton Fink, the Old Testament overlay of A Serious Man.|Fresh
"""Hail, Caesar!"" isn't the great film you might like it to be, but it's very, very good fun."|Fresh
Like a long, entertaining shaggy dog story without a punchline...just sit back and let it wash over you in all its witty, if insubstantial goodness.|Fresh
The Coens are less successful at combining those sporadically entertaining elements into a cohesive movie.|Rotten
This is one of those rare occasions where the Coens' aesthetics upstage their writing and unbalance their momentum.|Fresh
Too confusing even for The Coen Brothers - lacks any creative direction and stretches itself too thin and falls apart.|Rotten
Like life, much of what's funny about Hail, Caesar!, the new film from Joel and Ethan Coen, is also what makes it a little sad.|Fresh
"Hail, Caesar!? More like ""Hail, Channing!"" - am I right?"|Fresh
The Coen Bros. spin their wheels by calling so much attention to every stab at humor.|Rotten
"Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the film is the nagging feeling that the Coens do indeed have something fascinating to say about the inner workings of Hollywood, but the flailing ""Hail, Caesar!"" isn't it."|Rotten
One of the duo's most intricately and wholly thematic movies, and yes, one of their least satisfying in its superficial narrative. Also, extremely silly. Even for the Coens.|Fresh
Both a love letter to and a gentle skewering of Hollywood's studio system, a wildly entertaining romp through history that also keenly reflects its present.|Fresh
Too funny to dismiss and too mild to endorse.|Fresh
It's Coen lite, basically, but still filled with their best signatures: cracked humor, indelible characters, and cinematography so rich and saturated you want to dunk a cookie in it.|Fresh
"While individually some of the scenes are terrific, they don't add up to much, making ""Hail, Caesar!"" one of the Coens' lesser comedies, better than ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" say, but nowhere near the genius of ""The Big Lewbowski."""|Fresh
They may not make them like they used to, but at least they still make them like this.|Fresh
A comic fable that's both deftly clever and irrepressibly goofy. It is also, from stem to stern, the sweetest and sunniest film the Coens have ever made.|Fresh
This journey down memory lane is worth the trip but won't rank among the brothers' more substantial efforts.|Fresh
The picture is such an affectionate ode to the business of movies and the potential for cinematic wonder that I'm half-inclined to presume that its flaws are intentional.|Fresh
Another rumination on the distractions that fill our existence, just couched in a film that's catnip to both Coen heads and TCM addicts.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is just one of those things you have to experience.|Fresh
George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Josh Brolin, Jonah Hill, Ralph Fiennes and Channing Tatum must really, really, really, really, really, really love working with writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen.|Rotten
The Coens revel in both the glamour and the squalor of post-war Hollywood with a film that more than makes up in wit and flash what it might lack in substance.|Fresh
It may not rank amongst The Coen Brothers' best work, but few films do. It's still a high-spirited comedy of the highest order, smart and hilarious.|Fresh
"After focusing in recent years on somber comedies such as ""A Serious Man"" that tackled existential themes, the Coens have turned their attention to a zany Hollywood-golden-age lark ... which ends up being consumed by some of the same questions."|Fresh
The Coens' reimagining of a real Hollywood tough guy is interesting for insiders, but in their first order of business, that of making a rousing comedy about the Hollywood of 65 years ago, they've fallen rather short.|Rotten
It's basically a 106-minute in-joke on the studio system heyday, complete with lovely period details of sets, costumes and visual effects.|Rotten
A charming consolidation of their appeal that both celebrates and mocks its target. In short, catnip for Coen fans.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a lot of fun, and beautifully crafted, too. One to savour.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar! is a love letter inked in arsenic, at once celebrating the artistry of Hollywood and cringing at the crass commercialism and rampant phoniness of it all.|Fresh
Set at an ersatz MGM, the film fudges some period details but gets almost everything else right - the studio's rich Technicolor palette, a movie-musical style just teetering on the edge of camp.|Fresh
The combination of the Coen brothers' filmmaking acumen and George Clooney in absolute buffoon mode is again Hollywood magic.|Fresh
An inside-showbiz lark that regards the 1950s studio system with the utmost skepticism even as it becomes an expression of movie love at its purest.|Fresh
"An original, unapologetically larkish escapade. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a blessed blur of movie-style artifice and silly behind-the-scenes exposé of 1950s La La Land."|Fresh
A swing, and a miss!|Rotten
Hail, Caesar! weds the backstage Hollywood shenanigans of Barton Fink to a more manic pace. It doesn't seem new for them, yet as super polished, mannered, slightly surreal comedies go, the movie feels as rare as a unicorn.|Fresh
One of the Coens' most serious pictures, as well as their silliest.|Fresh
Joel and Ethan Coen's idiosyncrasies elevate the film above the level of a mere creative exercise.|Fresh
It's fun and entertaining - no more, no less, no exclamation point.|Fresh
"A day in the life of a movie ""fixer"" forms the unifying bond in a delightful film that satirizes and pays homage as well to 1950s pictures."|Fresh
[It] has a certain buoyancy ... The fizziness, though, proves fleeting, and Hail, Caesar! too often goes flat.|Rotten
