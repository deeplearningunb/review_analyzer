Endless Poetry is constantly engaged in the act of invoking without ever evoking anything. In that sense, its name is just wrong; there's no poetry to it at all.|Rotten
Goofy, uneven, alternately outrageous and charming (when not both at once), Endless Poetry is as good an introduction to his work as any, and it couldn't have been made by anyone else.|Fresh

It's not endless, but it can often seem insufferable.|Rotten
Endless Poetry isn't for every taste, but those who give it a try will find a celebration of imagination from a director whose sense of invention seems unchecked either by censorial impulse or personal inhibition.|Fresh

Sustaining the mood, Jodorowsky once again bathes the feature in oddity, personal expression, and grotesqueries, making this second chapter as captivating as the first.|Fresh
Endless Poetry offers a ribald and revelatory road to poetic nirvana.|Fresh
Endless Poetry is not a movie that has any interest in hiding its metaphorical (or literal) erections.|Fresh
Though a little Jodorowsky goes a long way, Endless Poetry is the director's most accessible film to date. The story is linear and often funny, even if you're not initially sure if it's supposed to be.|Fresh

Endless Poetry eventually, like young Alejandro, opens itself up to the world in all of its beauty and complexities.|Fresh
The director uses a rich color palette to depict his past misadventures, staging the scenes with gusto and populating the indecorous settings with occasional stylized choreographies and a few bizarre characters.|Fresh
