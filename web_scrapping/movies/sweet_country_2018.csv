Uncomfortable to watch, the film works as a distinguished, forceful statement on integrity, authority, and bigotry and is a strong entry for the genre.|Fresh
Warwick Thornton's outback morality tale, Sweet Country, combines exquisite visuals of Australian landscapes with a script that dabbles as much in mythical justice as deeply specific ideas of what this country is made of.|Fresh
"Sweet Country is undeniably a ""feel bad"" movie, but that shouldn't put you off seeking it out."|Fresh
Sexual and physical violence are symptoms of racial hierarchy and both are impressed upon Sam's family.|Fresh
Their recognition of personal errors resonates by showing progress is possible if we're strong enough to embrace empathy over discord.|Fresh
Though it's set in frontier days in the 1920s, hate-filled cruelty and racism persist still and Sweet Country is a powerful indictment of them. It's searing, sensational cinema.|Fresh
Sweet Country is a real surprise. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Australian western is not a gentle sort... Sweet Country, directed with fierce confidence by Warwick Thornton, is a sturdy addition to the canon.|Fresh
A very good film, that as we noted is more than a western. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

A story of racism and violence, poetic, serene and full of fury. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Altogether, Thornton's film is a moody and dark meditation -- a grim portrait of an Old West that will be both familiar and foreign to American audiences.|Fresh
It's deliberately paced yet rewards patience, building to a resolution that's both harrowing and heartbreaking.|Fresh
As harshly beautiful as its landscape, this is a stark corrective to the American western it echoes, and a pragmatic confrontation with the deep, tenacious roots of modern racism.|Fresh
It manages to be both timeless and perfectly of the moment.|Fresh
Thornton sets the stage carefully, sometimes snapping us into flashbacks and flash-forwards that only become clear the second time we see them.|Fresh
Sweet Country is a gorgeous and scathing revisionist western, but one that doesn't entirely trust its audience.|Fresh
Sweet Country shows that the Western is a genre of ideas that's as suitable to modernization in the northern Australian outback as in the ever-changing North American frontier.|Fresh
Gorgeously shot and patiently paced, the tension and drama is punctuated by moments of humour and grace, all soundtracked by the sounds of the native environment rather than a traditional cinematic score.|Fresh
Make no mistake, Sweet Country is a film with fury in its soul, but the execution (no pun) is beautiful, moving, engrossing, measured and surprisingly funny at times.|Fresh
Sweet Country is a somber film, but not a didactic or overly worthy one. It has pace and suspense and a kind of visual poetry in its images of the vivid and desolate Australian landscape.|Fresh
In a film striking for its absence of background music, the story is told through natural ambient sounds and some glorious cinematography.|Fresh
A visually striking film undone by its obsequious indigenous characters. Australia needs a film about native resistance. This, unfortunately, is not one.|Rotten
It's a movie that you really have to brace yourself to watch because though it is an amazing film, the subject matter isn't pretty.|Fresh
A bleak story presented with great style, it's a finely made Australian western that demonstrates the malleability of that most American of genres as well as the impressive gifts of Indigenous filmmaker Warwick Thornton.|Fresh
In a milieu where, the dialogue repeatedly suggests, madness has become the defining condition of the white colonizer, the dispassionate unforgiving beauty of these landscapes-of a country that's often far from sweet-comes to embody its own bleak sanity.|Fresh
Around this spare story...director Warwick Thornton constructs a searing indictment of frontier racism as remarkable for its sonic restraint as its visual expansiveness.|Fresh
[Warwick] Thornton delicately peels back all the layers of Aussie injustice in this film, but what's most unnerving is that the story proves to be so universal.|Fresh
[A] striking film-ugly and beautiful, hopeful and horrible.|Fresh
The film is a meticulous examination of how the dehumanization of Australia's native population bred an environment of cyclical violence and mistrust.|Fresh
With poignancy, grit, and proficiency, it gazes out at the vast Australian outback while also deeply examining the darkness of humanity within.|Fresh
[Warwick] Thornton serves as his own cinematographer alongside Dylan River, and together they capture beauty amid the pain. There's a solace to the landscape's blend of reds, yellows, and browns.|Fresh
[Warwick] Thornton's direction, cinematography and screenplay could not be more impactful or ochre. The ensemble cast are excellent. And the frontier has seldom looked so forbidding.|Fresh
This Aussie western slightly outstays its welcome.|Rotten
Many great films have emerged from Australia, but few as good as Sweet Country.|Fresh
A muscular drama with impressive depth.|Fresh
Rangy and lean as a cattle dog, Warwick Thornton's 1920s-set tale of racial tension and rough justice in Australia's Northern Territory is an intriguing mongrel mix of cinematic bloodlines.|Fresh
Sweet Country's complexity and sophistication mark it as a landmark work of Indigenous cinema.|Fresh
A painfully real portrait of racism in Australia.|Fresh
This is a very accomplished film.|Fresh
The shots of scorched red landscapes and dried-up riverbeds are often rapturous and [director Warwick] Thornton's habit of interspersing the action with quick, silent flashbacks and flashforwards adds an air of unsettling fatalism.|Fresh
Uses western tropes to zero in on the savage racism of Australia, exploring the deep-rooted conflict between Aboriginal Australians and their entitled white oppressors in the late 1920s.|Fresh
It has a power that makes the cinema shake.|Fresh
A film which celebrates the mysterious, harsh landscape and those shimmering horizons of the Northern Territories in what is, aside from taut drama, a work of visionary cinematography.|Fresh
I can't understand the raves from some critics for Australia's Sweet Country.|Rotten
We have no sense of being preached at but the director's indignation and bewilderment at the plight of men like Sam is always self-evident. Hamilton Morris plays Sam with dignity and wry fatalism.|Fresh
Sweet Country is epic and personal, daring to tell a simple story in a challenging, arresting way.|Fresh
The beauty of Alice Springs offers a profound contrast with the ugly acts committed by its inhumane colonists.|Fresh
Described as Australian's equivalent of an iconic American western, Sweet Country is a gripping, moving drama that pulls back the curtain on a darker chapter in our history.|Fresh
Sweet Country may inspire rage and shame in the viewer, but it's not an alienating film. With great confidence, Thornton invites his audience to enjoy a well-told tragic tale.|Fresh
While Sweet Country might have qualified as a far more important film had it been made 20 years ago when the need for such films was far more acute, it is nonetheless a finely crafted film that signals a film culture moving in the right direction.|Fresh
Thornton's long-awaited second narrative feature has strengths of its own, but not the same immediate emotional force.|Fresh
Sweet Country is a landmark work of Australian cinema, even if it lacks commerciality: what it does offer is the diamond hardness of certainty. Few films are as sincere as this one.|Fresh
A piercing, powerful film that deserves to be hailed as a major achievement.|Fresh
It is the voice of a distinct filmmaker from a distinct nation and I'm glad I got to experience it.|Fresh
Sweet Country is many things - a stark western, a gripping chase story, a tale of slavery and self-defense, and a searing drama in which the stakes are horrifically high.|Fresh
Sweet Country [has a] palpable sense of quiet sadness - and anger - sure to move any audience.|Fresh
Sweet Country is a slow burn, an almost meditative reflection on the power dynamics between the white colonialists and the indigenous population they displaced, and the long shadow of our history.|Fresh
The superb new Australian drama Sweet Country does not so much open as immediately close in all around you.|Fresh
It's the indigenous cast, many of them non actors, who take the film to another level.|Fresh
The movie starts with some ugly material, but ends up introducing audiences to a beautiful place, making this tale of the white oppression of the Black body much more than a gratuitous demonstration.|Fresh
"This is a slice of Australian history that an indigenous director such as Thornton is best equipped to depict; only by confronting the racism of a bygone period can we hope to understand why racism is still so prevalent in this ""sweet country."""|Fresh
It confirms Thornton as a perceptive director, one whose absence at this level has been felt.|Fresh
.. this new Australian western plays as darkly and seriously as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, except that this time the forces of violence and retribution are rooted in the soils of colonial racism.|Fresh
It is, on any analysis, a simple story that is elevated by the way it is told...Although I can't say the film carried me away, I appreciate the sincerity and dedication of the filmmaking team|Fresh
Artfully conceived and executed, Warwick Thornton's period outback western mixes potent themes and striking imagery.|Fresh
A quietly blistering portrait of prejudice.|Fresh
Graced by stellar turns from Morris, Gorey-Furber, the Doolans and Gibson John, Sweet Country succeeds most in lending its Aboriginal cast a sense of dignity.|Fresh
Visually arresting, well-acted and carried by a layered story with cataclysmic consequences, Sweet Country is great example of what Australian cinema has to offer.|Fresh
[Warwick] Thornton is exceptionally skilled at intertwining genre, formal innovation, and political revisionism; what finally undermines Sweet Country is that his skill does not extend to more fully depicting Aboriginal women.|Rotten
"""Sweet Country"" is a western in iconography and spare, taciturn tone, but it is also an incendiary slave narrative, in which the poetry of the filmmaking can barely contain a simmering fury and disgust at this most shameful of human institutions."|Fresh
A provocative, politically sophisticated look at a history of Australia that has been proverbially whitewashed from general discourse.|Fresh
Every frame is meticulously composed to reveal power structures.|Fresh
Old Testament cinema, with an almost biblical starkness in its cruelty and mysterious beauty, set in a burning plain where it looks as if the sun-bleached jawbone of an ass could at any moment be picked up and used as a murder weapon.|Fresh
Sweet Country won't satisfy anyone's thirst for old-school gunslinging fun. But it has its own hypnotic mood and flavor: that familiar Ozploitation feel for the nebulous boundary between civilization and the anarchic wild.|Fresh
A film that will inspire audiences with a feeling of righteous fury and national pride. Must see!|Fresh
The story is both fresh and archetypal; the landscape both hard and delicate - and beautifully observed.|Fresh
Sweet Country is a hoarsely angry film, a powerful denunciation of the racism and violence on which modern Australia was eventually founded.|Fresh
The spare, classical chase drama that ensues is seeded with barbed observations on colonialism, cultural erasure and rough justice, kept poetically succinct by Thornton's lithe, soaring visual storytelling.|Fresh
A drama of imposing breadth and emotional depth.|Fresh
