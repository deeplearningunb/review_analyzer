It's doubtful that Vertigo can take equal rank with the best of the Hitchcock studies -- it has too many holes -- but it assays high in visual confectionary of place, person and celluloid wiles.|Fresh
"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is an artistic triumph for the master of mystery."|Fresh
It's as much a wonder of suspense as it is a catalogue of the director's themes and an allegory for his own art of enticement-and for the erotic pitfalls of his métier.|Fresh
Hitchcock's most tender story.|Fresh
The old master, now a slave to television, has turned out another Hitchcock-and-bull story in which the mystery is not so much who done it as who cares.|Rotten
One of the landmarks -- not merely of the movies, but of 20th-century art.|Fresh
Audiences and critics in 1958 were not prepared to deal with the kind of twisted darkness Vertigo presents so clearly ... but hopefully we're all grown up now and able to deal with it.|Fresh
A film totally in thrall to the lure/peril of looking, and filmed almost entirely from the perspective or emotion of the subconscious.|Fresh
Combines in an almost unique balance Hitchcock's brash flair for psychological shocks with his elegant genius for dapper stylishness.|Fresh
A dizzying cinematic experience.|Fresh
Hitchcock's film is distinctive, above all else, because it is the only one in his long catalogue without a scornful mask separating the obsessions from the vulnerabilities, and into the frames he pours the living essence of his timeless panache.|Fresh
The tempo may be generally very slow, but it is not monotonous; the camera work may be unostentatious but it is quietly, calmly efficient in establishing character, atmosphere, and uncertainty.|Fresh
At the risk of sounding slow-witted, I must complain that Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo was a little too difficult for me.|Rotten
The best film in the history of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In Vertigo, Hitchcock completely transcends barriers of generic making the film into something enigmatic and impossible to classify. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Vertigo ultimately comes off as a fairly disastrous misfire that's almost entirely devoid of engrossing, attention-grabbing elements.|Rotten
The most complex film made by Alfred Hitchcock.|Fresh

Must-see Hitchcock thriller for any classic movie bug.|Fresh
"""Vertigo"" is Alfred Hitchcock's beautifully stylized psychological thriller about a man in love with a fetishized romantic fantasy invented by another man."|Fresh
Technically well made, but there are a plethora of more entertaining Hitchcock films available.|Fresh
Vertigo is a kind of consummate illusion--tantalizing for being so often out of reach (DVDs don't match the reel deal), fulfilling only for bringing us as close as possible to Hitchcock's head and heart in Frisco circa '58. Or...|Fresh
a disturbing and darkly revealing psychological thriller|Fresh
After it, Psycho and the rest of the '60s are only a bitter précis of this thesis of sexual disassociation and identity politics.|Fresh
Why is this movie Hitchcock's masterpiece? Because no movie plunges us more deeply into the dizzying heart of erotic obsession.|Fresh
"The ""Vertigo"" shot created for this film was so powerful and unique that everytime I see it used today, I get teary eyed."|Fresh

Hitchcock was elsewhere an entertainer, often a great one, but Vertigo finds him working as an artist...|Fresh
Alfred Hitchcock at his most disturbing.|Fresh
A rich, resonant meditation of male romantic obsession ... Not only does Hitchcock demonstrate a total mastery of cinematic point-of-view, but he turns what might have been mere melodrama into film poetry. Perhaps his greatest film.|Fresh
Slow but totally compelling.|Fresh
Hitchcock's twisty, suspenseful tale is far more involving and memorable than most recent Hollywood thrillers.|Fresh
What can one say? Exquisitely controlled, framed, scored, acted, and edited. A peerless triumph.|Fresh
|Fresh
Often imitated, never duplicated.|Fresh
Justifying Vertigo's poor initial performance, it is a film that requires distance, as well as the completion of Hitchcock's career. It is a moment of acknowledgment in the final, retrospective establishment of the director's frequent themes.|Fresh

|Fresh
This is one of the single most masterful pictures ever made.|Fresh
What a perverse little gem this is.|Fresh
Pure Hitchcock.|Fresh
James Stewart, on camera almost constantly, comes through with a startlingly fine performance as the lawyer-cop who suffers from acrophobia.|Fresh
Do yourself an aesthetic favor: Take the plunge.|Fresh

One of the everlasting Hitchcockian masterpieces.|Fresh
Alfred Hitchcock's control of the audience is most complete in Vertigo.|Fresh
This is a great, well-made film that deserves every bit of recognition that has been heaped upon it.|Fresh
You watch this guy going slowly over the brink and realize, good grief, this is Jimmy Stewart.|Fresh
Bernard Herrmann's eloquent score is among his finest, Stewart is excellent, as always, and Kim Novak is surprisingly effective in her role, another of Hitchcock's icy blondes.|Fresh
Everything is perfect in Vertigo.|Fresh
It may not be as funny or light as the best known of Hitchcock's work but this is certainly a classic largely because of it's impressively unlikeable, intense characters so at odds with Hitch's trademark Hollywood glamour films of the same time.|Fresh
The film is not really a great suspense film, but really a fantastic introspective drama into the mind of a person much like the master of suspense himself.|Fresh
Jimmy Stewart never did finer work, and Hitchcock's masterpiece, though its meaning may be lost on many, reveals a man at his most obsessed.|Fresh
With this masterfully conceived spine-tingler, Alfred Hitchcock once again affirms his standing as movieland's king of the suspense-drama|Fresh
There is a glumness to the film that is notably missing from the director's other films of the period.|Fresh
The film is a magnificent technical achievement.|Fresh
Vertigo (1958) is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most powerful, deep, and stunningly beautiful films (in widescreen 70 mm VistaVision) - it is a film noir|Fresh
One of the things that still amazes me about this movie is the way its study of obsession is so single-minded.|Fresh
The entire film, its bright San Francisco locations given a gauzy veil of unreality by cinematographer Robert Burks, is steeped in portentous melancholy.|Fresh
Hitchcock seems to have been motivated by personal demons here.|Fresh
The ending of the show is perfect and shocking if you have never seen it before.|Fresh
The most-discussed work of the master; despairingly sardonic and demanding of multiple viewings.|Fresh
Hitchcock's most disturbing masterpiece.|Fresh
Vertigo is a fine film, but it's not flawless.|Fresh
Once seen, never forgotten.|Fresh
From a craft standpoint, Vertigo represents the director in peak form.|Fresh
In its dark heart, the film is a sorrowful contemplation of love and the veils that manipulate sexual passions.|Fresh
Vertigo is Hitchcock's stirring parable of love and death.|Fresh
The lure of death, the power of the past, the guilty complicity of a clean-cut hero, the near-fetishistic use of symbol and color: these Hitchcock hallmarks are all mesmerizingly on view.|Fresh
It is about how Hitchcock used, feared and tried to control women.|Fresh
Vertigo stands as one of the thrill master's most psychologically dense and twisted works in which obsession, commitment, and dual identities all merge to create a voluptuous tale of thwarted love.|Fresh
It tests our patience, but then rewards it, not only with beauty and terror, but also with an emotional sucker punch that has yet to be equaled.|Fresh
