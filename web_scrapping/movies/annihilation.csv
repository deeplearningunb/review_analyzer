Garland creates a wildly surreal and frighteningly real space, where everything's caught in the cyclical flow of nature between creation and destruction, life and death.|Fresh
A sci-fi horror film with a lot more emphasis on the sci-fi rather than the horror, and it's very good!|Fresh
There is a sequence that is as creepy and terrifying as any sequence I've seen in the last four or five years.|Fresh
Alex Garland's  Annihilation is an excepcional and surreal science fiction film that reflects deeply about life, death and facing otherness with paranoid dread. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Annihilation is filled with terror, massive filmmaking on a grand scale, and it doesn't look down its nose at its genre. You'll be in awe of its wonder.|Fresh
It's all a metaphor involving a small group of suicidal women who are sent to on the most a critical planet saving mission. The movie like the mission was never going to succeed.|Rotten
It was pretty but kind of a grueling experience and for what?|Rotten
Science fiction taken to a weird core of horror. Insanely weird and visually stunning. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
Annihilation is an ambitious and intellectual film that matches its rich themes of environmentalism, memory, and self-destruction with visceral horror and an emotional sucker punch of an ending.|Fresh
It's excellent, a moviegoing experience unlike anything we're likely to see again anytime soon.|Fresh

It's excellent, a moviegoing experience unlike anything we're likely to see again anytime soon.|Fresh
Fusing elements of Alien, Predator and Arrival, Annihilator is a dark-tinged equation whose resolution whets our appetite for the upcoming sequels.|Fresh
It's worth a watch in theaters, but I would just caution to expect for a very heavy, and thought-provoking film.|Fresh
Portman's trek might as well be across the landscape of genre history: It begins with a pulp-magazine-worthy attack by a monster alligator and ends with a trippy '2001'-like alien encounter.|Fresh
Concept aside, it's Mark Digby's production design and Rob Hardy's cinematography that really make the film, along with an atmospheric score...|Fresh
No film this year burrowed deeper into my consciousness this year than ANNIHILATION. Top that truly mindbender of a plot with excellent acting, beautiful visuals, and an awesome score and you have film at the height of its power.|Fresh
Allusions to the ritual of spirituality and the doctrine of science, from sinners to global warming to feminism to gender roles. The aspirations are grand, but what does it all mean?|Fresh
It's an odd, intoxicating film with a score that will invade your bloodstream, a breathtaking third act, and a puzzle-box ending that rewards multiple viewings.|Fresh
Annihilation is a darn fine work of science-fiction cinema, one that steadily improves as its plot gets increasingly weird, unhurried, and abstract.|Fresh
The visuals are stunning, the performances strong, but I found the final act underwhelming and a bit less interesting than I would have liked. Annihilation is good but I'm not sold on its greatness.|Fresh
The ending is so exhilarating that it made me forget about every flaw that came before it.|Fresh
This film is ambitious, messy, moving, horrifying, and often times incomprehensible. Each layer is slowly revealed until it gets to the glowing center and there is nothing you can do but shield your eyes from the light of its revelations.|Fresh
A horticultural dream and a zoological nightmare, Garland's terrifying film gets under your skin, leaving lots of unanswered questions. The performances, even up against its grand and unknowable ideas, lift it even higher.|Fresh
Annihilation is a fascinating exploration of vibrant and captivating ideas that will challenge filmgoers in the best ways possible.|Fresh
Garland creates an atmosphere which feels deliberately distorted and diaphanous, as if we are viewing the world through a soap bubble...|Fresh
Alex Garland's Annihilation is a mind-bending, visually transfixing, and narratively compelling film that will leave you unsure of what you just watched.|Fresh
Annihilation is a visionary film that pushes the boundaries of the human imagination. Garland has yet again proven that he is not only a talented screenwriter, but an even more talented director.|Fresh
Marries elements of smart science fiction and toe-curling stabs of horror to tell a heady, intellectual creation myth.|Fresh
Generally speaking, Garland manages his genre/arthouse balancing act smoothly without undervaluing either aesthetic.|Fresh
It's smart, it's gorgeous looking, full of great actors and well directed with a uniquely-elusive tone between Andrei Tarkovsky, Ken Russell and Alan Moore's Swamp Thing|Fresh
Between the creatures and the bizarre landscapes within the Shimmer, Annihilation is filled with striking and horrific visuals unlike any science fiction film of recent memory|Fresh
This movie is phenomenal.|Fresh
Alex Garland's Annihilation does what most sophomore directorial efforts tend to do: get bigger, more ambitious, and a little more complicated.|Fresh
It will either encapsulate you or bore you to tears, luckily I found it to be pretty damn good.|Fresh
I admire its sophistication and ability to tell such a human story with so much intelligence, taking on issues of the Anthropocene with a dexterous and effulgent vision.|Fresh
Annihilation may be the scariest horror film of 2018, or is it too intellectual for audiences?|Fresh
Garland displays an ability to mix big ideas, stunning sci-fi, incredible images, and gruesome violence in a way that few can.|Fresh
The ambitious nature of the film is present early, and the structure's unconventional nature gives him the ability to inform the audience of backstory at his own pace.|Fresh
A weirdly brainy and scary film.|Fresh
I appreciated how Garland tried to shoot higher, but I don't think he stuck the landing at all.|Rotten
It's beautifully shot, and the score really adds something to it...the ominous tone throughout this film adds something to it, though it is a little too long.|Fresh
Annihilation won't be for everyone, but those willing to give it a chance will be treated with sci-fi they can sink their teeth into a la Arrival or Under the Skin.|Fresh
Annihilation is part of that rare sci-fi breed, like Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival before it, the film uses an improbable and far-fetched future to explore humanity from a new perspective...|Fresh
It's a thrilling, original, relentlessly disquieting existential nightmare of a movie.|Fresh
It's an exploration of the weight of our own mistakes. How the choices we make, and the things we can't change, fundamentally change us.|Fresh
Unfortunately for me, it was more bad than good.|Rotten
This is a movie that is more about thinking than twists, about its ideas rather than its special effects (although they are beautiful). It is directed with patience and a command of tone.|Fresh
Has enough star power who all give great performances along with a visual splendor from beginning to end.|Fresh
Annihilation is a visceral sensory experience that chills the blood and makes the skin crawl (literally), leading to a bravura conclusion that would make Tarkovsky proud and any jaw drop.|Fresh
At best, it revels in a sense of creeping dread, loss of ownership over yourself, and the fear of experiencing without understanding.|Fresh
"Due to a mercifully sane run length, I think it would actually benefit from multiple viewings. ""Annihilation"" is cerebral, but even more, it is fleshy and makes your skin crawl, and those moments are even more effective than the mind-bending ones."|Fresh
"Through most of the film, you spend your time wondering, ""why don't they just...?"" and ""Who would really do that?"""|Rotten
There are many questions raised in this enthralling psychological drama that begins with a meteor strike, a shimmer and a secret mission to a terrifying but wondrous world where astonishing possibilities are on display. Don't miss it!|Fresh
... it's a film so unexpectedly unique that it deserves to be seen by everyone at least once.|Fresh
"Despite its fine acting and intellectual ambitions, ""Annihilation"" still delivers its genre thrills."|Fresh
Natalie Portman and her team at least escape the mommy-ism of Gravity and Arrival, in which sci-fi heroines had to fret over their children. What they don't escape is the rampant backstory-mongering of genre movies starring women.|Rotten
Annihilation is the real deal, doing what science fiction and horror are supposed to do, speaking dark truths about our condition while planting seeds of dread in fertile imaginative soil.|Fresh
Definitely fills the void for fans of vague universal doom and evolutionary paranoia.|Fresh
Here is a movie so thoroughly realized, so utterly entrenched in the harrowing ordeals of its characters, that their struggles touch on the very nervous system of our need to endure.|Fresh
The visuals are astounding, and the when the story dives headlong into examinations of self and self-destruction, the movie really takes a leap.|Fresh
Annihilation only gets better and more thought-provoking with each viewing, and Paramount's Blu-ray, which is most notable for its reference-level soundtrack, stays true to the film's mutative beauty.|Fresh
This train wreck substitutes incoherence for cosmic mystery. My advice is to read Jeff VanderMeer's novel, watch Alex Garland's first movie Ex Machina, and pretend that the movie version of Annihilation never happened.|Rotten
[Garland] has made a film that lingers in the mind, despite its flaws. I'll happily make a repeat visit to the Shimmer, looking for more answers.|Fresh
an absorbing, frequently powerful, and at times insightful film that smartly deploys its sci-fi trappings to keep us engaged while leaving us with just the right touch of ambiguity to chew on afterwards|Fresh
Alex Garland beautifully subverts cliches of both fantasy and horror genres, making a film that gets under the skin to properly freak us out|Fresh
A gripping sci-fi spectacular that's richly designed and filled with modest philosophical questions.|Fresh
Garland has built a perturbing allegory to process the anxieties of living in a world where the technological links appear to prefer totality over the individual. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A potent and suspenseful trek into heady sci-fi.|Fresh
The ending, cryptic, meaningless and with the worst CGI of the entire film, buries it all and confirms any doubts; the film is a robbery that looks more interesting than it is. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Garland, well supported by the imaginative production design Mark Digby and the work of five special effects companies, has directed a worthy film of adventure, horror and existential reflection. (In Spanish)|Fresh
Wildly ambitious, occasionally alienating, and consummately perplexing; an irritant to the mind and spirit that demands self-reflection.|Fresh
Absorbing and hypnotic, Annihilation is the best kind of sci-fi film - the kind that challenges and subverts the genre, all the while introducing new ideas that you'll see in films to come.|Fresh
It's certain that the astonishing special effects would have worked better on a larger cinema screen, and it's a shame to lose their impact. But the dialogue is clunky and the plot disjointed.|Rotten
Annihilation is almost certainly a film which will demand and reward repeated viewings.|Fresh
Intelligent, original and exactly what Hollywood really needs right now.|Fresh
...it's a film that makes people think, meditate. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...the most Carpenterian film in recent years. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film intelligently plays between the past and the present, in both cases with exceptional art direction. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Annihilation is a great movie; complex, polyhedral and open to new readings in subsequent viewings. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The more familiar aspects of Annihilation are enlivened by the entirely female dynamic, who seldom conform to simplistic group archetypes.|Fresh
"Rich and intriguing, with many memorable tableaus and at least one outstanding sequence, destined to be known henceforth as ""the chair and the bear""."|Fresh
An exciting, imperfect genre success.|Fresh
A challenging sci-fi masterpiece that demands multiple viewings.|Fresh
Gina Rodriguez steals the show with a standout performance.|Fresh
Annihilation is science fiction that is unashamed to be weird and disturbing. There's a market for that, though it may not be a mass one.|Fresh
"Tantalizing ""Annihilation"" fails to come together."|Rotten
A science fiction that combines aliens and monsters to discuss depression, suicide and self-transformation. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
It's audacious stuff, topped by a lovely twist ending, and deserving of more than a casual skim through on an iPad.|Fresh
[It] may feel familiar but in ways that are intentionally unsettling.|Fresh
Well-done science fiction, artful and glimmering special effects, a script that unfolds its secrets carefully so that you are constantly surprised at each new revelation and, finally, a delicious sense of creepiness throughout, I highly recommend this.|Fresh
... an ambitious film with a fabulous feminine ensemble, solid ideas, diluted in the imperious need to be condescending with the audience... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
You're left feeling that somewhere there's a killer punch that never gets unleashed. Still, if you're a Netflix subscriber, this is an agreeable little bonus package.|Fresh
An extraordinary work of science fiction that owes a great debt to Tarkovsky... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film might lose a certain humanism in its devotion to such formalism, and the very underhanded, un-Tarkovskian way it doesn't explicitly ask the questions it is asking, but Annihilation isn't defiantly anti-humanist, either.|Fresh
Writer-director Alex Garland is certainly carving out a niche for himself, with movies in which people literally carve into themselves (or others) to check if they're still human.|Fresh
Highly recommended viewing, a patient puzzler that invites comparisons to Solaris and Arrival in how it sees the deeply personal collide with the incomprehensible.|Fresh
Once again, Garland offers a provocative and reflective take on the apocalypse, with better-than-blockbuster special effects realized on a relatively low budget.|Fresh
Garland's vision extols each theme with a detailed staging in which it seems that very few things are left to chance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Drawing on mythology and body horror, Annihilation is an intelligent film that asks big questions and refuses to provide easy answers. Sci-fi at its best.|Fresh
It's one of the most stunning displays of directorial vision in recent memory, sure to be a classic of the genre in the years to come.|Fresh
A spectacular work of science fiction that not only gets under your skin but it becomes part of it.|Fresh
The movie's tug-of-war between thrills and fuzzy philosophical waxing results in something much too close to a zero-sum game.|Rotten
"Paramount executives were concerned Garland's movie was ""too intellectual"" and ""too complicated"" to appeal to wider audiences. What rubbish - Annihilation is the thrilling, smart science-fiction movie you need in your life..."|Fresh
Quietly, pervasively uncomfortable.|Fresh
Portman's high-tension acting, her inability to relax, suits the material down to the ground. It's one of her best performances ...|Fresh
the kind of allegorical, even spiritual, sci-fi found in Solaris and Stalker, or, more recently, in Imitation Girl, in which characters are on a quest to find their identity in alterity, their self in otherness, & their innermost being in the alien.|Fresh
A provocative, brainy sci-fi/horror spectacle, that lingers for quite some time. Can't wait to see it again. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This sci-fi/horror hybrid is brainy, challenging, and experimental. Those shouldn't be dirty words.|Fresh
This movie is crazy...I like horror movies, and this movie scared me so, so much.|Fresh
A film this meticulous and poignant will have a life of its own, because it is about life itself.|Fresh
This is a film that, while gorgeous on a surface level, becomes something far more impressive as the layers are peeled away.|Fresh
Annihilation does offer enough surreal horror within its visual spectacle to make it worth recommending to sci-fi fans, but I can't help but feel that it is fairly empty thematically.|Fresh
...like all the best horror, Annihilation is steeped in character, mood, and ideas.|Fresh
That verdant blend of Giger and Carpenter is fantastic, but what will really stay with you is the effect all this has on the characters.|Fresh
Though the film veers away greatly from the original text, the dreamy ambience of the book is very much intact.|Fresh
Top-notch sci-fi and a chilling allegory for humanity's capacity for self-destruction.|Fresh
Garland's ambition occasionally outstrips his execution but Annihilation is nonetheless proper, intelligent sci-fi.|Fresh
'Annihilation' draws you in, teasing you with hints, but - like many recent science fiction offerings - frustrates audiences by obscuring its answers and cloaking them in ambiguity.|Fresh
2018's first masterpiece.|Fresh
What this movie does have are some solid characters. These are soldiers in a war against an unknown enemy. Like a band of brothers in a war movie, the team forms its own identity, based on the personality of its leader and its members.|Fresh
Annihilation is sad, upsetting, scary, mystifying, and destined for debate.|Fresh
Sinister, shimmering sci-fi thriller that challenges audiences with cosmic molecular science....|Fresh
A strangely intoxicating mind-trip of an adventure that relies more on sound, feel, and sight than it does on providing answers to the perplexing questions at its heart|Fresh
Here as in Ex Machina (2015), Garland's creative élan comes from his merging of sleek conceptual art and messy, juicy drama.|Fresh
Garland, one of the smartest directors making speculative fiction films today, fills his screen with terrible beauty.|Fresh
You might like this misguided mess of a fantasy if you like movies that keep their secrets so well, for so long, that the stakes lessen and you stop caring.|Rotten
Unlike most simplistic, tidy, instantly disposable Hollywood sci-fi fare, this one doesn't spoon-feed. It Kubricks us.|Fresh
[Alex Garland has] perfected an atmospheric cocktail of foreboding music, the threatening half-dark of twilight, and mysterious characters who bury secrets.|Fresh
What's impressive is Annihilation's willingness and ability to evoke the soul-sickness that leads to great moments of art, great moments of self-destruction, and an equation of the two.|Fresh
"""You don't get it"" is a more strategic posture than ""Nothing to see here."" But the latter is where I ended up, exhausted by the journey and bored by its conclusions."|Rotten
Writer/director Alex Garland delivers a striking and impressively captivating opening stretch that instantly captures the viewer's attention and interest...|Fresh
There's some grisly predation-metastasized nature's red in fang and claw-but the clearest message here concerns the constancy of change.|Fresh
It's heady sci-fi horror, with plenty of analogies to ponder, and some truly gorgeous imagery.|Fresh
Despite The Shimmer, this movie certainly doesn't shine.|Rotten
It's a mind-bending film, and one that also plays with warping the medium as well, especially during its final act.|Fresh
It's a must-see for anyone who loves the truly speculative side of science fiction.|Fresh
This is a film that is both disturbing and provocative, leaving viewers to draw their own conclusions.|Fresh
When Lena ventures into that hole in the floor of the lighthouse, the worlds she opens up are truly astounding. We might even say they're worth the trip.|Fresh
This is one of those films that will require six or so viewings before it starts to make sense.|Fresh
I'm not exactly sure what to make of this movie but I can't seem to shake it.|Fresh
...boldly marches into formidable territory, where it might be out of its depth.|Fresh
It is scary, thrilling, fascinating and beautiful - all at the same time.|Fresh
'Annihilation' is an art-house science-fiction story.|Fresh
The kind of film that made me stand around outside the theater as it closed for thirty minutes with my friends talking about it.|Fresh
Annihilation is a thing of immense beauty and intoxicating complexity.|Fresh
Annihilation is a remarkable achievement. It lingers, burned into your thoughts, branded on the brain. It is nothing short of a masterpiece, and the fact that it exists at all is something worth celebrating.|Fresh
...an inscrutable sci-fi excursion that is filled with tension and outstanding special effects and production design without making a bit of sense...like going to a whodunit and when the movie ends not having a clue whodunit.|Rotten
"It's always grand to hear Crosby, Stills and Nash in any movie, and their ""Helplessly Hoping"" here brings a meaningful and calming beauty to it all."|Fresh
A metaphoric mind-bender that will find favor with select moviegoers while absolutely alienating everyone else.|Fresh
Portman is painfully restrained in the lead role, looking upon biological impossibilities and mutilated corpses with the same distant curiosity.|Rotten
A challenging, rich science fiction film that rewards patient audiences, although many will find the film tough to follow.|Fresh
This movie, unlike something produced for mass audiences, is about what happens in the calm moments between the loud, splashy sequences.|Fresh
Annihilation is a demented science-fiction comic book of a movie that makes less sense than a butterfly mating with a buffalo.|Rotten
Very much about trust within a marriage between equals as outside forces of alienation weigh on them. It's two pictures, but best big and loud, strange and now.|Fresh
Alex Garland's second directorial outing after the excellent Ex Machina, this brainy, metaphysical sci-fi is even more ambitious and more amazing. But its challenging conclusion could be a hard sell.|Fresh
Annihilation titillates the eyes of adrenaline junkies while also appealing to the flawed hearts of lovers.|Fresh
When it comes to real comic inspiration, it never passes Go and does not collect $200.|Rotten
This is a world one wants to crawl inside and live in for hours, maybe even days, at a time, the dangers of doing so almost secondary to the naturalistic discoveries and environmental truths that could potentially be revealed.|Fresh
Garland's Annihilation is disturbing. Not the whole way through, maybe, but there's at least one scene that qualifies as high-octane nightmare fuel...Annihilation is well-made and absorbing, and yet still not quite its own thing in the end.|Fresh
A wild and bizarre singular vision from Garland ... and exhilarating if you're here for it. Confounding if you're not.|Fresh
Annihilation is the kind of film that will endure the test of time, even as it no doubt fades away quickly at the multiplex, and confirms Alex Garland as one of the most exciting new filmmakers working today.|Fresh
Garland has a gift for locating the horror inside that silliness, and this is what gives the film such a kicky, off-center quality. You laugh at it and gasp at it simultaneously.|Fresh
The result is a film that has the feel of brainy, high-end science fiction, but ultimately neither the underlying structure nor content. It's a shame, given that we are in the midst of a modest heyday for the subgenre.|Rotten
Annihilation feels wholly unexpected and raw. It is a disturbing film for reasons that are almost metaphysical.|Fresh
Annihilation maintains a persistent sense of tension that keeps things compelling and will leave you wondering if you need to see it again (or just go read the source material) to make sure you understood what you just saw.|Fresh
Basic elements shatter and recombine in ways that, like the movie, startle and intrigue without ultimately cohering.|Fresh
On a purely visual, and visceral, level, Annihilation is haunting and memorable.|Fresh
Garland would have done well sticking with either fantasy or sci-fi, but half-assed both.|Rotten
Heavy on atmosphere, light on content. Derivative sci fi murk and chronological mush.|Rotten
Annihilation is a portentous movie, and a cerebral one. It's gorgeous and immersive, but distancing. It's exciting more in its sheer ambition and its distinctiveness than in its actual action.|Fresh
The problem with Annihilation isn't that it's too heady; it's that it's not heady enough.|Rotten
While brilliant at times it feels like a hodgepodge collection of scenes and elements from past sci-fi films that starts off promisingly but loses steam as it unfolds. (Full Content Review for Parents also available - Violence, Profanity, Sex, etc.)|Fresh
Annihilation is the best kind of cinematic experience, one that floods the senses without battering them into submission, and one that moves the mind and heart without manipulating them. It's a staggering thing to witness.|Fresh
Writer-director Alex Garland continues his assault on human specialness (and humanity in general), this time going so far as to loop in the self among the parts of us subject to genetic malleability.|Fresh
Portman smoothly conveys both delicate intellect and physical strength, a tough combination to pull off, while Jason Leigh is terrifyingly serene. Rodriguez, in stark contrast to her Jane the Virgin roots, was born to play an action heroine.|Fresh
The movie plays like a dream, at times verging upon a nightmare as layers of the unknown peel back to reveal something both completely alien and horrifyingly familiar.|Fresh
Alex Garland has now made two of the finest science fiction films of the 2010s, and cements himself as one of the most exciting filmmakers in the genre.|Fresh
Everything a modern science fiction film should be ...|Fresh
In this recent wave of sci-fi films, it's one of the best.|Fresh
"""Annihilation"" may not leave you satisfied, but if you're not afraid to get a little weird, it's a movie you won't forget."|Fresh
There's a lot of Tarkovsky in Annihilation, too much to be screened on the local multiplex. And that's just one of the virtues of Garland's fascinating sci-fi/horror hybrid. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's one scene that is so hair-raisingly horrific, it's still creeping me out days after I saw the movie.|Fresh
Annihilation is a riveting mix of the fantastically beautiful with the horrific and terrifying.|Fresh
Consistently tantalizing but also deliberately obscure...You might come out of 'Annihilation' wondering about what you just saw, but the sense of wonderment will stay with you.|Fresh
If Garland must play by some of modern Hollywood's rules, he abandons them in just about every other way.|Fresh
A beautiful, riveting sci-fi mystery that annihilates any notion of what a big-budget studio thriller can be.|Fresh
"""Annihilation"" really isn't worth seeing. Still, if you meet someone who has seen it, have them tell you the good parts."|Rotten
Can a flower be scary? Yes, a flower can be scary.|Fresh
Garland's creeping pace lulls you on an almost molecular level; he's made something akin to an end-of-the-world film, but one in which the changes afoot might not be wholly bad, title be damned.|Fresh
Garland uses luscious, even seductive visuals in the verdant Florida swamp setting to beguile and horrify us, sometimes both at once.|Fresh
Bold, metaphysical and just plain weird|Fresh
An intoxicating and unnerving sci-fi offering, one whose images tease and stimulate, more than confuse and create distance.|Fresh
Alex Garland's Annihilation is a bracing blend of cerebral sci-fi and grindhouse terror, a genre movie that's more, maybe too much for some viewers.|Fresh
Astonishing work is at play here, and it is refreshing to see five women spearheading the story.|Fresh
Annihilation is a movie that's impossible to shake.|Fresh
Moviegoers attracted to this film's sci-fi/horror billing should be warned: It's not particularly scary, the characters aren't deeply developed and the plot is at best uninspired.|Rotten
But I spent more time in the theater debating whether I wanted to know more or less about Area X than being invested in what happens to the protagonist. In both the Earthlings and the aliens, there's just too much blankness.|Rotten
A '50s-shlock, forbidden-planet monster movie in the key of Solaris.|Fresh
If one goes to the movies to have one's mind blown open by the new and the challenging, this is something to see.|Fresh
Writer-director Alex Garland has made an atom bomb of a movie, fiery and all-consuming and quite unnatural. It fills every inch of our heads with its beautiful terrors.|Fresh
Annihilation is high-minded science fiction where only those who actively enjoy thinking about and dissecting multiple themes need apply|Fresh
Annihilation also is about how we react to change itself. That leaves no easy answers.|Fresh
Without a baseline assumption of canned male toughness and bravado, the characters in Annihilation are freer to have more a more interesting dynamic-their steeliness and sorrow, their fear and flintiness, intriguingly commingle and inform one another.|Fresh
It succeeds in making the audience experience that same level of mystery and confusion that those on screen are experiencing.|Fresh
Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson especially stand out, and though they get a decent amount of screentime, I wanted even more.|Fresh
"""Annihilation"" holds you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."|Fresh
The result is daringly original and frequently beautiful, a shimmering treat from a singular intelligence.|Fresh
Here is a film that wholly embraces the concepts of the unknown and the uncertain.|Fresh
Gorgeous, unnerving, and utterly brilliant, Annihilation will scare the crap out of you just as much as it will make you think.|Fresh
"Garland has a David Cronenberg-like flair for metastasized biology, unnatural mutations, and human nature in extremis. But in ""Annihilation"" he doesn't seem to have figured out what any of it means."|Rotten
It's storytelling that feels like a stalking.|Fresh
"Ambitious and messy, ""Annhilation"" will likely leave you with more questions than answers. Mine is: ""When can I see it again?"""|Fresh
Equal parts spectacle and mindf*ck, Annihilation embraces visual storytelling and non-literal storytelling in a lean, sci-fi classic.|Fresh
Annihilation is about four-fifths of a tremendous science-fiction movie: it starts well, creates a compelling alternate reality, builds a fascinating narrative and then just sort of walks into a wall.|Fresh
Annihilation asks some big, essential questions, and the biggest thrill comes from watching a film astute enough to know it doesn't have all the answers, leaving its audience to emerge changed by the experience, but not yet knowing quite how.|Fresh
I can say without hesitation that Annihilation is one of my favorite sci-fi/horror movies of the past decade. A mix of cerebral science and visceral horror.|Fresh
"Like virtually every science fiction before it, once ""Annihilation"" - which deviates greatly from the book in its third act - starts solving its enigmas, the spell begins to break. But Garland's film is seldom not something to behold."|Fresh
From the reprocessed story to the uninspired visual palette, Garland's Annihilation never fails to disappoint.|Rotten
"Despite the beautiful aesthetics and the gloomy, visionary ambitions, ""Annihilation"" feels empty inside"|Fresh
While providing food for its ravenous creatures, it also provides food for thought.|Fresh
"The visuals are gorgeous. The mood is unsettling from start to finish. ""Annihilation"" is a strong sophomore effort from a very talented filmmaker."|Fresh
In this movie's attempt to be a modern art thinking pieces, the cohesive film element got left behind.|Rotten
It's something different that I haven't seen a lot of.|Fresh
The visuals in this film--it will kick your face in it's so gorgeous.|Fresh
Several months from now, you'll still be thinking about that unsettling closing image. Wow.|Fresh
As far as great science fiction cinema goes, Garland's latest ranks up there as one of the most ambitious and audacious offerings we've seen grace the big screen in the last few years.|Fresh
Even with all the CGI toys in the world, [Garland] commits to asking big questions without spoon-feeding the answers.|Fresh
A science-fiction flick that's at once intellectually ambitious and extremely frightening.|Fresh
Mr. Garland has a talent for unnerving you with quietly dissonant notes and an occasional grotesque flourish.|Fresh
Intelligent sci-fi done right.|Fresh
"Mesmerizing and thoroughly unshakeable. In spite of its title, ""Annihilation"" isn't just about the end of things, but also about the beginning of something else—an insinuation of profound and portentous consequence."|Fresh
Annihilation is a slow crawl creep show with jolts good enough to send your popcorn airborne.|Fresh
Annihilation is a visceral cinematic experience that, while plagued with structural problems, delivers plenty of thrills and eye-popping spectacle.|Fresh
The film is a masterful journey into strange new territory that is equal parts beautiful, frightening, mysterious and wholly captivating.|Fresh
Broken down to the basics, Garland has delivered another movie that's worth seeing. Like the Olympics, though, even when you put together a beautiful routine, points get deducted when you slip on the landing.|Fresh
The kaleidoscopic Annihilation is bound to dazzle and frustrate, spark debate and dismissal.|Fresh
The film is a death knell for fans of the books looking for a tenth of what they love about them reflected on the screen but, I even think, thin as the adaptation's mysteries are, the bulk of neophytes will equally find themselves bored or confused.|Rotten
The director of EX MACHINA returns, delivering a thrilling, gorgeous bit of big studio pulp filmmaking.|Fresh
