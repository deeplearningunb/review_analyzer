Even more magical is the film's soundtrack, which features original lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda.|Fresh
There are genuine laughs and emotions to be felt here, and even though the runtime is longer than many animated Disney films, it flies by. That must mean we were having fun...|Fresh
Moana is full of charm, a gorgeous-looking film that is full of life with some engaging leads and a snappy soundtrack.|Fresh
I really enjoyed Dwayne Johnson's performance in this film. Not only did he showcase some vocal skills for us in a few songs but his character was funny...|Fresh
Moana's heart is clearly in the right place, but it doesn't appear to have anything to offer beneath the surface - and certainly nothing to keep older viewers as entertained as younger ones on repeat viewings.|Rotten
A different breed of classical animated film. She's a Disney princess...with some updates and some much-needed tweaks.|Fresh
I wasn't blown away by Moana, but I liked it a lot.|Fresh
Moana is a thoroughly enjoyable animated adventure that earns a strong place in the Disney pantheon, but it doesn't quite rise to the lofty ranks it clearly aspires to reach.|Fresh
When a formula has worked for so long and laid the foundation of a media empire that spans the globe, there's little reason to deviate too much and Moana proves that the formula still works wonders.|Fresh
Moana is more like the ocean that plays a supporting role in the film itself; it's true nature can be found underneath the surface.|Fresh

What mattered most to me, however, was the lyrical nature of the story's beats, and how sensitively Moana's journey towards self-affirmation was sketched.|Fresh
The look, performances, and music make for a full film experience.|Fresh
With toe-tapping tunes and brilliant styles of animation to help tell a story of a strong heroine and her epic journey of self-identity.|Fresh
Make a quick escape to the islands with those you love, and your warm and fuzzy holiday spirit will be ignited.|Fresh
Moana keeps the very best of the tradition that has made Disney the leader in animated fairy and folk tales, and yet, it has a terrific modern touch.|Fresh
I'm just saying that Dwight Johnson's performance was solid. Solid as a rock....[Auli'i Cravalho] is perfect as Moana.|Fresh
It's good that Disney is branching out beyond the Western European princess model. But the story around those characters can't be just a generic amalgamation of native lore with a couple of catchy tunes.|Rotten
Disney has given us a wonderful Thanksgiving present, to be savored by all. I'll take seconds (and maybe thirds), please!|Fresh
I can't wait to see Moana again; I will say Moana is awesome-tacular!|Fresh
I didn't think it possible, but in terms of looks, Moana finds a comfortable middle ground between traditional animation and 3D CGI animation . . . with a story that features Disney's strongest female hero to date.|Fresh
Essentially, Moana has something for everyone while successfully toying with the tried-and-true Disney princess formula|Fresh
One of the Mouse House's most sumptuous looking films from an animation standpoint.|Fresh
Moana is the 56th animated film to be released by Walt Disney Animation Studios and it continues the studio's reign of animated hits as it enters Disney lore.|Fresh
Moana literally means 'the ocean' and as the heroine conquers her namesake, she also conquers your heart. You won't regret setting sail and voyaging with her.|Fresh
The animated musical-action-adventure will leave you feeling encouraged and empowered. It's joyous and flawless - fitting, as our heroine embodies the same qualities.|Fresh
After a sluggish start, things do improve but there are obvious structural echoes of Frozen and the incidental comedy is clumsy. Good but not great.|Fresh
Moana will be remembered more for its music than anything else, which is saying something because the movie itself is damn good.|Fresh
Bursting with color, music, beautiful seagoing vistas, and the mythology and folkways of the Pacific Islands, Moana is guaranteed to cure your winter blahs.|Fresh
Through beautifully rendered computer animation, Moana tells the upbeat, inspiring story of clever, brave heroine, Moana.|Fresh
Clearly, Moana's message is more important now than ever before.|Fresh
When the credits rolled, I had a smile on my face. Moana is simply enjoyable, up there among some of the best Disney movies thus far, in my opinion - and definitely one of the most progressive.|Fresh
The film's qualities go beyond mere positive, escapist fun. Moana's emphatically non-traditional, non-whitewashed take on Disney's princess films make it one of the most important movies of 2016.|Fresh
Moana flat-out wowed me, from its music, to its story and characters, to its sheer visual spectacle.|Fresh
Amazing film. Not as good as Lilo and Stitch, but then again nothing is. The Rock needs to do way more musical theater.|Fresh
Disney's latest princess-y adventure gets off to a slow start, but the story picks up when Johnson's rascally demigod comes on board.|Fresh
By giving us a heroine that acts the way heroes always have, perhaps Disney has finally given us a 'princess' movie that can cross that mythical gender divide.|Fresh
There is a lot about Moana that is extremely familiar to those who know the Disney formula, but it is tweaked with enough consistency and humor to make the trip worthwhile.|Fresh
Where Frozen was a defiantly chilly breath of fresh air, Moana feels somewhat stagnant. Despite a few fantastic deviations (including the lack of a love interest to hinder our hero's development), Moana is still very much a paint-by-numbers narrative.|Fresh
Normally when reviewing a movie, you come up with a healthy mix of positive and negative things to say about it. In the case of Disney's Moana, though, I'm really struggling to come up with the latter. It's just that wonderful.|Fresh
My nearly five-year-old granddaughter found parts of it too scary, but it's a rousing tale of an ancient island people, their gods and monsters.|Fresh
Disney's best animated film in a generation arrives on Blu-ray as one of the finest home-video releases of the year so far.|Fresh
"""Moana"" brings us a non-traditional Disney Princess that's unique, long overdue and feels right at home."|Fresh
Visually, Moana is a gorgeous film.|Fresh
The story is an echo of that ever-so-familiar journey in which young heroines become restless with the grind of their routines and wander beyond the borders of their world, usually against the wishes of strict parental figures.|Fresh
A film with a plot is as simple as effective that recovers the tradition of the studio with the contribution of new technologies. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

It's strangely addictive.|Fresh
Purposefully and persuasively continues the Disney tradition of tough, outspoken, and intrepid heroines without skipping a beat.|Fresh
Brimming with gorgeous visuals, enchanting tunes and a captivating narrative, Moana chronicles the life-changing story of the eponymous South Pacific Islander.|Fresh
A song score that's far weaker than the great animated musicals of the 1990s, this Disney princess film has all the charm one would expect from the Mouse House, without the feeling of urgency.|Fresh
Who knew the Rock could belt out giddy showstoppers like an old Broadway ham?|Fresh
I'd highly recommend taking the whole family to see Moana this weekend. It's exactly the kind of Disney movie we should be encouraging.|Fresh
Moana ticks all the boxes required to make a great modern Disney princess movie and does so without ever feeling like it's a Disney princess movie.|Fresh
Although the film lacks a swoony love story, its Freudian implications aren't particularly feminist, as Moana works to elevate the demigod's ego, diminished by the unreliablility of his damaged magical fishhook...|Fresh
As for Moana, she makes for an inspiring centrepiece, the latest in a long line of Disney heroines that is simply unmatched by any other studio.|Fresh
'Moana' is an enjoyable island getaway.|Fresh
It's a visual marvel and has the reliably nice message one would hope for from the Mouse.|Fresh
I highly recommend Moana to virtually any audience.|Fresh
This will naturally prove a summery fave for the small-fry, even if the songs don't quite hit the heights and the final act feels a little flat.|Fresh
Apart from those occasional dull patches, it is enjoyable.|Fresh
Make[s] a familiar narrative feel like much more, and an entertaining feature ooze with thoughtful delight.|Fresh
...one of Disney's least entertaining efforts in years...|Rotten
Perhaps the most encouraging part of Moana's feminism is its subtlety. It presents female agency as nothing out of the ordinary - it doesn't comment on it, there is no patriarchy she's fighting back against and there's no love story.|Fresh
Moana is a toe-tapping, heart-stealing adventure packed with laughs and featuring a kick-ass princess with nary a love interest on the horizon.|Fresh
A gentle, sun-soaked mythological Disney romp around the volcanic islands of Polynesia.|Fresh
Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) could be the most fully developed royal Disney heroine yet.|Fresh

Moana is a gorgeous offering by Disney that uses the magnificence of our planet to tell a simple but effective girl meets demigod sea-set story.|Fresh
A film that is far from being a disaster but at this point in the game, one expects something more from the Disney. And this time it didn't manage to meet expectations. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Here's hoping Moana opens the floodgates for more adventures with both girls and boys at the helm|Fresh
Well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.|Fresh
Though not without a few flat spots, this intelligently scripted and accessible fare is blessed with spellbinding marine visuals and esoteric earworms aplenty from composer-of-the-moment Lin-Manuel Miranda.|Fresh
What works best about Moana are its moments of cultural peculiarity.|Fresh
While Moana is the title character, it's Dwayne Johnson's Maui who steals the show - because he can.|Fresh
Though Moana delivers plucky entertainment and some colorful characters, it plays the narrative too safely by relying on commonplace machinations.|Rotten
Moana is one of Disney's best films, and undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and emotional of the year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that reformulated the classic mythology of Disney princesses in stories of emancipation and female self-assertion. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The literal and metaphorical journey is predictable but fun, funny and beautiful. It's got a lovely score and a great tone, ye parents of wee daughters might finally be able to let Frozen go.|Fresh
Dwayne Johnson does a wonderful job of voicing the conceited Maui, and if the storyline is not entirely satisfying, I could watch those gently undulating animated oceans forever.|Fresh
It's no masterpiece, but it's all extremely pleasant, and in Moana herself, the film boasts Disney's most interesting and complex protagonist in several years.|Fresh
In the next election, can I just vote Disney?|Fresh
A gloriously exuberant and colourful adventure set in Polynesia which is both pleasingly traditional (there are songs and a plucky heroine!) and wittily modern (no handsome prince required).|Fresh
There is much to relish in this animated Disney film, but I appreciated it as much for what it lacks as for what it contains.|Fresh
Directors Ron Clements and John Musker here segue seamlessly into their first CG feature, embracing the malleable magic of digital animation while retaining the clear lines that underpinned their previous work.|Fresh
It's a treat, for family audiences and musical theater geeks alike.|Fresh
Mines proto-Polynesian Oceania culture's carefully researched legends, myths and traditions to joyfully bring us a feisty new Hollywood teenage rebel princess.|Fresh
"Both brilliant and breathtaking, ""Moana"" is sure to be the next Disney classic. The characters are beautifully established and the actors behind them are pitch perfect."|Fresh
We never doubt for a second that Moana and Maui will complete their mission, but at least the story and animation have some lovely surprises in store along the way, especially in the spectacular climactic encounter.|Fresh
This is a very solid Disney feature, that looks good in 3D, featuring excellent voice talents. The songs are O.K., but not up there with the Disney classics. This is a good, but not great Disney animated feature.|Fresh
When you have a riveting action sequence that seems straight out of Mad Max: Fury Road as well as a tribute to deceased music legend David Bowie, the stage is set for a Disney film that will be out of the ordinary.|Fresh
In Disney's latest refreshing take on the princess genre, Moana is a feisty, sea-voyaging chieftain's daughter without any pink satin in sight.|Fresh
Visually stunning but narratively basic, Disney's Moana is nevertheless a highly enjoyable family movie that doesn't suffer too much from adhering to formula.|Fresh
Moana offers something for every viewer, regardless of age. Adventure, humor, music and, of course, messages about identity, maturity, generational transition or the environment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Disney's new animated gem and a reminder that possibly the company is currently going through the best years of its history. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Moana is a terrific Disney movie; vibrant, joyful, with great music and enthusiastic performances. It is steeped in tradition, both of its many legendary predecessors and the colourful culture it celebrates.|Fresh
A nautical yarn that leaves lesser children's fare all at sea.|Fresh
Truly wonderful stuff. If you don't enjoy this, I'd check your pulse as your heart must be missing.|Fresh
With a captivating heroine, a startling array of gods and monsters, as well as a simply storming set of tunes, this brings together the best of Disney past and present in one knockout entertainment.|Fresh
Moana offers first-class entertainment in the best Disney style.|Fresh
It's a two-character show, and the stars deliver the goods with irresistible charm.|Fresh
An amiable new animated musical that speaks to the tween-princess-sleepover demographic while tapping into Polynesian myths and making a modest, decently intentioned gesture at diversity.|Fresh
Moana lacks the zest we associate with Disney's greatest creations.|Fresh
No matter who wrote the songs, there was always going to be a line about listening to your 'inner voice' - it's pretty much Disney company policy.|Rotten
There could be umpteen charges of kitsch, political incorrectness and mongrelised cultural history. Yet this South Seas hurricane of a film blows us away, scattering our faculties and effects and substituting its own.|Fresh
Despite Dwayne Johnson's solid scene-stealing, the wave-taming Moana gets a true hero's journey in this South Seas stunner.|Fresh
Ultimately, it's this blend of character and quest -- infused throughout with an overriding warmth -- that makes Moana impossible to resist.|Fresh
Although it lacks a little humor, this film has a young Polynesian who's courageously seeking her place in the world instead of a prince charming, . [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The story is familiar, but the impressive animation and music should ensure that even the most jaded of viewers goes home with smiles on their faces.|Fresh
Don't be surprised if you're singing -- badly -- all the way home.|Fresh
Moana's animation and soundtrack are masterful, the best that the studio have done in two decades. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Moana"" sails straight and true, effortlessly, and with a great deal of joy and delight. It's perhaps not as clever or funny as this year's earlier Disney offering, ""Zootopia,"" but it's wonderful in its own island way."|Fresh
What impresses most here is the way the filmmakers combine the traditional Disney elements -- the sentimentality, the slapstick and the iridescent animation -- with a storyline rooted in South Sea island myth and culture.|Fresh
We can now agree that Johnson is not only the Sexiest Man Alive but also our strongest, lifting Moana on his character's beefy shoulders, carrying it like other hits before. No movie left behind.|Fresh
She's no official princess, but the girl can hold a tiara to Disney's legacy any day.|Fresh
Even if it isn't exactly unique, that doesn't make the movie any less rapturously entertaining|Fresh
If you don't walk out of Moana feeling a little better about the world in general, check your pulse. You might be dead inside.|Fresh
Maui isn't the only visual delight in Moana, but he's easily the standout. The lush 3-D depictions of the South Pacific actually make wearing the glasses and shelling out a few extra bucks worthwhile.|Fresh
Frozen it ain't. Still, Moana looks fantastic.|Fresh
Disney's digitally animated Moana, a Polynesian folk musical starring a plucky princess and a thousand-year-old demi-god, is beautiful to behold.|Fresh
Moana functions as well as it does because the story team ultimately focused on finding everything about Disney stories that worked in 2016, and improving everything that didn't.|Fresh
Moana may not be perfect, but you'll be humming its tunes and dreaming about its images long after leaving the theater.|Fresh
Moana's female-empowerment message may not be as thoroughly worked out as it is in a movie like Whale Rider, but it is an enjoyable family film for the holidays that showcases the work of many actors of Polynesian descent.|Fresh
When it's cooking, Moana prepares tender, slip-off-the-bone meat on the tried-and-true bones of the Disney formula.|Fresh
Singular in its imaginative, exotic visuals, which beg to be seen big and in the dark without distraction.|Fresh
Amazing adventure, colour explosions and catchy songs. This is amazing.|Fresh
With a gripping story fashioned from indigenous culture and a satisfying blend of the familiar and the knowing, Moana represents yet another triumph in the studio's impressive recent run.|Fresh
A touch too familiar to qualify as a modern classic, Moana is a relentlessly entertaining spectacle rooted in authenticity with a talent pool so deep you can swim in it.|Fresh
A film that while relevant and very modern, abides affectionately by the tropes of the genre at hand, depicting Polynesian culture with an air of enchantment and respect.|Fresh
Brimming over with spectacle and visual inventiveness.|Fresh
Moana isn't an instant classic on the level of Frozen, but it does continue Disney's strong multi-year run, thanks to great characters, gorgeous animation and a pretty strong story arc (Splice Today)|Fresh
Gorgeously animated, heartwarming, exciting, and slyly self-aware.|Fresh
Better than Finding Dory but not quite reaching the level of Zootopia, the latest Disney animated effort of 2016 adheres pretty much to the formula we've come to expect in recent years from the storied studio.|Fresh
Moana is her own heroine, and that's such a strong show of empowerment for girls of all ages.|Fresh
"There is much to love about ""Moana"" --- the wonderful music, lush animation and, most of all, the stirring story."|Fresh
Another traditional Disney animated flick packed with wonderful effects and Broadway-worthy music. Perfect for kids, adults and -- best of all -- families.|Fresh
... a crowd-pleaser that's worthwhile for more than just boosting holiday toy sales.|Fresh
"In the tradition of ""Brave,"" only significantly more watchable, this titled, strong-willed princess of a Pacific island doesn't need no stinkin' love interest to float her boat."|Fresh
The computer animation is nothing short of amazing to behold. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Stuff, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
A great deal of imagination has clearly been pumped into the movie, ensuring that it's continually enjoyable to watch.|Fresh
The Rock sings. A neglected culture gets its overdue closeup. Animation so lush you want to jump into the screen. Are you not entertained?|Fresh
2016 has turned out to be quite a good year for animation, and Moana is a worthy addition to the honor roll.|Fresh
It's a thrilling adventure that surges with sensational songs, lovable heroes, and messages that promote responsibility, forgiveness, bravery and resilience.|Fresh
Doesn't fire entirely smoothly - its convoluted plot is a little hard to follow, for instance.|Fresh
Moana is a funny, heartfelt and richly-crafted hero's journey adventure that effectively puts a Disney spin on Southern Pacific culture|Fresh
Moana recovers the spirit of Disney's unforgettable classic films and has a magical aspect thanks to modern technology. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of the animation world's cinematic highlights for 2016.|Fresh
As an animated film, Moana isn't close to ranking among Disney's best. But as a tropical postcard on the big screen, the animation couldn't be more spectacular and inviting.|Rotten
Crowd-pleasing and upbeat, an ideal movie for families to see together over the holiday weekend.|Fresh
a Disney cartoon doesn't need to be innovative to succeed; it just needs to hit the audience's heart and funny bone. 'Moana' does that well enough.|Fresh
Moana is a movie of natural delights.|Fresh
It would be going too far to say that Moana combines everything I enjoy about contemporary Disney with everything I dislike, but it's got quite a bit of both.|Rotten
The animation is so flawless that the sailing sequences look as though they were filmed on location. The realistic motion of the water, as well as Moana's and Maui's long, wavy hair, is especially impressive.|Fresh
"The highly hummable score, by a team that includes Lin-Manuel Miranda, includes a big song for Moana, ""How Far I'll Go,"" that should finally allow you to let go of Frozen's ""Let It Go."""|Fresh
A wonderful journey through the tales of a locale both inviting and intoxicating.|Fresh
Moana's likable, dynamic characters pair well with the bright, blue seas in 3-D.|Fresh
Cravalho has the charm and chops to stay in the lead role even when Johnson starts wielding his considerable charisma, and her Moana is the kind of smart and tenacious heroine who can inspire girls and boys alike.|Fresh
"""Moana"" might be [Walt Disney Animation Studio's] best since 1994's ""The Lion King."""|Fresh
Lovable characters, memorable music make Disney film great.|Fresh
There's not a prince or potential husband in sight; Moana's future is entirely defined by her leadership and ability to fend off the mansplaining know-it-all Maui. As messages go, we'll take it.|Fresh
This Disney princess has no prince and the film is all the better because of it.|Fresh
Moana is proof of one of the slightly less-repeated axioms of storytelling: It's OK to use familiar tropes as long as you use them well.|Fresh
[Moana] has supercharged wit, eye-popping visuals featuring azure seas and glowing coral, spirited voice work from Auli'i Cravalho as Moana and Dwayne Johnson.|Fresh
"Say aloha to ""Moana."""|Fresh
Perhaps the freshest pleasure lies in the spectacle of a Disney heroine who, for once, isn't beholden to any outside forces in pursuing her dreams.|Fresh
Disney adds another best-of-2016 with Moana, the latest 'princess' film that addresses issues of identity and environment with grace, intelligence, and enthusiasm.|Fresh
A progressive and rousing tale that becomes the crown jewel of the latest renaissance from the company.|Fresh
"If movies are meant to be a getaway, ""Moana"" is like a vacation."|Fresh
What the story lacks in boldness ... is compensated in design and animation. Water, hair and gravity all flow naturally. The sunny island environment radiates happiness. And it does feature some clever moments of slapstick comedy.|Fresh
"If I was maybe thinking that the Disney ""princess"" formula needed to be retired, ""Moana"" suggests another direction."|Fresh
There are no princes hanging around, no boys to really think about, no girly hang-ups or thingamabobs to fritter over, and no romantic subplots to distract from what's truly important: survival, independence, identity, self-belief.|Fresh
A winning combination of action, comedy, musical, adventure and drama. The best family film of the holiday season!|Fresh
Moana is a winning force, confidently standing alongside Ariel, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Anna.|Fresh
Adults probably won't even mind if this becomes one of those high-rotation titles once the DVD/download option arrives. It is, like its title character, smart, quick-witted, inventive and melodious.|Fresh
Disney should be applauded for adding more diversity to their Princess court. Those good intentions can only mask a few errors and can't bandage the clunky script.|Fresh
Moana will be a big, happy hit, and I'll forever want to live in its glorious and vibrant environs. But hard as she may paddle, Moana can't quite get past the cluttered reef of merch and other branded interests that keeps her film penned in.|Fresh
While Moana's story is rooted in the past, she's a modern heroine, a smart, resourceful leader who learns to find her own way.|Fresh
"""Moana"" is a welcome step forward in its message and its look, and for young women characters in this type of film. It's a way without many satisfying twists and turns, but forward nevertheless."|Fresh
Think of it as Disney's equivalent to Cars: an entertaining but average film that doesn't measure up to its predecessors.|Fresh
Paying respect and homage to the Polynesian culture and its ancient mythology, the Walt Disney animation Moana is as culturally rich as it is entertaining.|Fresh
Moana is a princess, but she's also tough and resilient, a hero worth singing about.|Fresh
It's a playful, self-aware delight from beginning to end, a cinematic Broadway musical from John Musker and Ron Clements, who perfected the form in The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Hercules.|Fresh
A contemporary musical adventure that defies a few antiquated Disney conventions while exploiting a few others that still work.|Fresh
A sunny, gorgeous emotionally heartfelt treat for a world desperately in need of a little comfort|Fresh
Moana is pure vintage Disney. Evoking the fiber of the studio's classic films, Moana is more than worthy of being included and forming part of the pantheon of official Disney princesses. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Moana is solid ""retro Disney"" - a new film that embraces older ideas, themes, and narrative approaches."|Fresh
You succumb to an enjoyable experience that splits the difference between mythology and merchandising.|Fresh
...will fit nicely between your DVDs of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid.|Fresh
"""Moana"" is a completely enchanting boost of warmth to the heart."|Fresh
Whether or not Moana is the movie we need right now I can't say definitively, but I think it was the movie I needed. And I suspect I won't be alone in that feeling.|Fresh
For holiday family entertainment, it does not get better than a fantastically lush Disney musical.|Fresh
Disney continues its animation roll with Moana, a seafaring quest that sails past its one rocky patch with visual brilliance and several Broadway-ready songs, the latter conjured in part by Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda.|Fresh
Moana is smart, funny, thoughtful and full of heart - everything you'd hope to find in a chief, or a movie about one.|Fresh
Moana looks lovely, and it gives us a princess we really haven't seen before. Those elements are surrounded, though, by too much that's all-too-familiar.|Rotten
"While the main themes of ""Moana"" are identity and self-discovery - familiar territory, to be sure - the film manages to enliven such well-traveled latitudes with a breeze as fresh as the islands."|Fresh
The film is bright, busy, enjoyable, progressive without being insufferable.|Fresh
"The film is richer for its attention to heritage, going far beyond surface aesthetics, building the foundation of ""Moana"" on the values and beliefs that make up this culture."|Fresh
It's a traditional kind of Disney movie, a crowd pleaser with a few earworms on its soundtrack and an endearing pair of mismatched leads on an impeccably animated adventure.|Fresh
It's so transporting it will have your kids begging you to book the next flight to the islands.|Fresh
"This is the best animated film I have seen since ""WALL-E"" (2008) and one of the best movies of the year."|Fresh
Moana pays homage to Pacific Islanders by introducing us to a strong female character unlike any we've seen in mainstream films - a hero who is both smart and sympathetic, strong and compassionate, independent yet belongs to a group.|Fresh
Moana would have been enormously entertaining regardless of when it came out, but its arrival at this particular moment in history gives it an added sense of significance-as well as inspiration.|Fresh
"a movie that follows the Disney playbook, for sure, but does it so well, even winking at it, that it is transcendentally delightful from start to finish...the best Disney animation to come down the pike since 2011's undervalued ""Winnie the Pooh."""|Fresh
Compared to your average Disney princesses, Moana is neither selfishly rebellious nor simplistically innocent.|Fresh
Tweaks the Disney animated template but sticks to its essentials, and does so nicely-it might not be revolutionary, but it's exuberantly familiar.|Fresh
A wonderful mythology of demons and demigods. A heroine who embodies the bold spirit of her people. Another sweet, funny, exciting triumph from Disney.|Fresh
That is Moana in a nutshell (or at least in a sea conch): smart about what it does, and easy on the eye, but at base the very Disney princess movie that it half-heartedly resists being - until, at least, its full heart is restored.|Fresh
"A dependably entertaining, visually dazzling riff on Polynesian folklore from the animators behind ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin."""|Fresh
"A lively adventure driven by an independent heroine and the Broadway-ready songs of ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. Gorgeous animation, too."|Fresh
Cravalho shows spunk and a generically lovely voice, though she's saddled with assembly-line anthems Disney has done better elsewhere. Johnson has exuberance, deft timing and a passable singing voice.|Fresh
"Walt Disney Animation Studios, which arguably hasn't had a dud since ""Meet the Robinsons"" in 2007, continues its roll."|Fresh
[A] lovely, reassuring hug of a movie ...|Fresh
Moana has the power to uplift, inspire, and entertain.|Fresh
Moana 's great heart and great humor actively subvert the violent, egocentric, macho mind-set that dominates so many popular stories.|Fresh
[Moana] is an excellent character with spirit, doubts, drive and a heck of a voice. She is a perfect addition to the roster of modern Disney heroines and one whom young girls will admire for years to come, princess or not.|Fresh
Moana is a joy.|Fresh
Temuera Morrison and Nicole Scherzinger are terrific voicing Moana's loving parents. Dwayne Johnson shines as Maui. First and foremost, though, is Auli'i Cravalho, winning the day and carrying the movie as the wonderful and quite lovable Moana.|Fresh
A wonderful tale of the South Pacific, 'Moana' delivers oceans of family fun.|Fresh
Enlightened and empowering, introducing a new Disney heroine.|Fresh
In addition to the music, animation and storyline, Cravalho and Johnson are wonderful together.|Fresh
If its heroine, despite her spunkiness, is a little milquetoasty, at least she doesn't pine for a guy-though how dumb is it that in 2016 we still have to compliment a kids' movie for that?|Fresh
Released two weeks after you-know-what, it comes off as a battle cry, preaching hope when we need it most.|Fresh
A call to adventure for a new generation.|Fresh
Amusing characters and the most advanced CG to come down the pike, should make Moana a winner at the box office.|Fresh
Disney's winning streak continues with Moana, a warm, friendly adventure destined for blockbuster success.|Fresh
A wonderful and culturally-inspired fairy tale that captivates and thrills while shining the spotlight on a mythos rarely explored by Hollywood.|Fresh
