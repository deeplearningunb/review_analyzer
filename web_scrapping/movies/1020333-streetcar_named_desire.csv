Vivien Leigh gives one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke pity and terror.|Fresh
...if the hothouse style was ever justified, this is the occasion.|Fresh
...Kazan achieves a sort of theatrical intensity in which the sweaty realism sometimes clashes awkwardly with the stylisation that heightens the dialogue into a kind of poetry.|Fresh
Inner torments are seldom projected with such sensitivity and clarity on the screen.|Fresh
The camera has done greater justice to the Williams play, catching the nuances and reflected tragedy with an intimacy that is so vital in a story of this type.|Fresh
Despite the overwhelming power of Brando's performance, Streetcar is one of the great ensemble pieces in the movies.|Fresh
Also screened was A Streetcar Named Desire, revamped with the four additional minutes that were excised years ago by censors. It was being paraded about as if a half-hour had been added. So now Stella walks down the steps sultrily.|Fresh
The fact it was the fifth most lucrative film in its year of release is a depressing sign of how we have infantilized ourselves as spectators. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
Seeing the film reminds us instantly of our perennial desire to be swept up into a compelling story.|Fresh
Tennessee Williams filled the tinderbox. Marlon Brando ignited it.|Fresh
"... a Hollywood landmark, both for pushing the envelope of subject matter allowed on screen by the censors and for showcasing the more naturalistic ""method"" approach to performance ..."|Fresh
An unqualified masterpiece.|Fresh
|Fresh
Epic performances in a movie that seethes with atmosphere.|Fresh
Starring Brando and Vivien Leigh, Kazan's screen version of Williams' masterpiece is the best film made out of the playwright's theaterical work.|Fresh
"""Stella!"" classic is powerful tale of abuse, alcoholism."|Fresh
Has a permanent place amongst the classics, not only for the performances but for Tennessee Williams' raw writing about people raw with pain, fear, longing and complicated feelings|Fresh
The blistering sexual repression is the entire point of the 1950s. Quite simply, fabulous.|Fresh
The film is perhaps best regarded as an intelligent and engaged recreation of the original Broadway experience, in which Jessica Tandy first played the role. There's no denying the awful horror and pity of the final scene.|Fresh
it's a close-to-definitive example of how to make a great play work on film, for all the very slight air of Hollywood compromise.|Fresh
Simply a masterful adap of Tennessee Williams' sultry, searing play and an affirmation of Marlon Brando's acting genius.|Fresh
There's an inevitable staginess to Tennessee Williams' devastating portrait of delusion and cruelty, but director Elia Kazan catches the squalid, claustrophobic atmosphere of a New Orleans tenement just right.|Rotten

Tennessee Williams's classic play provided Leigh with her second most famous role (after Scarlett O'Hara, natch), and serves as a reminder of the young Brando's brilliance and dynamism.|Fresh
A Streetcar Named Desire features some of the finest ensemble acting ever offered on the screen, speaking some Williams's most vivid dialogue.|Fresh
The classic adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play, featuring one of Marlon Brando's legendary performances.|Fresh
That melancholy we feel as it closes is a mourning for me that I'll never be able to see this film again for the first time--and that I'll never be able to appreciate any film that came before it without the stain of it in my perception.|Fresh
Brando pulls off astonishing things as Stanley Kowalski, and Vivien Leigh gives a performance that must have taken everything she had as Blanche DuBois.|Fresh

Brando's performance is probably the most influential in movie history for the way its raw naturalism smolders amid the stiff theatricality that surrounds him.|Fresh
Ironically, of the four lead actors in the movie, it was only Brando who did not win an Oscar. Go figure. (Blu-ray Book edition)|Fresh
Brando is all mumbling naturalism and animal magnetism; Leigh is all preening, affected, theatrical mannerisms. The differences make a startling contrast.|Fresh
This is a film about passion, and the movie positively oozes it.|Fresh
With The Glass Menagerie, one of the best Tennesee Williams film adaptations.|Fresh

Lacks the poignancy you could almost swear was a given, considering it was adapted from an acclaimed Tennesse Williams play.|Fresh

This faithful picturization of Tennessee Williams' grim and depressing drama of Southern decadence will shock many regular picturegoers just as it will be widely praised and discussed by sophisticated patrons.|Fresh
Over a dozen Tennessee Williams' plays have been translated on celluloid 41 times to date, yet none match this production.|Fresh
Brando's performance as Stanley is one of those rare screen legends that are all they're cracked up to be.|Fresh
A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) is a subversive, steamy film classic that was adapted from Tennessee Williams' 1947 Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name.|Fresh
The powerful performances remain untarnished by time.|Fresh
Thanks to the excellent text and superb actors, Kazan managed to create a very good film, but he still failed to turn it into genuine and everlasting masterpiece.|Fresh
A wonderful screen drama.|Fresh
