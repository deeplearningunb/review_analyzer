Paterson is quiet, low-key, meditative and deeply moving.|Fresh
Seeing the everyday through the perspective of a creative mind helps transform a low key character study into something more akin to magical realism; the end result is nothing short of utterly joyous.|Fresh
It's almost a thesis on the pleasures of simplicity, quietude, detachment and a form of solipsism.|Fresh
Paterson is cinema as a slice of life.|Fresh
I think Jarmusch really nailed the life of a creator who can observe the minutiae around them and transmute it into gemlike verse, and yet still remain curtained off from public attention.|Fresh
"The filmmaker's choices and the film's subject's choices are so carefully weighted and so perfectly chosen that the universe of ""Paterson"" is one of deep and lasting meaning, and the character of Paterson is unforgettable as portrayed by Adam Driver."|Fresh
While nothing really happens, such is the strength of the performances, and the sweet, lowdown vibe Jarmusch creates, Paterson makes for delightful company.|Fresh
These seemingly small moments contain a certain magic all their own, internal rhymes and themes that begin to dismantle the idea of normalcy.|Fresh
The movie is a visual and narrative masterpiece. The landscape conveys the character of the town, its history, and the inner life of its inhabitants.|Fresh
It's a saccharine film, sometimes relieved during Paterson's walks through town on the way to the bar he visits every night while walking his cute dog.|Rotten

"The film is a celebration of ""everyday poetry,"" and those who take the time to find it."|Fresh

Paterson is a beautiful film, quiet and quietly devastating in a way that won't leave you alone for a while.|Fresh
What's compelling about Paterson is the tension-call it dialectical-between Jarmusch's highly stylized elegy for a once-vibrant industrial city in New Jersey and his self-conscious homage to a poetic sensibility.|Fresh

Driver gives a beautiful, understated performance, one which proves how powerful stillness can be as an acting choice.|Fresh
Serenity prevails in Jim Jarmusch's tale of a New Jersey bus driver with a penchant for poetry, a loving girlfriend with a zany taste in design, and a dog with an Oedipus complex.|Fresh
How do I love writer and director Jim Jarmusch's latest and possibly greatest film, Paterson? Let me count the ways.|Fresh
Paterson is sweet and sui generis, full of surprises and visual winks that repeat themselves as inner rhymes. The portrait of an endearing artist. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Jarmusch celebrates small-town life and the dreamers who live in them, while choosing visuals that mirror the patterns of poetry.|Fresh
This offbeat project is actually very engaging, bringing droll humour and sweet-hearted feeling to its low-key affirmation of ordinary life.|Fresh
Delivered with humour and pathos, this is a literary film in more ways than one. ... Those who find pleasure in the written word will discover much to enjoy here.|Fresh
This is Jim Jarmusch in the mode of the unassuming poet of everyday American dreamers, taking in the rhythms of life in the blue collar city and celebrating the artistic impulses and creative projects that bring color to our lives...|Fresh
It's 2016 and we're still supposed to be impressed with watching a white guy move through life with quiet, alarmingly minimal, disappointments? No, thank you.|Rotten
A film where the director impregnates each scene with a romantic stillness and a tendency to a static camera. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
If your preference is movies filled with action and conflict, it's going to be annoyingly inert. But in a certain way, watching Paterson's daily life *is* exciting.|Fresh
Jarmusch's droll stroll, reworking his signature-style -- cross-cultural encounters, bohemian souls, deadpan humour, the eye of an urban fl√¢neur -- makes Paterson his own two-hour, small-scale poem.|Fresh
The result is a film that is so funny and wise and thoughtful that yeah, I guess you could call it poetic.|Fresh
Scenes unfold like small poems in Jim Jarmusch's Paterson.|Fresh
Lensed with a painter's eye by the great Frederick Elmes, the movie conveys an aura of Blakean mysticism through such homely sources as an 8-by-10 mugshot of Lou Costello...|Fresh
Subtly stoic, it's a melancholy meditation.|Fresh
(Paterson) sees poetry everywhere, just by watching the world. Jarmusch invites us to do the same.|Fresh
This is a rare, gentle movie. I don't think we'll see the likes of it again anytime soon.|Fresh
A movie shaped by the style and structure of a poem. If it is also an echo, I urge you to be its shadow, and dance with it.|Fresh
Jarmusch shows us something seldom captured on film: the act of creativity, as a spark of an idea is nurtured and revised, through brain power and hard work, into something beautiful.|Fresh
[Driver lifts] a very good drama into the heavens with an indispensably rich, textured performance, one that reconfigures all notions of what the actor is capable of.|Fresh
Deceptively simple and emotionally elegant|Fresh
There is a calm to Paterson that we can all embrace.|Fresh
Paterson is a likable but very minor film about what is, for some, a major subject.|Fresh
Jim Jarmusch: His hair is a national treasure. And Paterson is the finest film in the indie writer-director's (he does the music too-and doesn't even take credit!) distinguished career.|Fresh
[Paterson is] full of regard for the little things that warm its people's lives, and real respect for the ways they attempt to reach beyond their limitations, through creativity and humour.|Fresh
The end result is Jarmusch's best (and most personal, seemingly) film to come around in quite some time...|Fresh
Paterson is a quietly majestic paean to the life of the mind; to the perishability of everything.|Fresh
Paterson left me with a feeling of hope.|Fresh
"Paterson's life sounds like it would be pretty dull to live through, let alone watch in a movie. But in writer-director Jim Jarmusch's hands, ""Paterson"" becomes a fascinating and enthralling film that finds magic in the mundane."|Fresh
Paterson's bus is non-articulated, but he's as articulate as they come. ... Think Taxi Driver reimagined by Fred Rogers.|Fresh
The different Patersons combine into a terrific take on love's abiding worth, the mechanics of creativity and the strength of community. The film has Jarmusch's trademark deadpan deliberation, but it's also possessed of a great and genuine heart.|Fresh
Even those who have resisted Jarmusch's idiosyncratic style in the past may find themselves drawn to this charmingly offbeat ode to the lift that a touch of poetry can bring to an ostensibly mundane existence.|Fresh
'Paterson' is a leisurely stroll through the lives of two creative individuals who support and love each other, and understand and embrace the other's foibles.|Fresh
Jim Jarmusch's Paterson is infused with the poetry of the quotidian, and defying the odds against this type of endeavor, Paterson is also one of the maverick filmmaker's most accessible films.|Fresh
It's a pleasure to watch, so much so that I've viewed the film several times since receiving a screener copy in December. Paterson is different, distinct, and satisfying, one of the best films of 2016.|Fresh
Driver cleverly doles out pieces of Paterson's being in such slow, steady increments that you're surprised by how deeply you've come to love this incredibly average guy.|Fresh
Jarmusch takes us for a week in the life of his bus driver/poet (Driver), a working man with a kooky wife (Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani), a spiteful dog, and pals and acquaintances that help make this film an easy, often charming watch.|Fresh
Paterson is an exemplar... plumbing the passion for meter and the banality of the everyday while tapping into the rhythm and flow of the human condition.|Fresh
For the second year in a row, my favorite film is a winning love story named for an urban area more or less in my backyard.|Fresh
Adam Driver is the reason to see this special film from Jim Jarmusch.|Fresh
As a portrait of a relationship of would-be famous artists-he who follows a strict routine and she who changes her artistic pursuit on a whim-Jarmusch does not take a stance that one is better, just that simply doing is the best.|Fresh
Paterson is a lovely film about a man of simple wants and needs...|Fresh
I'd rank Paterson among [Jarmusch's] very best films. It's a treasure, and the best American film of 2016.|Fresh

...about dreamers, opposites and the deep happiness found in an optimistic view of life.|Fresh
If it sounds like not much happens in this film, well, have you ever seen a Jim Jarmusch movie?|Fresh
"I think Jarmusch has actually remade ""Groundhog Day"" as a work of spiritual ecstasy. I also think Paterson the man may be a Zen Ralph Kramden."|Fresh
An aged hipster's take on what a young working class poet might be like...static. Humorless.|Rotten
Paterson is a keen observer of the meaning the mundane. As is Jarmusch's poetic film.|Fresh
Or would you rather be a fish?|Fresh
The story takes place over the space of one week. Minor triumphs and tragedies that seem exaggerated in importance amid the sameness. There is also some drama in the story because of the crazy things that love does to a person's mind.|Fresh
Jarmusch was always funny, but there's warmth now, too.|Fresh
Jarmusch's setting, in its heightened sense of the mundane, reminds us unmistakably of the filmmaker's vision of Cleveland, Ohio, in his 1984 breakthrough Stranger Than Paradise.|Fresh
Patient, watchful and quietly transcendent.|Fresh
A certain type of viewer (particularly white dudes with literary aspirations) will want to jump right into the film and live there...|Fresh
Driver's performance as an uncertain man getting through the day-to-day prosaic, quietly buoyed by passion and artistic commitment, is exquisite.|Fresh
Paterson is easily one of Jarmusch's most accomplished films. He portrays the life of the mind and the workings of the creative soul as a kind of secret love affair, a deep, hidden well inside the most ordinary, mundane existence.|Fresh
It's a perfect vehicle for Driver, who endearingly captures the hangdog humility of his character.|Fresh
Driver is turning out to be one of the finest actors of the moment, an understated star with a great, non-movie-star face.|Fresh
In Jim Jarmusch's new movie Paterson, there's no major action day to day, but magic is constantly bleeding in from around the edges.|Fresh

One of those rare, assured films that isn't particularly remarkable yet is enjoyable and charming in all the ways that matter most.|Fresh
Like good poetry it moves at its own speed and every detail, every syllable, has profound impact.|Fresh
Paterson is a procedural of the creative process. Paterson is also the best love story of the year, of two different varieties.|Fresh

In a world beset by divisions and distractions, so much depends on Paterson, who looks at the world with clear eyes and finds beauty in the ordinary.|Fresh

...exudes something that eludes so many of us: contentment.|Fresh
Jarmusch has created a small miracle of a film, one that is both intellectually dazzling and emotionally provocative.|Fresh
'Paterson' is a film extraordinary in its ordinariness, in its willingness to show us people like these, and to suggest that these will be their lives, and that there's nothing disappointing or shameful in that.|Fresh
The film's leisurely pacing, which might take a moment to adjust to, mirrors the bus driver's own unhurried rhythm, allowing the audience to experience the world from his very particular perspective.|Fresh

It's absolutely worth hunting down for any passionate cinephile.|Fresh
Here's a sweet and lovely film, from director Jim Jarmusch, featuring a pair of breakout performances and a lived-in sense of place for Paterson, NJ. (Splice Today)|Fresh
Still, Paterson's single week offers a persuasive manifesto for a contemplative, non-incident-based form of poetic cinema, and for the virtues of poetic sensibility.|Fresh
The film's stubbornness to entirely reveal its intentions and its perpetual love for poetry is both fascinating and bizarre.|Fresh
[Jarmusch] wants the audience to know that the world is poetry in motion, and we should save this dying art from extinction.|Fresh
"""Paterson"" is simultaneously a paean to art and a tribute to working men-long-suffering men who toil in thankless isolation on repetitive jobs, carrying family responsibilities on their shoulders."|Fresh

Here is an unexpected emotional powerhouse, a movie that defies the odds in serious ways, even with the imprimatur of writer-director Jim Jarmusch.|Fresh

Paterson, represents director Jim Jarmusch doing everything he does well to the best of his abilities.|Fresh
A feature-length exploration of the linkages between routine, unexceptional daily life and the creation of art, and the kind of personality it takes to transform one into the other.|Fresh
Adam Driver is disarmingly sincere as a simple man who finds a meaningful outlet through poetry--and it's the filmmaker's ability to find something pleasing, possibly beautiful, in the ordinary that makes the movie worthwhile|Fresh
It's a turn of minor gestures that lacks the obvious Best Actor grandstanding to, say, win an Oscar, but rest assured Driver's performance is one of the most impressive given this year.|Fresh
It's a distinct Jarmuschian effort, but I doubt few would want his work any other way.|Fresh
A tribute to the life and times of a bus driver, poet, and master of everyday spirituality.|Fresh
Paterson doesn't give answers, but it holds a lot of wisdom regardless. Jarmusch directs our attention through Paterson's and gives a glimpse of goodness that's in short supply, both onscreen and in the real world.|Fresh
Jim Jarmusch and Paterson: here is the most beautiful match in the world.|Fresh
The deliberately paced film rewards patience in its quiet observances of daily life and an almost poetic celebration of mundane details that shape our daily lives.|Fresh
A beautiful little paean to the trivialities and triumphs of everyday life.|Fresh
Adam Driver gives his loveliest, most lyrical performance in this Jim Jarmusch film-one of the year's best-that takes its good, sweet time working its way into your mind and heart. But when it does, you're a goner.|Fresh
This is a movie about forgiveness - forgiving other people for what they do to us, forgiving ourselves for not always measuring up to some ideal.|Fresh
Driver's Paterson doesn't blast his presence. Rather, he drifts into view, an unassuming shadow that only grows larger over the length of the film.|Fresh
With each step, the film gains depth. Small variations in routine start to feel monumental, and the briefest encounter can seem like a sign of something great.|Fresh
A meticulously composed movie, shot beautifully by Frederick Elmes; every frame is a beauty.|Fresh
Mr. Jarmusch creates that rarest portrait of the artist: the one who's happy being hard at work.|Fresh
"""Paterson,"" like most films assured enough to make their own rules, is not just a refreshing change of pace but a revivifying one."|Fresh
The movie is a charmer, as sweet as it is slow. But even some sympathetic viewers may find it nothing more than an almanac of neat stuff, less dramatized than merely cataloged.|Fresh
Jarmusch salutes a life with a refreshing lack of drama.|Fresh
This movie has almost no bite but plenty of moseying charm, and what it does get right is the idea of poets as perpetual magpies.|Fresh
I've never seen a film that captures the inner world of an artist with such delicacy.|Fresh
There's a hushed beauty to Paterson and Paterson that celebrates the way in which even the most ordinary, prosaic lives can be full of poetry.|Fresh

"""Paterson"" is decidedly not the tedious affair that was ""The Limits of Control""."|Fresh
The film is as innocent as it is gentle, and viewing it is a truly sublime experience.|Fresh
The film is about the act of creation and the art of observation, and it couldn't embody both more perfectly.|Fresh
It's a whimsical story packed with wry humour, thoughtful emotion and some spicy details in both the people and places.|Fresh
Paterson finds its true nirvana when it sits still and becomes Jarmuschian.|Fresh
"Paterson's a great character to have right now, and the movie about him - also called ""Paterson,"" and set in the New Jersey city of Paterson - is great to watch now, too."|Fresh
Visually creative drama with a sympathetic poet hero.|Fresh
Here, Jarmusch says of artists (just as he suggested of vampires in Only Lovers Left Alive): they walk among us.|Fresh
Driver's turn here is pure poetry.|Fresh
A quiet miracle of a film, and a kind of sublime minimalist poem in itself.|Fresh
A delightful, meandering meditation on finding art and beauty in the most ordinary of places.|Fresh
I feel a tad churlish in not loving Jim Jarmusch's gently lilting film.|Fresh
A revealing character study, a reminder to recognise the small stuff that comprises much of our existence, and an appreciation of the ups and downs of living, all in one.|Fresh
Jim Jarmusch's elegantly minimal and wryly comic study of Adam Driver's bus driver-poet celebrates and exemplifies a sturdy American vision of art as labor.|Fresh
Nothing world-shaking happens in the film, but every second of its characters' routines feels rich with meaning.|Fresh
"""Paterson"" is filled with moments and interactions that seem like they're headed toward drama but take a different route. And even though it's set in the present day, Paterson's quaint life evokes an earlier period, adding a thin layer of surrealism."|Fresh
Jarmusch, that aging ambassador of cool, sincerely respects both the the ordinariness and the artistry of his blue-collar hero. One does not contradict the other. They are intimately related.|Fresh
Keeping his distance from the granular details of psychic conflict, Jarmusch's domestic idyll veers distressingly close to some kind of working-class virtue fanfic.|Rotten
Driver, fast becoming a thespian force, gives a considered and mature performance as the taciturn Paterson.|Fresh
Jarmusch is justly revered as one of the fathers of modern independent American film, but his films have grown ever more wispy and self-congratulatory, Paterson, though artful in its way, is the most cloying of the lot.|Rotten
Jarmusch expresses in a beautiful, deep and consistent manner his way of understanding the cinematographic narrative capturing the dead times, the repetitions and the pauses in the life of its characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A minimalist masterpiece where Jim Jarmusch shows a more romantic, poetic and even Zen side, and teaches us to appreciate the little things. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Poetry, cup cakes and an English bulldog are some of the unlikely ingredients of the film, whose existential themes weave an indelible, rich tapestry|Fresh
The magnificent film's conceit is that ordinary folks are poets who might or might not know it.|Fresh
An amazing little film that makes of simplicity its emblema so we can fall in love with its protagonist and the rest of the characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Adam Driver's wonderful performance and his sweet rapport with his on-screen wife, played with delicate compassion by Golshifteh Farahani, along with a hilariously expressive bulldog, are enough to save the film from its more obnoxious idiosyncrasies.|Fresh
It glides along comfortably enough as a portrait of very ordinary lives somewhat lifted to the skies by both verse and cupcakes. Paterson isn't a bit patronising. It is just a rather sweet story.|Fresh
A melancholic movie about melancholic characters leading melancholic lives. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
Paterson quietly contemplates the creative process and the beauty of everyday things through the unlikely personage of a Star Wars villain. Who knew Driver could be so mesmerisingly motionless?|Fresh

What was charmingly loose-limbed in Jarmusch's earlier films now seems mannered and tired.|Rotten
Jim Jarmusch has created a truly poetic film about a promising poet.|Fresh
Driver, with his long, sloping brow and soulful lips, is both formidable and sympathetic, like an Easter Island statue that's a really good listener.|Fresh
It's a thrilling rumination on the mimetic aspects of poetry, the inexplicable drive towards creativity and the search for meaning in the most simple acts of human expression.|Fresh
For all its fine qualities, Paterson feels complacent and self-regarding. It's hard to listen to lectures in modesty from a film that's so busy admiring itself in the mirror.|Rotten
[Jarmusch's] best in a decade.|Fresh
True, some of Paterson's poems are just dull-dull. And the whimsy can be cloying. But the acting is fantastic.|Fresh
A perfectly constructed, beautifully acted and utterly charming indie drama that will make you see the world around you in a different way. It is, in a word, unmissable.|Fresh
Jarmusch is at his most refined here, as he carefully chronicles the humble exploits of one of life's observers.|Fresh
Paterson offers a modest, slow-burning fanfare for the common man.|Fresh
Slowly but surely, the gentleness of Jim Jarmusch's lovely new film steals up on you.|Fresh
A quietly utopian film, and a balm to watch.|Fresh
Jarmusch proves that it is possible to make a film in which the everyday can be turned into something mysterious and even transcendent. This a quiet film but ultimately a very rewarding one.|Fresh
Everything is structured to evoke poetry through its measured pacing. The space left between events and interactions shows Jarmusch at his most poised.|Fresh
Long-time fans won't be disappointed with Paterson; Jarmusch's trademark dry wit and attention to mood are all over it ... a beautifully modest movie and one of the best portraits of a working-class American you'll ever see. (Reviewer: Chris Neill)|Fresh
Paterson, for me, succeeds in creating a tone that is very much its own, and by practising exceptional levels of dramatic restraint, delivers a ponderous, thoughtful experience, much like the ones in its protagonist's head.|Fresh
A mesmeric treat of a film - one of Jarmusch's best.|Fresh
Quiet, thoughtful and deeply human, this is one of Jarmusch's finest and features Adam Driver's best performance yet - although you do risk coming out with a new affection for modernist poetry.|Fresh
Paterson is Jim Jarmusch's masterpiece.|Fresh
Paterson is a warm and uncynical in its celebration of small-town life and dreams.|Fresh
Paterson inhabits a wistful world in which language still has the power to cultivate art from the mundanity of everyday life.|Fresh
Jarmusch overturns worldly indifference to properly acknowledge life's grand insignificance, as well as the mind's immeasurable capacity to upend the immense ennui of the universe.|Fresh
Paterson's writing may never earn such notice, but his perceptions on everyday existence are a quiet delight.|Fresh
This is a sublime film about the democratic consolation of art, and of one another.|Fresh
Like many of Jarmusch's best films, this keeps surprising us with its minimal, witty inflections, at once epic and small-scale.|Fresh
[A] quietly seductive study of a guy named Paterson, a Paterson, New Jersey bus driver played by Adam Driver.|Fresh
One of the director's finest to date, the film derives its unique power from the repetition of daily life, elevating the mundane to a kind of divinity.|Fresh
Paterson, The Movie And The Melancholy Muse: The thwarted artist as whimsical working stiff in these economic hard times. And this typical economically depressed town, yet quirky and daffy, in the symbolically laden shadow of that bustling NYC metropolis.|Fresh
Adam Driver makes the perfect Jim Jarmusch proxy in Paterson, the indie filmmaker's most accessible work.|Fresh
Paterson is a movie so indebted to the necessity, futility, synthesis, isolation, validation, subversion, entertainment, and art of watching the world, that I feel reluctant to tell you anything but to give it a look.|Fresh
The film concerns the humbler creative expressions of everyday life, where one creates art not for notoriety or superiority, but for the simple pleasure of making it.|Fresh
It's a one-of-a-kind, strangely moving film, and as close as cinema gets to pure poetry.|Fresh
Jim Jarmusch's Paterson, led by Adam Driver's skillfully restrained performance, is a brazing social commentary culminating in a harsh, yet beautiful truth.|Fresh
A perfect little film that doesn't need to try too hard to win us over.|Fresh
I love this movie.|Fresh
Beneath this unassuming exterior is a beautiful tale of living a fulfilling existence.|Fresh
Jim Jarmusch makes vibrant films/ Out of quiet distinctions/ A taste for perfect, ordinary things.|Fresh
There's an austerity to [Paterson's] days and to his processes that Jarmusch sells very effectively. And so does Driver, with his off-kilter sincerity.|Fresh
What a pleasure... that Driver not only delivers-giving a quiet, soulful, kindhearted performance that's my favorite thing he's done thus far-but that Jarmusch's film is as wise, winning, and surprisingly moving as it is|Fresh
Paterson himself is deathly allergic to pretension, and the film inhabits his sensibility. It's A Portrait Of The Artist As A Working-Class Stiff, arguing for the mundane beauty of all our lives.|Fresh
A lovely fable about the fragile, fruitful and occasionally fraught relationship between creativity and everyday life.|Fresh
Jarmusch is not trying to convey a message, but merely cultivating poetry with a unique texture. And while the pace may feel as slow as the bus's commute through Paterson, it is nevertheless a sublime slice of life in the city of bards.|Fresh
Jim Jarmusch's latest film recalls some of his best work and, once again, the American indie maestro presents a unique and intricately crafted world.|Fresh
An ode to Paterson and to poetry itself.|Fresh
Paterson is a curiously charmin tale, dressed with some of the characteristic humor of it's author. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Paterson engages you from the start and leaves you with a smile. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film is constructed with delicate symetries that feel mechanical yet uniquely beautiful. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A serene and adult reflection in zen mode about the beauty of being and exist in the world, day by day, moment by moment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film's poetry comes from Jarmusch's creativity and sensibility that exist in every detail and observation, from de couples' innocent kindness and the way he recorded that working neighborhood. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film has incidents rather than plot: disruptions, minor mishaps, happy accidents. How Jarmusch takes this match-stick house of nothings and fills it with such calm and wisdom is a mystery with only one real answer: he's an artist.|Fresh
Paterson is, in short, a great lesson in life and film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
We can say that Patterson (the film) is a necessary and invigorating antidote (made of lightness and transparency) against all action movies, noise and heavy technological devices. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Its restrained aesthetic and Driver's sublime, understated performance render it the director's most recognizably human and poignant film.|Fresh
There's a quietly revelatory virtue to Jarmusch's film in its resistance to disturb its subject's life, to adhere to any typical conventions of film drama.|Fresh
The great wonder of Paterson is that it makes a compelling tale of an apparently blissful life.|Fresh
Pure poetry.|Fresh
A mild-mannered, almost startlingly undramatic work that offers discreet pleasures to longtime fans of the New York indie-scene veteran, who can always be counted on to go his own way.|Fresh
"In ""Paterson"" the appeal of the Jarmusch vision shrinks down - in every way - to something relatively minimal."|Rotten
Jim Jarmusch's sumptuous sonnet to poetry and ordinariness.|Fresh
