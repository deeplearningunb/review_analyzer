This is a terrific introduction to a fascinating life.|Fresh
The film succeeds in the more basic sense by surveying a complicated woman's existence. It also does so without diminishing the intimate details that help audiences relate to Lamarr's complexity not just as an icon, but as a human being.|Fresh
This documentary of actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr is engaging and poignant, expanding the view (and our understanding) of the famously beautiful Hollywood star.|Fresh
With a central thesis unable to fully grapple with her beauty and her intelligence, it ultimately fails to fully create a narrative of a woman who was more than her beauty, and more than brains-despite-her-beauty.|Rotten
A recently discovered set of 1990 interview tapes with this amazing woman fills out a detailed and revealing portrait.|Fresh
This film is packed with emotional kicks.|Fresh
The real tragedy against humanity uncovered by Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story is the millions of ideas that never came to light because society refused to listen to women.|Fresh
The movie star who inspired Snow White's face had bad luck in Hollywood, but she was a drop-dead beauty who saved countless lives.|Fresh
Alexandra Dean's documentary will fill you in on Lamarr's remarkable, if troubled, life.|Fresh
A timely and emotional documentary on the former 40s and 50s Hollywood star Hedy Lamarr.|Fresh

Director Alexandra Dean's Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story doesn't shortchange Lamarr's career but also focuses on other aspects of Lamarr's fascinating, often tumultuous life.|Fresh
A crazy story that is well told in Alexandra Dean's film.|Fresh
It's a touching and fascinating tale.|Fresh
Dean explores a fascinating life full of contradictions.|Fresh
Bombshell suffers from some common complaints of modern documentary -- too much music; unnecessary, if perfectly decent, animated sequences -- but it does remind us of a class of personality that doesn't exist anymore.|Fresh
This moment of women rising up and taking control of their own empowerment is the perfect time to release a documentary about Hedy Lamarr.|Fresh
This dichotomy - between the emptiness of glamour and the great power of intellect - is what propels Alexandra Dean's debut documentary.|Fresh
She lived an amazing life, tasting all the rewards and pitfalls of fame. But this is a woman who never had the chance to show her full potential.|Fresh
Lamarr was an enigma: a great brain trapped in a silly, spurious image of glamour, while her real talent was allowed to wither. A sad but fascinating story.|Fresh
If her story, however, is even vaguely familiar (made nude flick, was brainy, did inventions, made glamour flicks, stayed brainy, had lots of plastic surgery, died) then this will be a very ho-hum trawl.|Rotten
"It's Lamarr who sums up her own apparent contradictions best: ""I'm just a simple complicated woman."""|Fresh
[It] bids a unique perspective on a complex individual.|Fresh
When you're the best at having an aesthetically pleasing face, it can make it all the more difficult to be taken seriously in other departments.|Fresh
This sympathetic, enthralling film is a tribute to her talent and courage, the gifts behind the alluring impact of her unforgettable face.|Fresh
It's a proper story alright, and a fascinating one.|Fresh
It is no hagiography: even Lamarr's own children are open about her flaws. But Dean treats her subject with respect as a great mind; something rarely afforded to Lamarr by her male contemporaries in life.|Fresh
As marshalled by director Alexandra Dean, Bombshell is the revelatory memoir Lamarr never published.|Fresh
A vivid portrait of one of the most remarkable, pioneering women of Hollywood's Golden Age.|Fresh
It is quite a yarn.|Fresh
"It may be the best ""not just a pretty face"" story in the history of the world."|Fresh
What a bombshell.|Fresh
A life story packed with incident means that this sometimes rushes past events that would be formative for anyone else, but equally means that Lamarr's life story is never, ever dull.|Fresh
Smart, if indulgent.|Fresh
Intriguing and inspiring, she is something of a feminist hero; not just because of her incredible life story, but also her refreshing, determined and decidedly modern outlook.|Fresh
It confirms her prowess as an inventor of much more than male fantasy.|Fresh
[Alexandra] Dean doesn't break new ground in terms of the documentary format but she proves to be a dogged researcher who uncovers some great archived material about Lamarr.|Fresh
Film buffs must-see doc about Lamarr's invention of device to steer torpedoes remotely using frequency hopping technology. Genius. Another Hidden Figures.|Fresh
As a CliffsNotes of what Lamarr's life in Hollywood and contributions to society have been, it's not a bad jumping off point.|Fresh
Bombshell is a decent, albeit uninspired introduction to a unique figure who secretly succeeded at everything she attempted.|Rotten
It's tapes of an interview Forbes reporter Fleming Meeks conducted with her around 1990 that give the documentary a much needed jolt. We get to hear about her life in her own words.|Fresh
"""Bombshell"" would be a rather ordinary Hollywood bio if not for the fact that besides being a ravishing beauty, the Austrian-born actress Hedy Lamarr was also a scientific genius."|Fresh
"""Bombshell"" is sensational when focused on Lamarr's amazing achievements, offering sensitivity to a complicated life but also assigning heroism to an unlikely source, achieving its goal to position Hedy Lamarr in an all new light."|Fresh
There is plenty for the film buff to enjoy...There is poignant film of Lamarr in her later years when she became a recluse, and a cheering finish with the ceremony at which her discovery was finally acknowledged.|Fresh
...a great look into the bad and the beautiful of the old Hollywood studio system through her eyes.|Fresh
... director/writer [Alexandra] Dean describes Lamarr's contributions to cinema and science with equal emphasis on both, a rare acknowledgement of Hedy's imaginative, insightful analysis of technological challenges.|Fresh
Bombshell is a much-needed corrective to the historical record, updating Lamarr's biography so that we fully understand her contributions to our world past and present.|Fresh
It fascinates both as film history and as a sobering reminder of how little credit a woman like Lamarr received, even at the peak of her popularity.|Fresh
Bombshell becomes more somber as it progresses to Lamarr's post-fame life. Still, it's an essential re-examination of the fascinating woman obscured and cheapened by Hollywood mystique.|Fresh
I feel looking at Bombshell simply through the prism of how women were and are treated in Hollywood would be doing [director] Alexandra Dean a disservice.|Fresh
A documentary that follows Lamarr's tumultuous life, tracking a life in which her beauty served to obscure her brains, although her brains persevered.|Fresh
If the storytelling technique is a little prosaic, the subject matter is more than sufficiently engrossing.|Fresh
The film evokes sadness as we watch Hedy Lamarr, once considered the world's most beautiful woman, give up a chance to make big money on her major invention and withdraw from public life as she aged.|Fresh
"""Bombshell"" finally gives us the complete picture of this complex woman. It is as eye-opening as it is bittersweet."|Fresh
There are Hollywood biographies, then there are fascinating lives. One of the most beautiful - and arguably the smartest - actresses of all time could certainly claim the latter.|Fresh
"What makes ""Bombshell"" intriguing is not just Lamarr's gift for invention, it's also what a fiery individualist she was, someone who had no regrets about her eventful life (""You learn from everything""), not even its racy, tabloid elements."|Fresh
"If there were ever the personification of ""more than just a pretty face,"" it was [Hedy] Lamarr."|Fresh
Even for those familiar with its subject, the film is compelling and insightful.|Fresh
"With all due respect, so far as movies are concerned, the Jewish ""Wonder Woman"" of 2017 is not Gal Gadot but Hedwig Kiesler."|Fresh
An entertaining documentary, though its thesis isn't entirely convincing.|Fresh
Knowing how much else Lamarr had to offer, and how little the world cared about it, saddened and infuriated me.|Fresh
Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story celebrates the life of the actress-turned-inventor and helps to set the record straight.|Fresh
A well-paced if conventional mixture of archival clips, talking-head interviews with historians, biographers, children and friends.|Fresh
If Bombshell inspires people to seek out her movies, it will have achieved two goals: giving her the belated credit she deserves for a critical invention, and laying the groundwork to rebuild her reputation as an actress. Her beauty speaks for itself.|Fresh
An upbeat look at a starlet who was a lot more than just a pretty -- some say the prettiest ever -- face.|Fresh
Dean is fascinated by the highs and lows of this enigmatic woman's life.|Fresh
Ms. Dean relates Lamarr's ventures, those onscreen and off, with savvy and narrative snap, fluidly marshaling a mix of original interviews and archival material that includes film clips, home movies and other footage.|Fresh
It's good a woman - an innovation/technology journalist-turned director - is the one to finally put everything (rumor and truth) together via a wealth of informative archival material and newly conducted interviews.|Fresh
The infuriatingly tragic true story of the Hollywood superstar whose brain was ignored because she was beautiful. A stupendous tribute to a remarkable woman.|Fresh
Completely absorbing and well-researched documentary.|Fresh
"Recognition (and compensation) proved elusive in Lamarr's lifetime, but in this marvelous documentary, a brilliant woman - ""I'm a very simple, complicated person"" - finally gets her due."|Fresh
Too sympathetic toward its subject to serve as a satisfying biography of the actress-inventor, but it's a totally serviceable, if disappointingly uncinematic, film about a singular celebrity.|Fresh
Dean's movie is not a tract. It's a straightforwardly told, A-to-B-to-C chronicle of Lamarr's history, given richness by the many points of view offered by an impressive lineup of talking heads.|Fresh
The film curiously steers toward surmising Hedy Lamarr's psychological state as it pertained to love and pleasure.|Rotten
Dean resurrects Lamarr's whole person without false moments or awkward fawning. The honesty makes the tragedy of her story linger. She was damned by something she had no control over: The way she looked.|Fresh
Heard through lively 1990 interviews, Lamarr describes a career that objectified her and a brilliance that wasn't recognised, let alone rewarded, until late in her life|Fresh
It's a great story - and one told with real sympathy and respect for its enthralling subject.|Fresh
Bombshell becomes not just a stupendous tribute to Lamarr, but also a tribute to every brilliant woman ignored.|Fresh
A thoroughly engaging, eye-opening showbiz doc.|Fresh
