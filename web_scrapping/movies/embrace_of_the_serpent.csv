The time is our best card and our worst at the same time. Time is like the embrace of the serpent: it is warm but, at the same time, is really suffocating. Enjoy the marvellous hug. [Full review in Spansih]|Fresh
Form merges magically with content in this intuitively hypnotic and sensory treatise on colonialism in the deeps of the Amazon in the early decades of the 20th century.|Fresh
While difficult to identify a single factor that renders the film such a remarkable achievement, at the top of any list would certainly be the central performances by Nilbio Torres and Antonio Bolíva.|Fresh
The young director, Ciro Guerra, working from the diaries of two real-life explorers, lures you in with visuals so verdant and dense, in black and white widescreen, that you can almost overlook the moral simplicity.|Rotten
These are but reaching gestures from an artist who is willing yet unable to present to the world an original idea.|Rotten

It's both a challenging and engulfing movie-going experience -- a true journey on multiple levels. And it's definitely one that should be seen on the big screen.|Fresh
Mesmerising.|Fresh
Embrace of the Serpent is a mystical movie missile from Colombia. It's ballistic, balletic, sometimes brilliant.|Fresh

A film that honours the mysteries and majesty of a lost world.|Fresh
...a lament over lost culture.|Fresh

...a flawless masterpiece and essential viewing...|Fresh
The many awards and accolades (including an Oscar nomination as Best Foreign Language Film) together with positive reviews quoted on the marketing materials for this film lifted my expectations - perhaps too high|Rotten
Visually stunning, the raw beauty of the landscape is breathtaking, yet the narrative involving two scientists and their search 40 years apart fails to embrace as it should|Fresh
There's something deliciously off-kilter about folding a story about the abuse and genocide of indigenous South American cultures into what amounts to a mismatched buddy comedy.|Fresh
It's a beautiful, stirring, and thoughtful film, well worth seeing.|Fresh
Colombian director Ciro Guerra conjures the mesmeric tones of Conrad and Herzog in this time-jumping fable about a shaman guiding two white explorers in search of a rare plant, 31 years apart.|Fresh
Mercifully, Ciro Guerra's film is not another Heart of Darkness-style meditation on the so-called white man's burden.|Fresh
While Guerra clearly owes a debt to Herzog and Coppola, he blazes his own trail. I can't wait to take this trip again.|Fresh
Complex and thought-provoking.|Fresh
I was utterly mesmerised, captivated and transported.|Fresh

Every now and then, with great infrequency (alas), a film comes along that is like no other and completely knocks you for six, and that is Embrace of the Serpent.|Fresh
Embrace of the Serpent swells with unhappy images, but it is also fired by poetry and, in Karamakate, it has one of cinema's great stubborn heroes.|Fresh

A fascinating work, filled with unforgettable images and narrative daring.|Fresh

An essential difference between this and previous similar movies is that the central point of view is not that of a European or North American interloper but that of an occupant of the forest -- in this case, a feather-bedecked Amazonian shaman.|Fresh
Karamakate worries the world will forget how to see and hear. This lucid, original and unsettling cinematic dream offers a way to remember.|Fresh

For those who surrender to its atmosphere, and appreciate an unconventional cinematic experience, it's extraordinary.|Fresh

"""Embrace of the Serpent"" is film at its most ambitious and uncompromising."|Fresh
"Wholly original and brand new, director Ciro Guerra's ""Embrace of the Serpent"" immediately feels like some kind of lost classic, a movie that has been around for a long time but only talked about in film circles, finally unearthed."|Fresh

This movie is a two-hour trip you'll remember for years to come.|Fresh
Bewtween spiritual, etnographic, and andventure cinema, this is a film that stands out in latinamerican cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
More intriguing in its ambitions than in it successes, which are limited, and oddly keeps its distance from the very people it wants to enlighten us about.|Fresh
A beautiful meditation on memories and dreams, and an excoriating indictment on cultures lost.|Fresh
Not nearly as great as Herzog's films, or as monumentally deranged as Coppola's, it nevertheless casts a spell of its own. It's one of those films that, at least for me, grows in the memory.|Fresh
Embrace of the Serpent raises provocative questions about the depiction of native cultures onscreen and in Anthropological texts.|Fresh
"A new trip down an ancient river, with shades of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Aguirre: Wrath of God."" Mesmerizing and occasionally mind-altering."|Fresh

If Embrace of the Serpent's revelations are a bit familiar, its approach makes them feel otherwise.|Fresh
Embrace of the Serpent feels special because ... it recognizes that the two subjects are deeply intertwined, even as they sometimes appear at war.|Fresh
Colombia's first ever nominee for a best foreign-language Oscar is also unlike anything you've seen before.|Fresh
It's another in a long, honorable line of films that chart the poisonous effects of colonialism on indigenous populations and their ecosystems, but with an unusually invigorating perspective, like a reverse-angle Heart of Darkness.|Fresh
Though its themes of colonialist exploitation are potent in their own right, the major draw of Embrace of the Serpent is its setting...|Fresh
Guerra's reimagining of the lives of lost peoples is compelling, but, despite many languorous images of river and jungle, this remains a bookish examination of the themes.|Fresh
A well constructed story in form and content, swing between adventure and introspection. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A strikingly photographed black-and-white epic that intertwines a passionate attack on the depredations of invasive capitalism with a potent adventure story about not one but two trips down that river into a Conradian heart of darkness.|Fresh

Apocalypse wow.|Fresh
An evocative journey through a changing world in search of a culture that's disappearing before the travellers' eyes.|Fresh

The mysteries keep piling up through the final frames, when black-and-white film can't contain the story any longer and it bursts with unworldly color. You won't want to wake up.|Fresh
Embrace of the Serpent is the type of film we're always searching for, yet seems so obvious once we've found it.|Fresh
A cross-cultural masterpiece set in the Amazon.|Fresh
Ciro Guerra's excesses in arthouse symmetry tend to arrive in the service of a just and angry correctivism.|Fresh
