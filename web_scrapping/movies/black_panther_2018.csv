Chadwick Boseman is the star of the movie but he is fighting a losing battle against scene stealers such as Michael B Jordan, Letitia Wright and Sterling K. Brown.|Fresh

I loved spending a couple of hours in the Black Panther's magical, transformative world. Mark me down as someone who wants Wakanda to stay isolated.|Fresh
"Black Panther turns racial politics into what Malcolm X called ""politricks"" . . . The media's enthusiasm for this bland action flick is maddening. The problem isn't one particular movie, but the celebration of the illusion of ""progress."""|Rotten
What's the problem? Well, there's way too much expository dialogue and there are too many turgid flashbacks...the hand-to-hand fighting and battle sequences are now so formulaic and predictable in Marvel films that the adrenaline just doesn't kick in.|Rotten
Black Panther definitely warrants multiple viewings - one just for the visual roller-coaster ride, and sets itself apart from the rest of the MCU with a formidable blend of good story and magnificent design.|Fresh
As a formal showcase for the Black Panther, Coogler's film should keep diehard Marvel fans happy.|Fresh

Wildly enjoyable ...|Fresh
Most of the time Black Panther delivers a masterful new take on the superhero origin story, fresh in its perspective and energetic in its plotting. I highly recommend.|Fresh
Black Panther's important and timely, but more than that it's a hugely entertaining film.|Fresh
A powerful, new Marvel superhero arrives in an exciting, exhilarating, socially relevant, Afro-futurist origin story..|Fresh
Black Panther's failures, like its triumphs, are more Shakespearean than superheroic.|Fresh
In the end, Black Panther is basically a really satisfying thrill ride.|Fresh
It's uniquely satisfying popcorn entertainment, a triumphant trifecta of subject matter, talent and timing.|Fresh
...a solid and entertaining film that arrives at the right place at the right time. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Not since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises has a superhero film so openly expressed politics - not so much ideology but a cultural mood - and taken so many chances.|Fresh
Full of nobility and purpose without sacrificing fun and charm.... A slam-bang action adventure that also fills a need.|Fresh
It's impossible to picture anyone other than Boseman in the lead role - but by god - Michel B. Jordan certainly gives him a run for his money.|Fresh
It's an excellent, proud movie, and it has a lot to be proud of.|Fresh
While Black Panther is undeniably exciting overall, its opening sequences are more convoluted than most MCU films. But from there, there's a lot of compelling, exciting, crowd-pleasing action.|Fresh
Black Panther is an important movie that doesn't feel like being forced to eat kale, thanks to car chases, shootouts and subtle bursts of humor.|Fresh
I don't know -nor care- if this is Marvel's best, but it certainly is the most thoughtful and conscientious look that the studio has given to true life injustices. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Inhabits a nuanced moral universe with compelling villains and uses the fantastic to grapple with real ideas. I can't believe this is a Marvel movie.|Fresh
This is one helping of popular culture in which effects don't dominate every scene and characters have room to breathe. That's good news for Marvel and even better news for those in the audience.|Fresh
Black Panther gives the eponymous hero a whole epic to himself and the complicated story of his long-hidden homeland with some pseudo-Shakespearean power struggles.|Fresh
Hail Wakanda. Powerful symbolism and visuals, fabulous supporting cast, score produced by Kendrick Lamar. Film is also technical embarrassment of riches.|Fresh
As a writer/director, Coogler has firmly established that his strength is in creating and developing intimate relationships that capture the viewer's attention.|Fresh
Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira, who play Nakia and Okoye respectively, are particularly fierce, especially in their numerous fight scenes, a rarity for women in a superhero movie outside of Wonder Woman.|Fresh
Coogler has played with the age of dilemma of winning freedom through armed struggle versus gaining it through peaceful means. But Black Panther is no Gandhi, he's a superhero with enhanced abilities and a combat suit that James Bond would kill for.|Fresh
The continent that gave birth to humanity won't look the same on the big screen ever again thanks to the introduction of Wakanda, the fictional home of the most technologically advanced people on the planet.|Fresh
Coogler and his talented cast and team tell a story that dazzles, one that dares its audience to dream of a world unrestrained by our own stifling reality, without ignoring how the pain of the real world informs those joyful dreams.|Fresh
This film is a giant middle finger to all things authoritarian.|Fresh
Black Panther could have been just another Marvel romp-a fun but ultimately disposable entry in the studio's catalogue. But Ryan Coogler and company had the power, and perhaps the responsibility, to do much more. And they did.|Fresh
Classic comic-book stuff made fresh by drawing on underexplored mythologies and cultures, yet still deeply resonant and deeply universal. An exhilarating pulp-fiction dream that ups the ante on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.|Fresh
The wildly enjoyable 'Black Panther' claws its way to the top of the Marvel Universe.|Fresh
You can feel the sameness of Black Panther ... Watching the film, though, is to see something completely different in the realm of these stories.|Fresh
The film per se is correct, but it is not the masterpiece of action cinema that will mark paragons, nor set the bar higher... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...the free-est film in the MCU. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Black Panther is a superhero film that manages to achieve moments of cinematic clarity that all great films do. It is worth your time and it will spark your imagination.|Fresh
But the most revolutionary thing about Black Panther is its city. The capital of Wakanda has skyscrapers, a monorail, sidewalks of grass, green buildings, farmers markets, and no cars.|Fresh
One of the year's best films, and one that transcends the superhero genre to emerge as an epic of operatic proportions.|Fresh
"Believe the hype: ""Black Panther"" transcends its comic-book origins, achieving a mythic grandeur that's nothing short of exhilarating."|Fresh
It is a landmark moment in blockbuster cinema that couldn't be more timely or more confident in its ability to be so.|Fresh
[The] script adheres to the usual genre formula of tomfoolery, in-jokes, mythology and outright poppycock, but their knack for teasing emotional resonance out of standard scenarios gives them the edge over predecessors and competitors alike.|Fresh
Destined to be celebrated, and for good reason; this may not be the first film featuring a black superhero, but it is groundbreaking all the same for being the first of this scale.|Fresh
It's more than just an overdue step of onscreen representation. It's also a rollicking good blockbuster, even if it doesn't quite reinvent the wheel.|Fresh
"""Black Panther"" is so worth the hype."|Fresh
A beautiful, hallucinatory sequence, as Killmonger reaches peak villain and assumes his powers, is the most dramatically fraught and heart-wrenching moment in any Marvel movie.|Fresh
A fresh new Marvel superhero movie unlike any other.|Fresh
Black Panther is a pretty entertaining film and an important one, even though it stops short of being a great one.|Fresh
[Chadwick] Boseman carries that moral and emotional weight to reaffirm him as one of Marvel's finest casting choices|Fresh
Like T'Challa's step toward becoming a world leader, Black Panther shows the next generation of comic book films how it's done.|Fresh
The richness of the visual palette here is dazzling.|Fresh
Will play well across the board and thankfully features more depth than your typical superhero movie fare. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
This is serious superhero business. That gravity is the movie's strength and weakness.|Fresh
"Yes, this ""Black Panther"" is red-hot. Wakanda forever!"|Fresh
"Forget a lethal presidential Twitter account, King T'Challa has drank some kind of tea made from a Heart-Shaped Herb enabling him to take on an army. ""Black Panther"" pulls the right emotional levers focusing on the theme of the forgotten and the lost."|Fresh
Black Panther is a feast for the eyes, the ears, the heart and the mind, a film that has action, heart, substance, and soul.|Fresh
In the red, white and blue hue-niverse of superhero colors, black is the new beautiful.|Fresh
An insipid, soulless, and overproduced bore.|Rotten
Like the best blockbusters it's flawed but ridiculously entertaining anyway, and like too few of them it's also so incredibly important.|Fresh
Michael B. Jordan gives a hell of a performance. Maybe people will stop blaming him for FF and give him his due. Killmonger is one of the best characters Marvel has ever created. Stop using the Race card to promote this film.|Fresh
That's the sound of the game being changed and everyone is going to have to follow the King. This should signal a major change to the superhero film landscape for years.|Fresh
A wonderful sense of culture and costumed authority, creating a vibrant solo showcase for the world of Wakanda and all the political turbulence and fierceness it contains.|Fresh
The good definitely outweighs the problematic here, making for a superhero movie that's definitely one of the better examples of the genre though hardly as groundbreaking as some would claim.|Fresh
Black Panther is a great MCU superhero adventure that smoothly blends rich narrative substance with sheer popcorn entertainment.|Fresh
This is an origin story, globe-trotting spy thriller and fantasy, all in one. The movie manages to be part of, but something completely different than, the Marvel superhero movies that came before.|Fresh
Black Panther is, without a doubt, the coolest superhero movie to come prowling out of Marvel Studios.|Fresh
All hail Ryan Coogler, the Black Panther, the Dora Milaje, and everyone who helped to bring this next-level, majestic, and wildly entertaining superhero movie to life.|Fresh
What's honestly amazing about this film is that I'm not thinking about the action, the cool epic moments...I'm thinking about the things that shape these characters into who they become...I have to commend Black Panther, but it's not a film without flaws.|Fresh
Black Panther was fantastic. It has the fun superhero stuff, but that's not really what it's about...they bring you in on a fascinating, colorful, vibrant civilization.|Fresh
With a bloated 2 hour, 15 minute running time, Coogler ran out of ideas.|Rotten
... while Nyong'o and Wright get the most playfully lively opportunities to charm, it is the fiercely dedicated passion Gurira brings to her portrayal of the warrior Okoye that impressed me the most.|Fresh
If Wakanda, invisible to the naked eye yet brimming with futuristic technology that could better the entire planet, is a beautifully depicted metaphor for representation, then Killmonger is a manifestation of African-American pain past and present|Fresh
Black Panther proves how representation can rejuvenate even the oldest superhero origin arcs, allowing Marvel a victory that still feels every bit a Ryan Coogler film.|Fresh
There's talent in every corner of the film, and it elevates Black Panther beyond so many of its superhero contemporaries even as it exhibits some formulaic tendencies.|Fresh
A vibrant film that beautifully blends superhero action with a poignant, Shakespearean-in-scope story.|Fresh
All of these conflicts are eventually resolved in the conventional framework of a Marvel action movie... More unconventional are Coogler's ideas.|Fresh
It is a terrifically entertaining film, alive from the start, following its Marvel mission (for good and bad) while rising above it.|Fresh
"This is 2018's first great motion picture - a title that will surely be remembered when ""end of the year"" bests are discussed."|Fresh
Iron Man tries too hard and Captain America is far too earnest to be cool but Black Panther, both Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of the character and the film that surrounds him, is just effortlessly cool.|Fresh
In Black Panther, Coogler and company have made a superhero picture that's twice as good, twice as smart, twice as fun to look at as any before it. May they get twice the credit and twice the box office.|Fresh
That's some complex stuff for a superhero movie, and Coogler and co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole give it the emotional weight it deserves.|Fresh
The results are astonishing.|Fresh
Between Black Panther's Black Lives Matter subtext and its use of female characters as more than window dressing both in front of and behind the camera ... it seems as though Hollywood has, for one shining moment, caught up with the real world.|Fresh
Smart, accessible, and thoroughly fun, Black Panther is a new high for Marvel Studios.|Fresh
Black Panther is one of the best superhero movies of the century.|Fresh
"""Black Panther"" is the superhero movie - no, movie, no qualifier necessary - that we need, right here, right now."|Fresh
[Ryan] Coogler's overall ambition in crafting a sociologically complex story and presenting it as standard comic book movie fare succeeds: There is nothing common about Black Panther.|Fresh
"[Chadwick] Boseman is perfect as the Panther, just the right mixture of royal privilege and humility, in a story that allows for a sense of wonder rarely found in ""comic book movies."""|Fresh
To the infinite credit of Coogler and his team, Black Panther fights constantly and bitterly against the familiar constraints of Disney's superhero industrial complex.|Fresh
It's very, very good -- in its best scenes, exhilarating.|Fresh
"The bad guy is so brilliantly realized by Coogler's frequent collaborator Michael B. Jordan as Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens, a former Navy SEAL gone bad."|Fresh
It is modern, sharp and cool, honoring the past as well as the present, and pushing the boundaries of the genre past what audiences are used to from superhero movies.|Fresh
...a cinematically holistic work of diversity, in which cultural identity has been carefully woven into every element of the movie.|Fresh
Letitia Wright steals the thunder as T'Challa's younger sister and Wakanda's tech and weapons genius. I would love to see her and Tony Stark in the same room, just to watch them out-geeking each other.|Fresh
It's possible to love Black Panther but be conflicted, but still love it, but still be conflicted, all the while sharing in the unmitigated joy of its existence.|Fresh
Black is beautiful.|Fresh
Black Panther, a gleaming example of Afrofuturism, provides a unique perspective on a well-worn genre.|Fresh
These are no small ideas. This cogent screenplay serves up the obligatory superhero trappings -- but it addresses real-world issues of global propriety and responsibility with an underlying sense of gravity.|Fresh
Black Panther might be the first MCU film that could claim to most clearly be an expression of a particular director's voice.|Fresh
Boilerplate Marvel, with a sleek, colorful look, cheeky humor, and familiar action beats...But Coogler brings enough to the table for a fresh vision, broadly appealing as well as inspirational in its representation for black audiences and women.|Fresh
One of the best films from Marvel, thanks to it's richness in culture and mythology, and one of the best villains to date. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Black Panther is worthy, no question, but it's also a little dull.|Fresh
The plotting is predictable and the action sequences for the most part unengaging. Black Panther is a major disappointment.|Rotten
"May Marvel learn its lesson from ""Black Panther"": When a movie like this ends up feeling both personal and vital, you've done something right."|Fresh
Chadwick Boseman commands every moment of this film, radiating probity and purpose, and it's only later on that you realize that, with another actor, this wouldn't have been a sure thing.|Fresh
It's taken a decade and 18 films, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally produced a superhero movie that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a comic book.|Fresh
"Coogler is a young filmmaker - this is just his third feature, following ""Fruitvale Station"" and ""Creed"" (two fine and very different films) - but he marshals this world with confidence and flair."|Fresh
Like all the best comics movies, this one's got a villain (Michael B. Jordan) so compelling he nearly steals the show from the hero (Chadwick Boseman).|Fresh
Noble and worthwhile, but slow and frankly generic, save for the terrific African touches.|Fresh
Marvel Studios has yet again managed to blend together familiar elements into something that feels new with Black Panther.|Fresh
Marvel's Black Panther is a complete triumph and is simply one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe entries yet.|Fresh
Whilst a Marvel story through and through, fitting perfectly into the MCU post-Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther stands alone as a masterpiece of filmmaking.|Fresh
There's a whole lot going on in this latest Marvel chapter. And boy, are we all the better for it.|Fresh
...a song of freedom within the genre. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Coogler delivers action with frenetic grace, keeping the violence more intimate than usual for a superhero movie. Less soulless metropolis crumbling and more face-to-face combat (although the armored rhinos aren't bad).|Fresh
The true knockout stars are Lupita Nyong'o as Wakandan spy Nakia and Danai Gurira as Dora Milaje general Okoye.|Fresh
After this first trip to Wakanda, some will never want to visit that country again. Others, who already know their wonders, will want to visit it again ...but only in vignettes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Coogler builds a thrilling, exciting world, and threads throughout it a story filled with pathos and real-world gravitas.|Fresh
Black Panther comes to life with a real brio and glee...|Fresh
It was gripping, it was invigorating, the action was so cool!|Fresh
... a film that fulfills the most rote demands of superhero spectacle, yet does so with style and subtexts that feel bracingly, joyfully groundbreaking.|Fresh
Even if you are not a fan of superhero movies you may find the issues explored thought provoking. It is also action packed, well acted, dazzlingly shot by English cinematographer Rachel Morrison and... full of humour and self-aware wisecracks.|Fresh
This is a movie whose political theory matches its stunning special effects.|Fresh
A witty, action-packed epic, this adventure delivers a vibrant twist to the comic book movie formula while remaining true to the Marvel Universe it belongs to.|Fresh
Black Panther sees female characters finally given space to shine in a Marvel movie, and shining brightest of all is Letitia Wright.|Fresh
Coogler puts all the will-they-won't-they 'black Bond' speculation to rest by effectively getting there first, from the fascination with gadgetry to the thrilling set-pieces.|Fresh
Ryan Coogler has eschewed the familiar Marvel glut of smug in-jokes and mind-numbing CGI explosions to create a visually dazzling work of art.|Fresh
It's the kind of art that's aggressively theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel performative.|Fresh
This cool cat more than earns his stripes.|Fresh
Brilliantly cast and impeccably directed - the most exciting MCU entry in years.|Fresh
For all their global dominance, everybody wants these superhero movies to be better: funnier, smarter, more inclusive, more super. A huge step in the right direction, Black Panther is that dream come true.|Fresh
[Director Ryan Coogler has] raised the bar even higher here. Visually, Black Panther is unlike any movie I've ever seen.|Fresh
The movie has a beating heart, and a big one; it's not just sincere, but that rarest of birds in the jungle of mainstream entertainment, a heartfelt epic.|Fresh
What you don't expect from Marvel is a thoughtful story steeped in political parallels and the historical baggage of racial discrimination and suffering. That's what makes Black Panther unique among a teeming movie universe of extraordinary beings.|Fresh
Black Panther is a story we haven't seen told before in popular cinema - a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism.|Fresh
As the MCU lumbers to something of a climax in Avengers: Infinity War and looks beyond, the solid and satisfying Black Panther is a good standard-bearer for the next era... It's earnest, regal and ready to take over the MCU mantle.|Fresh
There is a lot going on in here, but again, a confident Coogler takes a frighteningly tall tale and somehow manages to make a clean, thrilling and largely inventive sci-fi adventure out of it.|Fresh
This is one superhero film that definitely punches above the normal crash-bang-wallop weight. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got a whole lot more interesting.|Fresh
"Visually, ""Black Panther"" is often spectacular...It's warriors with spears and force-field shields. It's aircraft that soar and swoop like birds over the Serengeti. It's ""Blade Runner"" in Dar es Salaam instead of L.A."|Fresh
Even if it had nothing else going for it, Black Panther would still be the best-looking Marvel movie yet.|Fresh
Until the formulaic final quarter, the film is fast, enjoyable and has several funny moments. The main actors are engaging, and its fun being introduced to new faces too.|Fresh
Black Panther is to the ongoing Marvel project as Coogler's Creed was to the Rocky movies - a film simultaneously beholden to its franchise and alive to every possibility within it, creating a new world within the existing master narrative.|Fresh
Coogler and his team have conjured a universe and fleshed out its players, one existing (honestly, thriving) in the even bigger cinematic universe that is Marvel.|Fresh
Not since Ant-Man has a Marvel film actually been about the hero in the title, but Black Panther is and it makes it all the better.|Fresh
Black Panther proves that you can make a movie that is significant to the black audience, and just a damn good superhero movie that everyone can enjoy.|Fresh
It may be named Black Panther, but the film is very much an ensemble piece with enough action and social commentary to carve out a place as one of Marvel's better standalone offerings.|Fresh
...Black Panther is one of the best Marvel films ever.|Fresh
A Shakespearean flavoured tragedy to its backstory, with palace intrigue and hidden secrets. Where Serkis's maniacally-laughing Klaue is a bad guy who wears thin, Killmonger is one of the few movie villains I've ever felt sorry for.|Fresh
The film constantly manages to subvert expectations, while remaining firmly within the action-packed superhero genre.|Fresh
Exactly the kind of risk Marvel should be taking with every film they make.|Fresh
Soundtracked by an authentic score, the movie has an electric rhythmicality; every scene bounces as if dancing to the beat of its own drum.|Fresh
Makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe a bigger, more interesting, more engaging place, one where for the first time women and people of color aren't limited to token or supporting roles.|Fresh
Dialogue heavy with a confused sense of place, this mega-budget Marvel marvel might be a misfire for anyone beyond the fan-base...|Rotten
Unlike a Tony Stark who can entertain with his dry wit or Captain America who dazzles with his passion for patriotism, Boseman must play both T'Challa as a man of great reserve. He's a warrior, but one who rules the screen with a quiet calm.|Fresh
Looking, sounding and feeling the way it does-wearing its anti-corporate, anti-fascist, anti-racist heart on its sleeve-it's a movie that, for sure, knows what's up.|Fresh
But what no trailer could prepare us for is director Ryan Coogler's skills at perfectly weaving socio-political lessons on love, culture community, isolation, personal responsibility and identity in between some pretty dope fight scenes.|Fresh
An ineffably adventurous, vibrant and compelling production. It's a blockbuster that is saying something, and believe me Marvel, we're listening.|Fresh
Michel B. Jordan plays Erik Killmonger with such moving, occasionally gut-wrenching commitment that it nearly mitigates the goofiness of his moniker and the superficiality of the film in toto.|Fresh
With gorgeous visuals from Wakanda to South Korea and back, vivid and bold Afrocentric costumes, and the support of some pretty bad-ass women, Black Panther is progressive, exciting, enveloping, and exactly what we all need in our lives right now.|Fresh
The first studio produced, major motion picture to feature a Black superhero Black Panther is a very good movie, exceptional beyond its big-budget entertainment values...|Fresh
Black Panther spirals into a stodgy tale of internecine feuding, in which T'Challa is required to come to terms with the sins of past generations. What he doesn't get to do much of is jump around beating-up bad guys. That's a shame.|Rotten
Crashingly enjoyable, frequently exciting and even, when it wants, borderline witty.|Fresh
It feels rich, expansive, and is clearly teeming with umpteen further stories, while it is also distinctive, authentic, and has a vitality that you can't help but become invested in.|Fresh
... it's a very rich buffet - geopolitical thriller, futuristic fantasy, coming-of-age story, African adventure with mystical overtones... it offers a wide variety of tastes and sensations but they never really come together to form a satisfying whole.|Fresh
Ryan Coogler's spectacular first foray into the Marvel universe is an absolute game-changer.|Fresh
Rarely has a superhero origin story been as satisfying as Black Panther, which in many ways doesn't feel like a typical Marvel movie - and more power to that.|Fresh
Black Panther doesn't just hit its marks. It leaves marks. Landmarks. So get in the queue now, people.|Fresh
Despite familiar action-scene wobbliness, it's easily the most engaging Marvel film in a long while. Because-finally!-it has something new to say. More like this please, Marvel. Oh, and, of course: Wakanda forever.|Fresh
Coogler was clearly given the freedom to explore his chosen themes and step outside the MCU mould.|Fresh
"""Black Panther"" matters."|Fresh
Black Panther succeeds at being emotionally resonant in a way a lot of Marvel movies-a lot of blockbusters, period-don't.|Fresh
The action sequences meet, but do not exceed, the industry standard.|Fresh
Hi-tech gadgets, jungle combat, vehicle chases, ready-made quips, casino hookups - there's something very James Bond-esque about Black Panther.|Fresh
"""Black Panther"" doesn't disappoint. It is splendidly endowed with awesome wizardry."|Fresh
The set designs are extraordinary, and the movie features a surprise ending --- especially for those who left the theatre prematurely --- with a timely message about international togetherness.|Fresh
Proves a Marvel film can aspire to be something more; it has political bite, emotional depth, ethical dilemmas, and regal jostling, but it still manages to maintain a bombastic comic book aesthetic that's spectacular.|Fresh
Black Panther is a comic masterpiece that transcends the genre. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Eric Killmonger, the best villain yet from Marvel Studios.|Fresh
The most visually arresting and memorable Marvel film to date.|Fresh
Black Panther is absolutely majestic.|Fresh
Above all, this is a superbly acted movie, stolen without remorse by Letitia Wright's work as Shuri, T'Challa's whip-smart sister, who outfits him with all of his vibranium-enhanced tech.|Fresh
The women of Black Panther do so much throughout the film, all while being funny, sensuous, smart and strong.|Fresh
...perhaps the most complete on screen encapsulation of the wild flights of imagination comics are capable of, grounded in astute, modern political sensibilities...|Fresh
Black Panther is set largely in Wakanda, with a detour to South Korea. Still, there's no shaking the feeling that this is what America looks like when it's allowed to be its truest, freest self. That's a superhero challenge if ever there was one.|Fresh
While ultimately an action-adventure, Black Panther also serves as an intelligent if broad debate between revolutionary rhetoric and the responsibilities of leadership.|Fresh
[A] tour de force, one of the smartest, most original action-packed blockbusters of the decade... bold and visually stunning filmmaking...|Fresh
I hope people notice how much drama Coogler got out of Black Panther the way they notice Thor: Ragnarok is so funny.|Fresh
It is black excellence exemplified that will leave audiences yearning to inhabit Wakanda forever.|Fresh
Black Panther is a hit! It's emotional, powerful and action packed to satisfy comic book fans as well as newcomers who probably haven't seen a Marvel film, but want to experience seeing Black excellence on the big screen.|Fresh
This is a superhero movie for the ages, and especially for this age.|Fresh
Inspiring and empowering in equal measure, Black Panther is a richer & deeper experience than most comic book fare.|Fresh
He is just getting better and better and knows how to develop characters in this emotional way that you're invested...this guy is a rising star. As great as every single actor is in this movie, Ryan Coogler, once again, is the star of this film.|Fresh
"Part spy thriller, part all-out battle and part social commentary, ""Black Panther"" is consistently propelled by tonal and thematic flourishes that break with the conventions that have defined the Marvel Cinematic Universe."|Fresh
The incredibly stellar cast is led by a majestic Chadwick Boseman, reprising the role of T'Challa and finding him at a cross-roads in his life.|Fresh
Yet it's The Walking Dead's Gurira who steals the show as the ferocious Okoye, gloriously swinging her spear in a billowing red gown.|Fresh
Black Panther is every bit as good as you were hoping. Actually -- it's better. A terrific screenplay from Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole elevates this thing way beyond the usual boundaries of the Marvel Universe.|Fresh
"Once ""Black Panther"" gets out of its crouching position and goes on a sprint, it's an engaging ride that rarely lets up."|Fresh
You believe in T'Challa, you believe in Wakanda, and you believe - maybe for the first time - that the MCU actually matters.|Fresh
It's easy to lament how long it took to bring Black Panther to the big screen. But at least the wait was worth it.|Fresh
"Like ""Wonder Woman"" last year, ""Black Panther"" is a project that fans have been waiting decades to see. And just like ""Wonder Woman,"" it was worth the wait."|Fresh
Production design, costumes, and of course, visual effects are all on point, and newly minted Oscar-nominee Rachel Morrison shoots every frame to embrace the sumptuous detail.|Fresh
While watching Black Panther, you know you're watching a cosmic shift in comic book storytelling. We've never seen anything so vibrant and so different from the monotony of superhero films.|Fresh
I left the theater wanting to see this movie at least 10 more times.|Fresh
Black Panther pounces toward the head of the class in a way that should make the King, and his key subjects, a cornerstone of an already-formidable roster.|Fresh
"The initial Twitter responses hailing it as a ""masterpiece"" go way overboard... [but Coogler] assembled one of the finest acting lineups ever recruited for a Marvel movie--or any genre outing, for that matter."|Fresh
Black Panther perfects what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always done so well: build a world so richly rendered, it's almost a letdown to reach the end of the film and realize it's time to return to our own reality.|Fresh
Black Panther isn't just levelling out representation in Hollywood, it's inspiring the next generation of real-life heroes, and that's what makes this film truly magnificent.|Fresh
Black Panther has surpassed Iron Man as the best film of the MCU.|Fresh
You can see [Michael B.] Jordan offhandedly weighing the line in his mind like a rock he's about to lob: it's one of many nicely judged moments of performance here from a wildly appealing ensemble cast without a weak link.|Fresh
Not only does it live up to the expected levels of epic exhilaration, it surpasses them, digging its claws into real-world social and political profundity.|Fresh
Black Panther asks how we retain our moral compass in the face of people who invite us to give in to our baser instincts.|Fresh
"When ""Black Panther"" works, it's thrillingly alive."|Fresh
The director Ryan Coogler and a charismatic cast... turn racial clichés on their head and drag in some heavy Shakespearean conflict to create a vivid yarn that's entirely new, frequently startling and, at every step along the way, all Marvel.|Fresh
"We didn't know we'd been yearning for it until it arrived, but now that it's here it's unmistakable that the wait for a film like ""Black Panther"" has been way longer than it should have been."|Fresh
The Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked.|Fresh
Coogler has proven he can play in the big boys' house.|Fresh
Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one.|Fresh
Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful, moving, and thematically resonant films to date. It's also one of its most uneven, when all is said and done.|Fresh
While the themes are deep, Black Panther is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness, insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda,|Fresh
Coogler has taken every genre in which black characters are traditionally sidelined, and then, with considerable flair and boldness, he's combined those genres and put black characters right at their heart.|Fresh
The intriguing thing about Black Panther is that it doesn't look like a superhero film - more a wide-eyed fantasy romance: exciting, subversive and funny.|Fresh
Black Panther feels like the beginning of something new.|Fresh
Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is a revelation. Wright steals every scene with her bright smile and perfect comedic timing.|Fresh
Black Panther celebrates its hero's heritage while delivering one of Marvel's most all-around appealing standalone installments to date.|Fresh
As a nerd and as a black man, I've been waiting for this movie for my entire life, whether I knew it or not. The fact that Black Panther gets so much right, but one crucial thing wrong, is both thrilling and maddening.|Fresh
Thank God for the women beside [Boseman], including his regal mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett), brainiac baby sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and fearless warrior-protector Okoye (Danai Gurira). They're indomitable, and so gorgeously, vividly drawn.|Fresh
"""Black Panther"" features all the right ingredients to become one of the most successful superhero films of all time."|Fresh
With uncanny timing, Marvel takes its superheroes into a domain they've never inhabited before and is all the better for it in Black Panther.|Fresh
Say this about Black Panther, which raises movie escapism very near the level of art: You've never seen anything like it in your life.|Fresh
Even if it wasn't for the joy of seeing so many black faces on screen, it would be a must-see for its gripping plot, superb images, thrilling action and excellent actors. [Full review in French]|Fresh
A giddily enjoyable, convention-bucking 134-minute epic that somehow manages to simultaneously be a comic-book blockbuster, a pulsating espionage thriller and an Afro-futurist family saga.|Fresh
