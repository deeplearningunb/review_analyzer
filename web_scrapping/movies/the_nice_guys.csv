The Nice Guys is an anomaly - it's a summertime actioner starring two hugely popular actors that seems specifically designed for the sensibilities of the over-35 demographic.|Fresh
With a pairing of the comedic charm from Ryan Gosling and the pure grit of Russell Crowe the Nice Guys are a match...|Fresh
Strip away the jokes that are the backbone of this terrific movie and you would still be left with one of the most solid crime thrillers in recent memory.|Fresh
Crowe has always been an underrated comedian and here he is to the manor born with a role that suits his gruff, but warm, persona perfectly, and Gosling nails his role too.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is a hilarious breath of fresh air that gives us new perspectives on Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, but also a new star on the rise in Angourie Rice.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is a yet another jewel on the crown of Shane Black's gleaming crown of a career, once again reaffirming himself as one of cinema's darlings.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is a fun action-thriller with winning performances from Gosling and Rice. I pray Shane Black continues churning out these hysterical stabs at noir pulp fiction.|Fresh
There's no arguing with the pitch-perfect imagery of smog-swathed L.A. in the Seventies, nor with the shaggy-dog-seeming but actually well-structured storytelling. Also, The Nice Guys earns a lot of laughs, which is always, well, nice.|Fresh
Gosling has never been funnier. His timing is priceless. Great stuff from Crowe.|Fresh

A timeless caper that is well paced, greatly detailed, tightly written, and hysterically funny all the through.|Fresh
An archivist's dream: an action comedy about film preservation.|Fresh
"It's ultimately Gosling and Crowe's dynamic that is the strength of the film. ""The Nice Guys"" is aware of itself; it's silly and occasionally ridiculous, but in all the best ways possible."|Fresh
Even if you didn't grow up in the '70's, you'll love this retro cop comedy... The music, the clothes, the cars, the hair, the banter... [will] make you want to grab your hair pick and head to the disco.|Fresh
While it has its laugh out loud moments, there just isn't enough content to make it worth paying the price of a theater ticket.|Rotten
Nice Guys is more than a worthwhile movie going experience.|Fresh
Their failure is admirable in this one sense: they didn't let mastery of conventional cinematic form get in the way of shouty commentary about contemporary class relations.|Fresh
Such a perfectly enticing mystery detective story. Honestly, this movie has it all.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is less about characterization, and more about letting two actors loose that have clearly found a groove for turning great material into gold|Fresh
Replete with nudity and violence, if eccentric crime dramas with a dash of dark comedy are up your street, The Nice Guys is your film.|Fresh
It's a wholesome mix of movie genres.|Fresh
Crowe is better -- and funnier -- than he has been for a long while but Gosling struggles to bring his character (a hard-drinking single father) to life, while Black takes the easy comedy option rather too often. Still, I wouldn't mind a sequel.|Fresh
They're flawed but likeable characters, set in an outlandish, ridiculously entertaining story. You've got to see The Nice Guys.|Fresh
Who would have thought that Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling would have such great comic chemistry?|Fresh
What's memorable about The Nice Guys is the crew of not-so-nice kids: the 12- through 18-year-olds who seem remarkably unbothered when bumping heads with coke-addled pornographers.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is a piece of contemporary cinema that encompasses everything I love about where we are. It's self-aware, it's clever and above all else, it accepts the faults of people and uses them to create a story about finding humanity.|Fresh
From its opening shot, The Nice Guys charms with an exuberant commitment to cutting, panning, and switching between perspectives, establishing the pertinent plot with no filler.|Fresh
Gosling does a lot of physical comedy throughout the film, and he's a genius at it. The simple act of busting a glass window with his fist results in a comedy of errors that had me laughing for a solid two minutes|Fresh
There's just as many laughs as there are gunshots and Gosling's slapstick physicality and Crowe's wry dialogue bring some much-needed light to the dark.|Fresh
Chances are if you liked Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and similar slacker-neo-noir capers like The Big Lebowski (1998) and 2014's Inherent Vice, you'll be happy with The Nice Guys. Best enjoyed with tongue firmly in cheek.|Fresh
Take two heavyweight Hollywood stars, cast them in a shaggy-dog story set in Los Angeles circa 1977 and assign a writer-director with a proven flair for madcap action comedy. Voila! It's time to get acquainted with The Nice Guys.|Fresh
Amid countless remakes like Vacation and sequels like Neighbors 2, which doggedly push for crude atmospheres, this film creates a world that's pure and naturally absurd.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are a good match in The Nice Guys. But writer-director Shane Black's screenplay seldom strikes fire.|Fresh
Major props must go to the film's production team for recreating the sounds & looks of the 1970s with such matter-of-fact precision...Some of the suburban street scenes look so authentic it's as though they were filmed with the aid of a time machine.|Fresh
The thing that sets this movie apart is the magic that happens between Gosling, Crowe, and Rice.|Fresh
With a story of smart dips and dives in bell-bottoms over shag carpet and groovy lava lamps, The Nice Guys is sure to go down in history as sophisticated escapism.|Fresh
An almost perfect attempt to exactly split the difference between Lethal Weapon and The Big Lebowski, except it's not quite as good as either one.|Fresh
For a while there, something magical was brewing. In the end, it plays like a particularly raunchy and plot-heavy pilot episode to a '70s-era crime-solving buddy series.|Fresh
[Shane] Black likes his characters and loves the genre and that's enough to make the tribute / pastiche / affection parody work.|Fresh
The plot is as convoluted as a Raymond Chandler novel, but Black and his cast deliver the action with such brio and panache that the film remains hugely entertaining even if, like Gosling's hapless hero, you've barely a clue what is going on.|Fresh
Outrageously funny from start to finish...The two leads play off each other perfectly.|Fresh
With his third stint as director, Black has found his niche in evoking great performances, and framing engrossing and entertaining stories. The conclusion of The Nice Guys hints at a sequel. Please let it happen.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is a glorious mess of a movie.|Fresh
A refreshing film due to its excessive violence and hilarious originality. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Shane Black's The Nice Guys is a splendid tribute to mystery films of the 70s, featuring a good dose of black humor and surprisingly great chemistry between leads Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.|Fresh

Too often, The Nice Guys feels like the Funniest Film of 1994. There are worse things.|Fresh

Watching Crowe and Gosling-who are admittedly enjoying themselves in their respective roles-is fun, but the road wears thin along the journey...|Rotten
This sordid 1970's fast-talking detective noir is the perfect sandbox for filmmaker Shane Black.|Fresh
A perfect mix of Boogie Nights and Inherent Vice, but without being as dense or as acid as the second one. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The cast, the story and tone make this a film worthwhile. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film works perfectly due to the laughs, shootings, self awareness and excellent comedic timing, but also the influence of noir cinema and the work of Paul Thomas Anderson. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

All about the chemistry between Gosling and Crowe, and the witty script, and the saucy tone, and the vintage textures, and the unexpected comic twists.|Fresh
...a sporadically entertaining, exceedingly well-acted diversion.|Fresh
'The Nice Guys' is anarchic, irreverent, juvenile and sometimes downright uncomfortable, but it's also occasionally hilarious. ... A provocative film that pretends to be more stupid than it is.|Fresh
Crowe and Gosling have a wonderful, gruff chemistry here, which is key. If this is the beginning of a Lethal Weapon style franchise for the two actors, count me in.|Fresh
Cartoon pulp.|Fresh

The director know that in order to make the movie work, he has to include the spectator on the joke. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling represent polar opposites of movie masculinity. It's one of the reasons why their first film together, Shane Black's knowing comic thriller The Nice Guys, is such a pungent delight.|Fresh
'The Nice Guys' delivers action-packed, retro fun.|Fresh
A witty but tough noir thriller that offers a greatest hits compilation of the writer-director's best work to date, as well as something a little bit new.|Fresh
Not so much a mainstreamed 'Inherent Vice' as a civilian superhero movie for those who think they're too smart or 'adult' for costumed superhero movies.|Fresh
Full of style and cinema to the top. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Unapologetic, wonderful, fun, sacastic and lucid. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""The Nice Guys"" turns on the chemistry between Gosling's manic detective and Crowe's tough-but-humorous Healy."|Fresh
There is an interesting enough mix of verbal comedy and slapstick to keep most amused some of the time and then, well, there's Ryan who works for so many of us on a different level.|Fresh
A comedy of groovy errors|Fresh
The Nice Guys is smart-dumb fun for grown-ups, a mainstream summer palate-cleanser amidst the glut of Spandex-clad superheroes.|Fresh
It isn't always pretty but The Nice Guys is an unashamedly absurd, self-mocking, guilty pleasure of a film.|Fresh
These Nice Guys finish last.|Rotten
More slapstick than gumshoe, The Nice Guys is at its best when riffing broadly on the chaotic chemistry between its chalk-and-cheese male stars.|Fresh
They may sound like an unorthodox pairing given that we're accustomed to seeing them in dramatic roles but the pairing of Crowe and Gosling works well.|Fresh
Mr Gosling is as new to comedy as Mr Crowe, but embraces it fearlessly in a role that requires little dignity and plenty of pratfalls.|Fresh
As buddy movies go, it has enough irreverence and originality never just to seem like a cynical rehash of a kind of film that has been made countless times before.|Fresh
The movie enjoys all the politically incorrect pleasures of the Seventies with a knowing chuckle.|Fresh
Two fun characters played by two great actors with fantastic chemistry together go in search of a movie, and - spoiler! - never quite find it.|Rotten
The Nice Guys makes you want to catch hold of the first random stranger unfortunate enough to cross your path and demand that they drop everything and watch it.|Fresh
I found it laboured, clumsy and for a film designed to provoke laughs, nastily and unacceptably violent.|Rotten
Director Shane Black may have surprised with The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996), Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) and the first two Lethal Weapon movies, but his latest is a shadow of past glories.|Rotten
Writer-director Shane Black returns to the comedy-noir vibe of his 2005 hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with this riotously funny thriller set in late-1970s Los Angeles.|Fresh
An absolute joy of a film.|Fresh
It's all hugely enjoyable, packing punches and more laughs than most straightforward comedies, and a successful return to the neo-noir well after Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.|Fresh
Its over-exuberance is entirely forgivable.|Fresh
A defiantly old-school action comedy that delivers big where it really counts.|Fresh
Riotously entertaining action-comedy that combines old-school detective thrills with laugh-out-loud humour and blackly comic violence.|Fresh
There are shades of The Big Lebowski in its narrative, which spins out to outlandish lengths only to culminate in a bit of throwaway irony.|Fresh
Funny and occasionally pleasingly absurd, there are no nice guys in The Nice Guys, just a couple of endearing losers who will have you in stitches.|Fresh
While you'll probably laugh at the stars' buddy-movie shenanigans, you'll certainly hate yourself in the morning for it -- even if this director never does.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is on another level altogether-wildly entertaining and frequently hilarious. (Splice Today)|Fresh
A fun but admittedly violent comedy that features a truly great standout performance by Ryan Gosling.|Fresh
When it comes to buddy/action comedies, director and screenwriter Shane Black knows what he's doing.|Fresh
After a while, when you've given up on laughing out loud, you start smiling for those old-fashioned reasons: you're enjoying the characters and the scrape they find themselves in.|Fresh
For a knockabout farce, The Nice Guys scores high on the charts.|Fresh
A crime tale that leaves the screwball comedy bruised and bloody with a retro reinvention of sorts.|Fresh
... a wonderfully loopy buddy comedy ... Black's thing remains shaggy-dog humor mixed with offhand bursts of violence. Crowe and Gosling channel the nitwit camaraderie of Abbott & Costello|Fresh
Fun, violence, crazyness, awesome production values and a cool main cast. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Shane Black's crisp dialogue, a gift he uniquely has, is a standout and does a solid job in the directing department and keeps the action moving, but it's a sense of Deja vu|Fresh
The very notion of Healey and March's working relationship is absurd but writer-director Shane Black and co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi construct a script that makes no apologies for its absurd twists and indelicate situations.|Fresh
It's such fun watching the pair muddle their way through a labyrinth of bad vibes.|Fresh
Crowe and Gosling make a good bottom-feeding team (Gosling especially shows a surprising flair for physical comedy).|Fresh
Their slapstick physicality (especially Gosling's) and wry dialogue is worth a laugh, but is that due to the script or because it's two serious stars being funny? I think it's more the latter.|Fresh
What may be surprising- -- or not -- is the camaraderie between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. Their comedy is akin to Two Stooges.|Fresh
Writer/director Shane Black is back with another Private Eye flick and this is a good one...overcoming a byzantine plot that never really does make any sense with a witty script, fine acting and directing, and terrific cinematography .|Fresh
They aren't cops, they're just scumbags of slightly different shades. But the odd-couple dynamic is straight out of the Lethal Weapon playbook and it still works a charm.|Fresh
Gosling and Crowe are great in a movie that is only good.|Fresh
Now, I'm not saying every gumshoe yarn needs physical comedy, but The Nice Guys makes joyous use of the stuff.|Fresh
A gritty, cynical, hilarious, and mostly satisfying bit of L.A. noir, Shane Black's The Nice Guys sees the bad boy writer-director make a slick return to his signature brand of buddy action comedy.|Fresh
Makes concessions to nothing and nobody - it is about as pure an expression of the writer/director's sensibilities as you could ask for.|Fresh
Quick on its wits and fast with its fists, this is Black firmly back doing what he does best. And nobody out there does it better.|Fresh
Shane Black's passion can never quite be contained within the boundaries of good taste and I love that about him.|Fresh
The jokes are funny, but consequences still feel real, and that gives the story a level of depth hard to achieve in screwball comedies of this ilk.|Fresh
A cool little neo-noir gem.|Fresh
Rude, raunchy, violent and very funny action-comedy-mystery with two great leads and a surprisingly terrific newcomer. All in all, I'd call it good unwholesome fun.|Fresh
Meekly mustachioed Ryan Gosling and a Russell Crowe slowly morphing into John Goodman make consistently amusing anti-buddies.|Fresh
The best comedy of the year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"[Shane] Black's weakest effort in an age, a shoot-from-the-hip P.I. comedy that isn't half as interesting as ""Inherent Vice"" and barely as funny."|Fresh
Black has a potent weapon in Gosling, who's at his zaniest here, his moist eyes and drooping moustache evoking the 1990s Nicolas Cage.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is very much in the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang vein - part thriller, part spoof. And Crowe and Gosling turn out to be very funny, embellishing their performances with some noteworthy '70s fashion items.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is a madcap ride with some bumps along the way but there is beauty in the chaos.|Fresh
While The Nice Guys is definitely a popcorn movie front-loaded with cracking comic interplay and surreal set-piece action sequences, the package as a whole packs a pulpy punch that cannot be denied.|Fresh
Most of the laughs are solid and the underlying tone of the film is pitched in such a way that it doesn't undermine our inherent investment in the mystery or the appeal of the characters|Fresh
The Nice Guys is a blast...|Fresh
In a competition between Shane Black first directorial effort and his third, The Nice Guys finishes second.|Fresh
Sliding into theaters between 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'X-Men: Apocalypse', its busted-out protagonists are a long way from spandex-land. This works to its advantage; 'The Nice Guys' is a goof and a treat, but it's also a breath of fresh air.|Fresh
If you like your films to zig-zag for entertainment, this is an always engaging and edgy work, carrying Black's signature elements of conflicting textures which created the sardonic action buddy comedy franchise, Lethal Weapon|Fresh
The tone is offbeat, the juxtaposition of ideas occasionally inspires and goofy moments entertain; yet overall the film never quite satisfies or rises to the level to which it aspires|Fresh
Black layers in devilish sight gag after sight gag with smooth pulpy nuance, while maintaining the requisite forward motion.|Fresh
Shane Black's The Nice Guys isn't terrible -- it just ducks mediocrity -- but every advance it takes toward quality is made on the strengths of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.|Rotten
The Nice Guys is just pure wackiness all the way through - a straight-up crime mystery filled with hilarious antics and plenty of violence. A perfect addition to the summer movie roster.|Fresh
Gosling makes an excellent alcoholic fall guy, Crowe, although quite a tub nowadays, is as enthusiastic a thumper as ever.|Fresh
"With its sloppy plot, fair to middling acting, and a cheesy look of the seventies ""The Nice Guys"" is not a nice movie."|Rotten
"Black strips the ""Lethal Weapon"" formula down to its undies and redresses it with moxie and snark."|Fresh
The Crowe-Gosling team might stir unhappy memories of what-were-they-thinking? twofers like Pat Morita and Jay Leno (Collision Course), Ted Danson and Howie Mandel (A Fine Mess) or Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds (R.I.P.D.), but they're a dynamic duo.|Fresh
Gosling has a knack for physical comedy and self-deprecation that gleefully subverts a decade-plus of rom-coms and Nicolas Winding Refn movies.|Fresh
Shane Black's best work yet... a smart, funny, sexy action movie... You can tell Black would be happy making films like this for the rest of his life -- and we should be so luck.|Fresh
The Nice Guys has a riveting mystery wrapped around a balls-out explosive action comedy that undeniably results in one of the funniest and most entertaining films of the year. This is the first must-see film of the summer.|Fresh
An invigorating sense of style and attitude, combined with a witty script and charismatic performances, give a considerable boost to what could have been a pedestrian noir thriller.|Fresh
...at once very violent, very funny, and a true original.|Fresh
a nail-bitingly suspenseful, wickedly funny, and decidedly hard-boiled neo-Noir pitting nihilism against idealism during the candy-colored decadence of 1977 Los Angeles.|Fresh
A wildly entertaining albeit convoluted dark comedy with witty, funny and crackling dialogue and palpable chemistry Crowe and Gosling.|Fresh
Shane Black re-writes the buddy movie template and gives Crowe a second chance and a franchise. Lots of nasty, unrepentant violence and hookers. Pure enjoyment.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is like James Ellroy by way of Abbott & Costello. Frequently hilarious, often surprising, and consistently fun.|Fresh
... with a winning starring duo and an expertise in grimy, twisty crime stories, Black has made a film that uses its route structure to its advantage to deliver a taste of delicious pulp fiction.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is an entertainingly breezy buddy-detective romp that steadfast Shane Black fans ought to get additional mileage from.|Fresh
"""There are never really any new toys in Shane Black's sandbox but he always plays with them better than the other kids."""|Fresh
In the era of comic book superhero over-saturation, Hollywood can certainly stand the originality|Fresh
The New Guys is fast, violent, and doesn't feel like it came out of the summer-movie food processor.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is a strange combination of what Sean Black does best, but his neo-noir feels awkward mixed with buddy cop.|Fresh
A heckuva entertaining film.|Fresh
[Shane Black] never lets the film breathe, and The Nice Guys gets smothered by its own smugness.|Rotten
"Director and co-writer Shane Black (the grand ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") offers up '70s-era laughs by the guffaw-full, including one great bit in which Gosling borrows heavily from the very late and ever-great Lou Costello."|Fresh
You need to see The Nice Guys for, hands down, the greatest comedic performance of the year. It belongs to Ryan Gosling.|Fresh
Crowe and Gosling have mismatched-buddy chemistry to burn. Black riffs on LA Confidential, 48HRs and his own Lethal Weapon script.|Fresh
You may not recognize Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling in Nice Guys. Here's why that's a good thing.|Fresh
Freewheeling buddy comedy has lots of mature content.|Fresh
A nice summer treat.|Fresh
Despite its plot's mechanical issues, The Nice Guys has all the makings of must-see DVD and Blu-ray, when its long-winded story can be offset by the ability to rewind and rewatch some truly funny moments.|Fresh
A throwback to an earlier era, when big movies could still have strange little touches and lots of edge.|Fresh
Few genres are more fun than a buddy movie done right. Crowe and Gosling have a blast with these characters and you get to share in the fun.|Fresh
I'd say they don't make them like this anymore, but they just did.|Fresh
The brilliantly conceived L.A. auto show climax is like a Rube Goldberg action piece.|Fresh
You won't see Captain America and Iron Man squaring off at an airport, but you do get Russell Crowe breaking Ryan Gosling's arm and then cheerfully downing a Yoo-hoo.|Fresh
These are smart comedic performances, which more than compensates for the feeling that the pairing is ordinary.|Fresh
The plot doesn't and doesn't have to make much sense, as the whole point is just to watch Gosling and Crowe tool around a long-lost L.A. in a convertible, trade quips and insults, and occasionally shoot people.|Fresh
"The biggest problem with ""The Nice Guys"" is that it can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up --- a comedy or a violent thriller?"|Rotten
Crowe and Gosling do exhibit an on-screen chemistry, but I would like to see them together in a better film.|Rotten
Something of a hip, sexy, violent homage to the comedy stylings of Abbott and Costello, with the roles reversed.|Fresh
Crowe and Gosling haven't been this engaging or energised on screen in years.|Fresh
The most fun consenting adults can legally have in a movie theater this summer.|Fresh
Might go down as the biggest missed opportunity of the summer.|Rotten
"If you enjoyed the banter, stylings, and male bonding chemistry of a bygone era in the first ""Lethal Weapon"" flick, you'll probably have the same reaction to this. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Nudity, Violence, Profanity etc. - Available)"|Fresh
It's not an especially successful film, but here's a handy tip: if you're not laughing within the first ten minutes, there's no reason to hang around for the remaining 100.|Rotten
"Of all the year's movies that are not ""Deadpool,"" The Nice Guys might be the funniest. Well, it's one of them."|Fresh
The film is at its best when Crowe and Gosling are on screen together. They create movie magic; their collective charisma explodes off the screen.|Fresh
The film works because it swerves and slips and slides around itself with a sort of thrilling abandon.|Fresh
As an alternative for grown-ups looking to avoid the sequels and general noise of summer, The Nice Guys won't finish last. But it could have -- and should have -- been so much more.|Fresh
It's a testament to [Black's] confidence as a filmmaker that such odd touches fit seamlessly into this crazy, nimble detective yarn.|Fresh
The mix of wit, slapstick, and mayhem has some dead-on period detail and some shrewd commentary on contemporary issues.|Fresh
Shane Black is back doing the thing he does better than anyone else, writing and directing deliriously entertaining action comedies about mismatched partners battling an escalating threat.|Fresh
This movie starts at full speed and never stops. While there are flaws, watching these actors let loose amid a collage of explosions, gunfire, drugs and filth is just too fun to slight Black for some clichés.|Fresh
Shane Black's The Nice Guys brings us a 1970s that's halfway between Inherent Vice and the Beastie Boys' Sabotage video, shabby and scrappy and loose.|Fresh
The Nice Guys makes up for weak characters by consistently subverting the cliches of action movie filmmaking.|Fresh
Some viewers may find the violence a bit much, although it does lean toward the cartoonish... Best of all, it's funny. It's fair to say that in this instance, Nice Guys do finish first.|Fresh
It creates great on-screen chemistry between Gosling and Crowe - as brute adversaries who partner up as private eyes to solve a criminal conspiracy. And it blows your mind with its sense of absurdity - even while making the crime caper count.|Fresh
Because this is set in Los Angeles in the 1970s, we're supposed to think back to Chinatown and The Long Goodbye and excuse the opaque plot, around which Black's eccentric gags float like seasoned croutons in bland soup.|Rotten
"The nefarious plot at the core of ""The Nice Guys"" doesn't hold up to the most casual scrutiny. Fortunately, about everything else does in this entertaining crime comedy, from the look to the tone to the throwaway details."|Fresh
For a movie predicated on slapstick forward momentum, we spend an awful lot of time driving backward.|Rotten
Though the plot here may be a confusing, multi-threaded mess ... it's occasionally offset by the exuberance with which Black blends splatter and slapstick, and the leeway he grants his two very game leads.|Fresh
It freshens the odd-couple formula with some nice period and father-daughter twists.|Fresh
Plenty of general-interest slapstick, wordplay, and buffoonery, adding up to a loopy, well-assembled lark.|Fresh
"Everything has its own illogic in ""The Nice Guys,"" a consistently entertaining, frequently violent and generally slapdash action comedy directed by Shane Black."|Fresh
Gosling and Crowe do have chemistry, and an obvious sense of humor which gets them far. They'd have gotten farther, though, if the movie, while at times hilarious, didn't have such an uneven feel.|Fresh
The concept is solid and Black's formula for this kind of film has worked before. Where The Good Guys goes astray is in Black's decision to downplay the '70s as fodder for his script and the casting of Gosling as the quirky private detective.|Rotten
Crowe and Gosling are having some career fun here. It's just contagious enough if you don't expect too much more than that.|Fresh
The best thing The Nice Guys has going for it are two laid-back, easygoing, deeply likable performances by its stars.|Fresh
Although it hits all of the usual beats of a Shane Black feature, The Nice Guys does so with such remarkable efficiency, brimming with witty banter, solid action and even a little heart, that it feels totally fresh.|Fresh
Until going off the rails, The Nice Guys is a locomotive breath of retro air, an action comedy winking while wallowing in slapstick brutality. Punchlines that are actual punches, bones broken funny, that sort of thing.|Fresh
While the characters are distinctive and charming, and the dialogue is often pretty funny, The Nice Guys is a large step down on the ambition scale from Kiss Kiss.|Fresh
"The sheer chaos of it all is exactly what makes ""The Nice Guys"" such a fun ride."|Fresh
Strong physical comedy, great timing, winning dialogue and off-the-charts chemistry all make The Nice Guys a hilarious ride.|Fresh
Perhaps unfocused and off-balance at times, but conveying a sense of buoyancy that's as cheerfully contagious as it is freewheeling.|Fresh
Does it include scenes that some may find painful to watch? You bet. Will you be entertained? Thoroughly.|Fresh
A juicy, slam-bang action-comedy cocktail punched up, pimped out and powered down with rowdy, new-fangled film-noir fun.|Fresh
Absolutely the most fun you'll have in a movie theater this summer.|Fresh
The Nice Guys borrows from noir traditions and pulp fiction, throwing a fresh coat of smart-alecky comedy over the whole thing.|Fresh
There's no reason why it shouldn't be both great fun and warmly human, but alas, it just isn't either.|Rotten
The Nice Guys is more than a nice time at the movies. It's a total delight.|Fresh
It all adds up to The Nice Guys being cool, man, very cool.|Fresh
Crowe and Gosling save the day. They both look like hell for most of the film, with neither actor demonstrating a wisp of vanity as they throw themselves into this cheerfully nasty mess.|Fresh
Laughter trumps logic here, and the laughs flow freely.|Fresh
The porn, the drugs, the smog, the bad haircuts - you can play it for laughs or play it straight. With terrific performances from Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, Black does a little of both.|Fresh
The film overflows with quips, irony, and physical gags while at the same time relating a noir-tinged story of seedy corruption set in the neon-saturated underbelly of the 1977 Los Angeles porn industry.|Fresh
A likably tetchy comedy squinting its way through the chest cough of Los Angeles smog circa 1977.|Fresh
The Nice Guys may not be Chinatown, but it could be an updated Lethal Weapon.|Fresh
Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make for a great comedy duo in this dark, cynical noir with an unexpectedly earnest center.|Fresh
Crowe and Gosling are fine, but they never form a genuine rapport. These actors are known for intensity and screen-hogging, not warmth or comedic timing, and here they seem to be moving in parallel but not fully in sync.|Rotten
An affectionate parody of the sort of mismatched-buddy action comedies that proliferated in the seventies and eighties, better than most of them were.|Fresh
No, it doesn't deliver anything new. But it does bring back something old and for 100 minutes or so, that's enough.|Fresh
This run-down, wood-paneled world of AMC Pacers and The Pina Colada Song makes an appropriate setting for this lightweight yet diverting action comedy that, aside from being too long, has the sense not to take itself too seriously.|Fresh
"Even nostalgic nonsense requires more than attitude and energy, which is all that Mr. Black has to offer. And despite all its restless detective work, ""The Nice Guys"" is unable to track down a soul or a reason for being."|Rotten
The Nice Guys never lives up to the promise of its hilarious first 10 minutes, but Crowe and Gosling are good enough to leave you hoping for a sequel.|Fresh
The pair bounce so successfully off one another that this feels like a double act for the ages, in a film that actually deserves to spawn a sequel.|Fresh
"Is it fun? Parts, yes, and many will get exactly what they wanted from ""The Nice Guys"": violence, wisecracks, a couple of choice sight gags ... plus the usual angry-mismatched-buddy-cops-but-not-really-cops routine."|Fresh
"""The Nice Guys"" is basically ""Chinatown"" remade by Quentin Tarantino and starring foulmouthed, updated versions of Abbott and Costello, as played by two of the most recognizable male stars of our time. Make your purchasing decisions accordingly."|Fresh
It's a bombardment of audacity and outrageous humor that never lets up.|Fresh
The Nice Guys is another sub-mental movie for morons churned out by the kind of sophomoric Hollywood machine that trademarks the works of Judd Apatow & Co.|Rotten
The Nice Guys is funny enough when it sticks to its heroes-whether pinned in a tight spot or bickering with each other-that its less-than-compelling intrigues and digressions come as an acceptable trade-off.|Fresh
It nicely captures the seediness of L.A. in the '70s , but, despite a very encouraging first act, it loses steam and gets bogged down in its own narrative.|Rotten
Consistently funny from beginning to end, even as the story eventually runs out of steam.|Fresh
This one's a cheerfully violent blast to the past that's as comfy as a broken in go-go boot.|Fresh
Surprisingly, as a character piece observing two loners who just might be made for each other, The Nice Guys shines far brighter than expected.|Fresh
Gosling and Crowe give very charming, lighter-than-air performances.|Fresh
Boisterous and bombastic without sacrificing the dark cynicism at its heart, The Nice Guys is a violent, propulsive, and knowingly trashy caper that puts a premium on hell-for-leather, hard-hitting entertainment value.|Fresh
Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are clearly enjoying the hell out of each other in this crime caper set in 1977 Los Angeles. So how can you resist?|Fresh
Crowe and Gosling are a perfect mismatch. They skulk around Los Angeles like a bear and a weasel who just escaped from the circus.|Fresh
One of the purest expressions of Black's aesthetic, a bloody, hilarious, convoluted mystery that's as funny as it's dark.|Fresh
Playing like a spiritual sibling to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys is laud-out-loud funny and edge-of-your-seat exciting.|Fresh
The movie is a throwback in many ways but also proves a dynamic duo can still be just as effective in modern cinema as a superhero ensemble cast. For The Nice Guys, it takes two to make it outta sight.|Fresh
"[Crowe and Gosling] become a surprisingly brilliant comedy duo, carrying ""The Nice Guys"" past a few flat jokes, needed edits and a cluttered finale."|Fresh
An energetically acerbic, sneakily touching joyride through a bygone vision of Hollywood.|Fresh
Glorious mayhem reigns left, right and centre in one of the best - and certainly funniest - films of 2016 to date.|Fresh
It's overlong by about 15 minutes and goes in too many directions at once. But thanks to a groovy period vibe and the A-list stars, you're along for the ride.|Fresh
Shane Black's The Nice Guys doesn't want for great exchanges, and even disposable conversations brim with acidic wit.|Fresh
The duo's swearier Abbott and Costello routine is an endless riot, fueled mainly by Gosling's full-bodied nervy cowardice. His high-pitched girlish scream is ever so beautiful.|Fresh
The Nice Guys, ultimately, might be a little too nice, but Black and his cast really want you to have a ball.|Fresh
Gosling does enough stumbling and bumbling and falling from balconies (twice!) to earn the term Keatonesque.|Fresh
Basically, it's Inherent Vice without the highbrow aspirations, or The Big Lebowski with two Dudes.|Fresh
In Gosling's pairing with the laconic Crowe, it finds a genuinely pleasurable pair of losers trying hard to eke out a win.|Fresh
Watching it you can picture its makers agonizing over the script's every inch: making sure each quip was jot-down-able, each plot turn surprising, each plant given a showstopping payoff.|Fresh
"Funny, in that casually violent Shane Black way. But Russell Crowe, as ""Saturday Night Live"" proved, has no flair for comedy. At all."|Fresh
The Nice Guys spends two hours treating Crowe and Gosling like a pair of piñatas, beating them mercilessly and unapologetically, and it's watching them crawl out from underneath and towards some form of redemption that makes the film a genuine smash.|Fresh
Shane Black's 'The Nice Guys' is exactly the movie you wanted it to be.|Fresh
Crowe and Gosling nail it and make this one of the year's most air-punchingly enjoyable movies.|Fresh
The detective genre has persisted because it has everything you could want from a film - intrigue, action, suspense, romance, adventure and humanity - and Black's latest delivers all of that.|Fresh
This feels like a movie I should already be referencing as an example of the type of movie that studios don't make anymore, but I can't because it's new.|Fresh
Subversively skewed, this fast-paced action/comedy is filled with unpredictable chaos and wickedly clever confusion.|Fresh
maintains a breezy appeal despite its mishmash of tones. Black's vision of burnt-out SoCal crisis isn't about the issues themselves but the flawed people grappling with them.|Fresh
There's little else quite like this fast-paced, deeply funny mystery - except Shane Black's other films|Fresh
"Gosling and Crowe's breezy give-and-take goes a long way in elevating ""The Nice Guys"" above the moments where cynicism overwhelms the comedy."|Fresh
The Nice Guys is the perfect, incredibly crafted yet laid-back procedural we've been starved for.|Fresh
Shane Black, the buddy action auteur, is back in his wheelhouse-and he's delivered another inspired onscreen pairing in the blundering one-two punch of Gosling and Crowe.|Fresh
Based strictly on performance and a cinematic confidence that borders on arrogance, this is a highly entertaining film...|Fresh
Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, paired up as a goofball detective and hit man, stumble and bicker their way through the funniest roles of their careers.|Fresh
The BFG feels very much like Spielberg's Powell and Pressburger film - it's a picture that could have only been made now, but feels rooted in the past.|Fresh
An innocent pleasure.|Fresh
That the film mostly falls flat has far more to do with the largely unconvincing material rather than with the co-stars, who are more than game ...|Rotten
While their one-liners could be a lot sharper, Crowe and Gosling more than get by on stumblebum amiability.|Fresh
The sort of cheerfully hostile buddy bash that's been a staple since the '80s, only this one is singularly clever about its own triviality, and it offers the scruffy pleasure of seeing two great actors dial down their gravitas with style.|Fresh
