[Suzu] becomes a metaphor for Japan itself, stopped in its tracks before finding the strength to rebuild.|Fresh
I found the plot slow and while sometimes I can get through that, the character arcs weren't there either to really draw me back in.|Rotten
The way we manage our disposition toward unremarkable life and the way conditions change over time can be subtle, but they're important. In This Corner of the World endeavors to showcase that.|Fresh
A Japanese anime film about a young woman's daily life in a town near Hiroshima during World War II.|Fresh
The animation is lovely, often incorporating Suzu's sketches, painting and visualizations, including a genre-breaking sequence toward the end that in its simplicity delivers both a visual and emotional shock.|Fresh
This is not an animated movie for young children. There will be loads of those in the next few weeks as the school holidays kick in. But In This Corner of the World is remarkable.|Fresh
It has jaw-droppingly gorgeous settings, in which all the buildings are depicted with full accuracy, as are the homes of the peasant families who live on a mountain slope, overlooking the (largely wooden) city.|Fresh
Katabuchi's saga of course lacks the monstrous nature of so much manga, instead telling a very human - if still sweeping - tale with few traces of the fantastic.|Fresh
... a little gem that deserves to find a global audience.|Fresh
It's a celebration of those who continued everyday life over the sound of death knocking on the door.|Fresh

This is a touching look at the daily grind of a family living during a time of war.|Fresh
Perfectly animated, emotionally pure, In This Corner of the World is an outright marvel.|Fresh
It's a profound thing, moving from joy to misery and ending with a statement of certain optimism that survivors can continue to survive.|Fresh
Animation buffs may find it of interest because it is always lovely to look at but others will likely find it well-meaning but a bit of a drag in the end.|Fresh
Like many other anime features, this one isn't exactly for the kids. Then again, it can't be any more detrimental to young minds than something like The Emoji Movie.|Fresh
It builds cumulative power because we spend so much time, day in and day out, with this family. Their story, and their survival, becomes important to us.|Fresh
This middle portion of In This Corner of the World, with its keenly realized depictions of the banal daily drudgery of rural Japanese life during ever-darkening days, is downright Ozu-esque but certainly never less than fascinating.|Fresh
We know where In This Corner of the World is headed. But it's easy to forget.|Fresh
Haunting, award worthy, anime evocation of life before and shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima.|Fresh
The animated In This Corner of the World follows a Japanese girl's coming of age in Hiroshima during World War II, and is often beautifully animated and deeply sad.|Fresh
The film is somehow both comfortable and disquieting -- haunting but hopeful -- in its depiction of ordinary lives trapped in an unseen march toward a terrible event.|Fresh
Katabuchi's distinct method in bringing the protagonist's free-floating, over-imaginative thoughts to life through animation help turn In This Corner of the World into an empathetic and colourful picture.|Fresh
[In This Corner of the World] is a beautiful slice of life that feels at once completely relatable and wholly alien, in the best possible way.|Fresh
Fascinating and frustrating in equal measures, In This Corner of the World offers a compelling look at life in Japan during and directly after wartime, with a rich female character at the center, but it's also maddeningly choppy.|Fresh
[In This Corner] carries a disquieting streak of immediacy.|Fresh
Lovely, serious, slightly overlong drama about WWII Japan.|Fresh
A timely morality play, indeed, given the dire apocalyptic threats currently being traded between the unhinged leaders of America and North Korea.|Fresh
"Unfortunately, some fumbled melodrama and the thorny issue of nationalism that hung over Hayao Miyazaki's ""The Wind Rises"" compromise the finer impulses in ""In This Corner of the World."""|Fresh
At the close of In This Corner of the World, old feelings mellow with new resolve that the work of humanity must go on.|Fresh
It is a beautiful film with great depth of emotion and draws the viewer in to its subtle grace in telling a simple, poignant story.|Fresh
Suzu's story becomes so deeply personal that when an animated hand waves at the audience at the film's conclusion, we will feel like waving back, like we would to a friend.|Fresh
"""In This Corner of the World"" thrives when it lingers on incidental observations of life in wartime."|Fresh
It would be great if a story about imminent nuclear warfare didn't feel quite so relevant, but this quietly powerful anime gives us reason to hope.|Fresh
"Writer/director Sunao Katabuchi (assistant director of Hayao Miyazaki's ""Kiki's Delivery Service"") adaptation of Fumiyo Kouno's Manga is so achingly human, it recalls the works of Ozu with its poignant family drama and subtle, quiet wit."|Fresh
Sunao Katabuchi displays a vivid, shattering awareness of how domestic routines can spiritually ground one during a time of demoralizing chaos.|Fresh
"""In This Corner of the World"" is 129 minutes, an eternity for an animated film, especially one so wispy in look and so sparing in plot."|Rotten
Perhaps too long in terms of footage, but with a remarkable medium level, the film, of course, will remain in the retina for the courage of an eternal moment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A story of how easily we get use to horror, misery and indignity. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Eye-opening and humanizing, the film focuses not on the Japanese war machine but the innocent peasants who bore the brunt of what their government unleashed.|Fresh
Katabuchi, in what can justly be described as a labor of love, reportedly spent six years researching the history of Hiroshima...|Fresh
The underlying optimism of the story and its quietly courageous protagonist will leave you feeling inspired and deeply moved.|Fresh
Stately, slow but lovely depiction of life in Japan during WWII, with just a smidgen of nationalism and historical revisionism.|Fresh
Falls rather flat whenever it tries to deal with World War II directly, but as a character study of a young Japanese girl in wartime it is often beguiling.|Fresh
A film that stands as much in being one of the movies of the year in general as in a separate landmark in the history of animated cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An effective (and tearjerking) portrait of people who might have lived in pre-War Hiroshima, a city which we still tend to think about only in the terms of its utter destruction.|Fresh
Even with simpler drawings, writer-director Sunao Katabuchi - who helmed feminist fairy tale anime Princess Arete (2001) - convincingly conveys what life was like in wartime Japan for ordinary folk.|Fresh
Like one of Suzu's artistic sketches, In This Corner of the World is a beautiful and compelling portrait of real life, and despite its harsh portrayal of the realities of war it's a story in which hope remains paramount.|Fresh
Offers an initially gentle take on the lot of a young housewife living in a Japanese naval town in the 1930s, but does so with the hindsight that future events in nearby Hiroshima will greatly impact on her life.|Fresh
Director and writer Sunao Katabuchi brings us a profound and overwhelming tale that is nothing short of heartbreakingly beautiful.|Fresh
The imagery in this gorgeous Japanese animation is delicate and whimsical, but its plot is increasingly hard and cruel.|Fresh
An exquisite portrait of Hiroshima before the bomb that conjures a powerful sense of what - and who - was lost.|Fresh
Set in and near Hiroshima during the second world war, this gentle but slightly unfocused anime looks at Japan through the eyes of an 18-year-old girl.|Fresh
"The quietly revealing tale from the director Sunao Katabuchi follows the childhood and arranged marriage of Suzu, an ""ordinary"", but utterly resilient girl, who also has a talent for drawing."|Fresh
A gorgeously rendered and deeply personal portrayal of a young woman's life in the part of the world where history's greatest conflict reached a devastating conclusion.|Fresh
If there's a message to this film, it's the often unrecognised forbearance and perseverance of women, and the idea that unlike men, they can put love over pride and nationalism.|Fresh
A film that tells an intimate story of struggle and family values before the ravages of war. Definitely a masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A wistfully nostalgic time capsule of civilian life under the catastrophic tide of war.|Fresh
Offers inspirational role models for today's Japan.|Fresh
The crowd-funded film's many charms spring as much from its tone of sorrow as from its lingering hope, ensuring the quiet, patient feature has a sizeable impact.|Fresh
Confronting the horrors of history head-on can make for cinema that's impossible to shake, but Katabuchi's painterly, introspective film proves a sideways approach can be just as indelible.|Fresh
