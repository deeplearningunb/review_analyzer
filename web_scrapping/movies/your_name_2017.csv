Your Name is Makoto Shinkai's most satisfying and complete film to date thanks to its amazingly beautiful animation, a fun yet familiar sci-fi premise, a great melding of genres (sci-fi, romance and disaster movie?) and great vocal talent.|Fresh
Your Name is a beautiful Japanese animation fantasy with an other-worldly feel.|Fresh
Even with its over-elaborate nature and the syrupy resolution, Your Name is really fun to watch, and takes more risks than I would have expected it to.|Fresh
Your Name is [a] mixed bag of bravura style and exhausting storytelling... Despite these reservations, it's clear that Shinkai has created a singularly manic vision that dares to challenge what it means to remember.|Fresh
The script far exceeds expectations... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The hand-painted animation is stunning, from comets streaking across the night sky to an afternoon walk through fall foliage that is breathtaking.|Fresh
...feels something like Charlie Kaufman anime.|Fresh
Your Name may throw to many ideas at the wall, but it's an inventive, pristinely animated, emotionally resonant treat that reinforces Shinkai's undeniable talents.|Fresh
The vital second half feels ponderous and over-blown, and the eventual explanation too complex for its own good.|Rotten
The absolute very best kind of crowdpleaser, the kind that genuinely does seem to have a little something for everyone.|Fresh

Your Name is one of the best film of the year, both animated and live action. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is about as good as it gets.|Fresh
It begins as a hilarious but conventional teen comedy to transform, little by little, into something much more unpredictable and intelligent. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An overwhelming visual symphony of sustained beauty. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A brilliant science fiction story for devotees of traditional anime. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Your Name is a sad movie. It has a happy ending and there are funny moments, but it's sad. It's heartbreaking. It's absolutely devastating.|Fresh
I left the theater feeling as if I had just woken from a beautiful, indescribable dream, desperately fighting to keep it from fading from memory.|Fresh
Beautifully animated (we're talking Studio Ghibli standards here), Your Name captures that sensation of waking up from a dream you wish lasted longer, or misplacing a name that's still warm on your tongue, but has just departed.|Fresh
Your Name. is an engaging if saccharine universal tale of self-discovery. It's also a visual masterwork.|Fresh
It's the rare work of art that can base an extraordinarily powerful moment of emotional catharsis on compulsive boob-squeezing, but that's the miracle of this movie.|Fresh
Your Name. is a treasure that -- even if the first half hour felt confusing to my own Western-educated mind -- is well worth the investment of a near-two-hour view.|Fresh
My suggestion is to refuse to let the story get in the way of enjoying the story. Relish the overreach of a mighty talented writer-director-etc.|Fresh
What separates Your Name from other body swapping movies is its sensitive handling of gender roles, identity, fate, and other lingering themes teens grapple with on a regular basis.|Fresh
You have to see this movie on the big screen if at all possible. There's a 2001 Space Gate-esque sequence that had me in full hand-to-my-heart mode.|Fresh
An anime body-switch comedy that evolves into a surprisingly moving, edge-of-your-seat thriller.|Fresh
By the time Your Name reaches its moving finale, the Next Big Thing tag doesn't seem quite enough for Shinkai. He's arrived already.|Fresh
An honest film in its intentions that will enchant those who aren't ashamed of their incombustible teenage heart. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
By the time Your Name reaches its final half-hour or so, the film has moved so far beyond its initial premise that if you think back to the beginning, you'll be astonished by how far it's come.|Fresh
Stunning but mature animated body-swapping love story.|Fresh
A male and a female teenager are ... switching bodies Freaky Friday-style. Far from a gimmick, this plot point is used to explore issues of gender and culture in a unique way.|Fresh
Good things comes to those who wait, and by the time Your Name's meet-cute moment happens you'll already be in love with the film.|Fresh
Blissfully psychedelic at times with magnetic chemistry between two characters you become completely invested in, Your Name is an anime film unlike any other and is so fantastic that you have to witness all of its beauty and elegance for yourself.|Fresh
Stunning. A masterpiece.|Fresh
A film that will make you laugh, cry and will make your day happier. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Your Name is a remarkably bland title for a pretty interesting movie, but Shinkai's effort - based on his own original novel - is a curious blend of two complex genres that elevates both.|Fresh
... the visuals are positively mind blowing, demonstrating some of the finest artistry to come out of the genre.|Fresh
Your Name is the kind of film that's all the more striking for how easily it could have gone awry, but Shinkai has accomplished something unique and genuinely special here.|Fresh
Shinkai creates a gorgeous, richly detailed look at two sides of Japan... Shinkai's gift for melding these two Japans into a single, luminous story is what gives Your Name its exquisite tension.|Fresh
Shinkai's films speak directly to the times in which they were created, and with this latest work, he has more than earned the right to step from out of the shadow of comparisons to Miyazaki and forge his own name.|Fresh
A mature, contemplative, and deeply satisfying work.|Fresh
The movie is incredible and you will likely agree with me once you see it.|Fresh
It's thoroughly charming and gently comic and, if Mr. Shinkai finally plays it safe about what it means for an adolescent boy and girl to trade bodies and lightly toy with gender, he complicates the story in other ways.|Fresh
Your Name is a stirring tale of rescue with a boisterous edge of YA mischief. It's also a love story with a swoony romantic affinity for the age-old tussle between chance and fate.|Fresh
A gorgeous animated film from director Makoto Shinkai, Your Name is a sweet combination of na√Øve romantic sentimentality and thought-provoking science-fiction.|Fresh
Your Name is a beautifully crafted story of love, loss, desperation and hope brought to the screen with visual splendor.|Fresh
If Your Name isn't quite as revolutionary as it seems to promise, it does herald an important and distinctive new voice that uses anime to address some grown-up - or at least partially grown-up - themes.|Fresh
Your Name takes an unexpected turn, and what a turn it is. It transcends the mundane, and becomes more emotionally compelling than any animated movie you've seen since Inside Out.|Fresh
Your Name stands as a testament to just how effective of a medium animation is when it comes to telling a story of deep emotion and lush symbolism.|Fresh
"""Your Name"" is still highly watchable, even when this mystical Young Adult love story cloys - or confounds."|Fresh
The movie's spirit is by turns energetic and serene, impetuous and wise, its wild shifts from comedy to tragedy to romance revealing themselves not as tonal swings so much as variations in a larger cosmic pattern.|Fresh
It's only barely a romance, bypassing much of that familiar territory to explore something much more intimate and strange.|Fresh
Unforgettable; to miss 'Your Name' is inexcusable.|Fresh
A beautiful, captivating piece of work that gets off to kind of a rocky start but achieves remarkable momentum toward an emotional, powerful ending.|Fresh
The way Masashi depicts wind blowing through grass or a falling star illuminating the sky makes any dream, however convoluted, seem real.|Fresh
A story that touches on themes of destiny and longing, with a romance that is both epic and intimate.|Fresh
"As pleasing as some aspects of ""Your Name"" can be, there's no question Shinkai's overstuffed movie often trips over itself."|Rotten
"One can see the influence of Hiyao Miyazaki here - this is way more ""Spirited Away"" than ""Ghost in the Shell"" - but Shinkai also goes off into his own, weird direction."|Fresh
Even at its most baffling, Your Name maintains a visual style that approaches the grandeur of anime masters like Hayao Miyazaki.|Fresh
With smart, romantic, character-driven fare that feels more like a live-action piece captured as art, the sparkling, brilliant Your Name shows Director Makoto Shinkai is staking his own place in the pantheon of great animators.|Fresh
Its success is a testament to its visual, emotional, and intellectual excellence.|Fresh
"As well as being a wonderful visual and emotional experience, it's a reminder that ""universal"" stories don't need to be generic, but instead thrive on specificity."|Fresh
Your Name is the most beautiful anime since Patema Inverted, with which it shares themes about the difficulties of personal connections as represented by inexplicable cosmic phenomena.|Fresh
Even at its most outrageously bizarre, Your Name is bound together by a passionately romantic core.|Fresh
An original film that captivates with its apparent simplicitybecause of its curious premise and then it doesn't stop surprising. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What starts with a brightly coloured pop leaves behind a powder trail of loveliness.|Fresh
Makoto Shinkai's anime stunner deserves its unexpected Oscar buzz.|Fresh
The animation, every frame exquisitely composed, is as stunning as the storytelling.|Fresh
The animation is spectacular, the characters are wonderfully realized, and the seamless combination of humor and drama is delightfully refreshing.|Fresh
Though the film suffers a bit from its disparate themes, the animation is absolutely gorgeous and the story will grab your heart and squeeze.|Fresh
Grippingly unpredictable and affectingly sentimental, Your Name is ultimately one of the most satisfying animated films of the year.|Fresh
Nobody does star-crossed puppy love like Shinkai.|Fresh
Shinkai unfolds this carefully-plotted origami of a story in a way that's mightily impressive and immensely satisfying to watch.|Fresh
Your Name is a cluster of films all intertwined -- teen comedy, rural drama, and that comet passing by overhead can't be good either -- and Shinkai's energetic style and vivid backgrounds make it a constant delight to watch.|Fresh
Do not miss it if you hold any affection for high-quality, lasting-impact Japanese animation.|Fresh
Part teen rom-com, part sci-fi contemplation of weighty concepts, the anarchy and confusion of life has rarely felt so vivid, honest or enchanting.|Fresh
...an original, beautifully conceived idea...|Fresh
Shinkai is one to watch but doesn't quite yet deserve to be a household name.|Fresh
"Teen audiences in search of a ""relatable"" love story will find this every bit as accessible as Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, while older viewers will delight in the way that archaic arts have become an integral part of 21st-century cinema."|Fresh
Shinkai's effervescent young protagonists shine just as much as the glistening background details of every composition.|Fresh
As the film swings back and forth between mountain shrines and Shinjuku Station, it eloquently and elegantly expresses not only teen confusion but also the tensions between old and new Japan.|Fresh
At least it's ambitious, even if it doesn't quite nail it on the cogent entertainment front.|Fresh
We get nice moments and cute characters (there's a thesis to be written on adorable younger sisters in recent Japanese cinema), but scrambled storytelling and only fitful emotional heft.|Rotten
The film soon blossoms from a body-swap comedy into something magical and profound.|Fresh
Your Name exploits anime's limitless potential to tell a poignant love story that incorporates gender identity and cosmic wormholes to dazzling narrative effect.|Fresh
Body-swap movies such as Freaky Friday always make for good comedy, but Your Name, a gorgeous young-adult animation from Japan, takes the concept into more delicate, dreamlike territory.|Fresh
Although you need to keep your wits about you here, Your Name is a sharply animated, well-told fantastical tale for tweenagers.|Fresh
This mind-bending Japanese animated film is very ingeniously scripted and works in multiple dimensions.|Fresh
An unmissable treat for animation fans.|Fresh
Nice enough - just not quite the knockout advance word promised.|Fresh
For animation fanciers new to Shinkai, it could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship.|Fresh
Part body-swap comedy, part long-distance romance, part... something else. If you only see one Japanese animated feature this year, see this one, and see it more than once.|Fresh
Your Name offers audiences intellect, wonder and tears in equal measure.|Fresh
What a thing of beauty this film is.|Fresh
Something like Your Name -- and rewatching the Ghibli films -- reminds us that the full potential of animated film to broaden the boundaries of human perception lies elsewhere.|Fresh
One of the most poignant responses to a natural catastrophe that Japanese cinema has offered in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.|Fresh
Like a landscape shining after heavy rain, it feels like real life with the sharpness, brightness and sensation turned right up.|Fresh
First-rate Japanese anime is a taste that anyone can acquire in the time it takes to watch a film like this, and it should confirm Shinkai's reputation to genre-lovers around the world, who know his poetry-inspired The Garden of Words.|Fresh
There is humour, romance, excitement, poignancy and a gentle rumination on time through the Japanese tradition of braiding cords. The animation is lovely, beautifully drawn and vividly coloured.|Fresh
A stirring, astonishing and sometimes befuddling joy from start to finish.|Fresh
This vividly realized and emotionally satisfying feature ought to make Shinkai a household name - certainly in Japan, and with any luck, in other countries as well.|Fresh
"Something remains -- a memory, however faint, of paradise. ""Your Name."" gets that something, a blend of aching pathos and glimmer of unearthly beauty, memorably right."|Fresh
