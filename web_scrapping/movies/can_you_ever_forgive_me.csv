Can You Ever Forgive Me showcases Heller's flare for giving voice to women characters who express dangerousness and intensity through blunt humour.|Fresh
A bland biography that doesn't do much but serve as a showcase for its two main stars. Lee Israel deserved better even if she was convicted. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
Heller's expeditious direction and consistent storytelling potentiate both the gravitas and the titillation of an amusing biopic.|Fresh
Hell, make a few more like this, Melissa, and you might be forgiven.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? balances comedy and crime expertly and McCarthy's pathetic yet relatable performance as Lee Israel is a career-best.|Fresh
Shot in drab browns and greys that evoke the mustiness of Lee's closed-off life, this dramedy is nevertheless textured and complex, thoughtfully addressing age, connection and legacy.|Fresh
McCarthy, let loose on a dramatic role, is astonishingly good.|Fresh
Lee Israel has stumbled on one of the few lucrative careers in writing, so it's a pity it's illegal. McCarthy ensures we root for the unlikeable Lee from the off. Grant is superb, slowly peeling off the layers to find Jack hiding from himself.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me may not be the movie everyone expects Melissa McCarthy to make, but it is the one in which she shines.|Fresh
Melissa McCarthy as Lee Israel transforms from comedy queen to dramatic actress. McCarthy is gifted. Period. Richard E. Grant as Israel's partner in crime (literally) Jack Hock is charming and never delivers a dull moment.|Fresh
McCarthy and Grant give the performances of their lives in a fascinating literary crime saga that blends caustic wit and pathos with aplomb.|Fresh
Heller delicately balances whip-smart acerbic wit and tragedy, as we are plunged into the inner life of a troubled writer... a melancholic, smart, cautionary tale.|Fresh
This film takes an altogether different view of the imitation game. By embracing frauds and failures, it achieves greatness on the sly.|Fresh
Getting audiences to side with an essentially unlikeable and morally dubious character is no mean feat, but when it works it really works and that is the power of Can You Ever Forgive Me?|Fresh
Whippet thin, cigarette holder clamped between his teeth, fedora pulled down over his eyes, [Grant] steals the movie the same way Hock filches dollars from Lee's haul of cash.|Fresh
It's a fairly standard biopic heightened by an unflinching lead performance.|Fresh
A delve into bitterness, loneliness, and self-destructive tendencies, yet told with a big booming heart.|Fresh
As for McCarthy, her performance is less of a revelation than a confirmation of her talents.|Fresh
It's a classic odd-couple comedy with some real pathos hidden between the quips.|Fresh
Perfectly cast.|Fresh
Israel is anti-social and aggressive but you do find yourself rooting for her.|Fresh
It's a sad, sometimes funny, always intriguing tale, an extreme example of the way biographers can live their subjects' lives vicariously.|Fresh
The revelation of McCarthy's turn is that she's just allowed to be, without apology, without schmaltz.|Fresh
[McCarthy's] Lee demands our pity and attention - and you hate yourself for liking such a fundamentally horrible person.|Fresh
I can never understand why people are so amazed when comic actors turn out to be good straight ones, but Melissa McCarthy is so good in this funny, moving, true story that a career shift may ensue.|Fresh
The film, directed with unobtrusive sharpness by Marielle Heller, revels in the low-tech minutiae of Israel's increasingly elaborate criminal enterprise.|Fresh
Now here's an absolute treat.|Fresh
It doesn't hammer anything home. There is no heavy-handed exposition, no back stories. The characters arrive as is.|Fresh
It's a great New York movie. It's a great film about friendship. It's also a great cat movie (if that's your bag).|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? is the buddy comedy nobody knew they wanted. It is charming, understated and in parts utterly heartbreaking.|Fresh
Every beat of the film is just so, its portraiture as rich as the characters themselves are barely solvent.|Fresh
We can't believe the two got away with it for so long. But simultaneously we will them on.|Fresh
The screenplay by Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty is well structured, witty and poignant. The funniest moments tend to be the most painful or humiliating ones.|Fresh
"For what could have been a sordid and interior little yarn, ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" positively glows."|Fresh
A poignant and tender caper that doesn't sugar-coat its protagonists with redemptive Hollywood schmaltz, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a dirty martini of a movie you'll want to savour.|Fresh
McCarthy is very good at showing how Lee's unpleasant bad temper and rudeness were not simply part of her psychological makeup: they were symptoms of existential panic.|Fresh
A film that's difficult to fault: funny, sad and smarter than a Dorothy Parker put-down.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? resonates as a historical snapshot as well as de-glamorization of the most misrepresented profession in cinema.|Fresh
Everything - performance, script, direction, cinematography - works in perfect concert.|Fresh
Deviously funny and deeply moving.|Fresh
A moving hymn to outsiders, this thrives on two criminally good performances from Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant. It also confirms Marielle Heller as one of the brightest directorial talents around.|Fresh
Heller may only have two movies to her name, however she's a perceptive, probing and generous director, giving her characters the space they need to shine and fail and experience everything in-between.|Fresh
Heller's tight direction is wonderful with every aspect combining to deliver a superb movie - and McCarthy and Grant together are pure, majestic dynamite.|Fresh
Grant injects a mix of charmer and rotter into Jack's hustling, but it's McCarthy's prickly, vulnerable and bravely egotistical Lee who seals the film's deal.|Fresh
Director Marielle Heller offers a heartfelt and subtly devastating true story of loneliness and desperation.|Fresh

Easily one of the best film's of the year, Marielle Heller's Can You Ever Forgive Me? sports career-best performances from Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant in a tender, biting, funny story about middle-aged failure and bitterness.|Fresh
Don't miss this astonishing story.|Fresh
The movie's seemingly credible re-creation of 1990s New York as a place of dark, inviting bars and even darker and more inviting used bookstores represents at least one idea of paradise.|Fresh
Heller does do a fine job of showing the physicality of Israel's morally dubious work.|Fresh
McCarthy throws herself into this true story taking us for a ride, even as the character pushes away everyone in her life and makes many questionable choices. The script is wonderful, but the director and DP didn't match the level of artistry.|Fresh
The kind of thing that just works, without flash or ingenuity, but strong in snugly-fitted craftsmanship.|Fresh
McCarthy isn't often given roles that showcase her serious acting chops but when she is, she always hits a home run.|Fresh
Audiences are likely form different opinions about Lee Israel but hopefully they can all agree that this is one of the year's best films.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a solid portrait of a talented writer who lost sight of herself in the words of others.|Fresh
Melancholic, indeed dour, with a colour palette of (too much) brown and grey ... Luckily, the film has a few joltingly interesting twists and turns, and Richard E. Grant, who is, has been and always will be joltingly interesting.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a true story that is too good to be true, a precious literary footnote that captures precisely the poisonous nature of unfulfilled ambition and squandered potential.|Fresh
Some may be surprised by the depth of McCarthy's work here, but this really shouldn't be surprising. In her best comedic creations, the actress can deliver a single line that all at once makes you guffaw, scratch your head, wince and feel pathos.|Fresh
However, the film belong to both Grant and McCarthy. His performance and character remind one of his seminal 1987 black comedy Withnail and I.... while she is a revelation.|Fresh
This is a story about mean and unpleasant people, and it stays that way right to the end - and is all the better for it.|Fresh
McCarthy clearly feels a connection to Israel's outsider artistry, her utter commitment to become someone else for a few stolen moments, and her pride in a job well done...|Fresh
A moving, compelling portrait...Melissa McCarthy and director Marielle Heller have fashioned a gem of a film around a person who was anything but a gem of a person. One can feel the Oscars beckon.|Fresh
While Grant is lovely (he always is), this is most surprising due to McCarthy, who hasn't been this good in about 10 years,.|Fresh
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? is a misguided and, frankly, a dull attempt at framing an undesirable character.|Rotten
The achievement shared by McCarthy and Heller is to make us understand this woman and, furthermore, to make us care about her.|Fresh
Melissa McCarthy gives a brilliantly calibrated performance that should see her touted on the awards circuit.|Fresh
Under the consummate direction of Marielle Heller... Can You Ever Forgive Me? is funny, poignant, insightful and surprisingly endearing. Especially considering the bleak places it must visit along the way.|Fresh
It's refreshingly unusual, to say the least, for a major studio picture to deliver an empathetic portrait of a bitter, middle-aged lesbian that has little interest in a redemptive character arc.|Fresh
[The] film is a triumph of understatement as well as a moving reflection on the many ways people shut themselves off from a world that seems to have closed its doors to them.|Fresh
This is a neat little film bringing to light Israel's fascinating story, with excellent performances making it an enjoyable literary romp.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? is an instantly iconic NYC flick, though this one is centered on two queer characters, giving us more diverse subjects than in Woody Allen's entire canon.|Fresh

McCarthy is a powerhouse who isn't afraid to teeter between being deeply sympathetic and completely repellent. It's a performance that brings out the essential ambivalence that Israel, as written, feels about herself.|Fresh
A little slow at times, but scenes were then able to perk me right back up. For these two performances, this is something you should see.|Fresh
It's not a flat movie, by any stretch of the imagination but it's not bubbly...they all work together well...|Fresh
It's a heartbreaker of a performance.|Fresh
"""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" combines elements of a caper thriller, smart New York comedy and sobering drama, with a revelatory performance by McCarthy as the delightfully dyspeptic Israel."|Fresh
It's a great story (true of course) and the idea of a renegade biographer with a religion of caustic wit embellishing letters of famous literary figures in line with their personalities, is irresistible.|Fresh
Mischievous and darkly compelling. McCarthy's penetrating performance as a flawed feminine wonder corrosively stuck in her ambitious misdeeds in the name of artistic rejection is an absolute revelation. McCarthy is in redemptive mode with a knockout turn|Fresh
That McCarthy plays Israel with the fearful distrust of an abused dog creates a distinct relationship between viewer and subject: she's a protagonist that begs to be sympathized with but doesn't command it.|Fresh
Melissa McCarthy gives the performance of her career and Richard E. Grant is terrific. Director Marielle Heller has a keen eye for detail from the bookshops to the bars, the film is bathed in authenticity.|Fresh
Their shared air of bristling odium and the vaudeville of dipsomania supply two of the most memorable malcontents in an age.|Fresh
A fascinating portrait of a flawed person driven to do a bad thing, and kind of not feeling sorry about it.|Fresh
This is the sort of screen magic that can't be faked. Miss it and, mark my words, you'll never forgive yourself.|Fresh
And McCarthy's curmudgeonly Lee and Grant's fizzy Jack make a delicious odd couple.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? is about how gifts are never just gifts. It's about mental illness and loneliness. It's about artists and the Buddha's two deadly sins: the need for praise and the fear of criticism. It's really good.|Fresh

A superb tragicomic performance, cannily nuanced and vanity free.|Fresh

McCarthy's performance notwithstanding, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a modest film... It's also effortlessly entertaining.|Fresh
I'm not sure that there's any great moral to be drawn from all this, but Can You Ever Forgive Me? entertains right up until an end that suggests that Israel's reformation retained trace elements of defiance. Refreshing.|Fresh
It's a solid movie that never quite becomes a thought-provoking one.|Fresh
... seamlessly intertwines the story of its unscrupulous protagonist with a nostalgic tribute to a bygone literary age.|Fresh

Melissa McCarthy convincingly transforms into a woman with all rough edges in this comedy about a literary forger that's black as pitch.|Fresh
As Lee, McCarthy offers a committed, slightly corny case for the dramatic viability of her post-Bridesmaids superstardom.|Fresh
It would be a cautionary tale if it wasn't also damnably sentimental in the peculiar vein of media accounts that seek to justify the behavior of a particular professional class and its favored types.|Rotten

Marielle Heller's second feature film is, like her first, filled with complex and intriguing characters who are presented to us as just that.|Fresh

"McCarthy proves her incredible range once again, this time carrying Israel's deadpan misery of being a ""horrible ***t"" as she is described, bravely."|Fresh
While it never quite finds enough of a voice to be considered a must see, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is often as compelling as the fake letters Isreal wrote for her victims.|Fresh

I have to admit the subtlety and fullness of her performance in this film did hit me as a shock to the system.|Fresh

The performances are what make the movie worth seeing. Every one of them is a gem.|Fresh
McCarthy is a mighty convincing curmudgeon.|Fresh

There's more to Lee than her personality and her crimes, but McCarthy, the screenplay, and director Marielle Heller never try to turn the character into someone she is not.|Fresh

The one thing this film can't do is give us a reason to like Lee Israel.|Fresh
McCarthy's interpretation is a detailed study of how fear becomes the force that paralyzes the professional growth of this writer and at the same time the fuel that pushes her to move forward. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

McCarthy is excellent... It's a dark performance that's still hilarious, as Lee refuses to tone down her cynicism for anyone.|Fresh
McCarthy and Grant give awards-worthy performances under Marielle Heller in this superbly entertaining rumination on what constitutes art... and how to make a buck in desperate times.|Fresh
Heller delivers a solid movie with fantastic acting, creativity and engagement.|Fresh
"Paul Simon's percolating, anxious ""Can't Run But"" dominates the movie's soundtrack, and no number of scenes shot in Julius's warm bar, the whiskey flowing, can shake that restless mood. It's atmosphere brewed to an expert degree of exactitude."|Fresh

With a career-best performance from Melissa McCarthy, 'Can You Ever Forgive Me?' is one of the year's biggest surprise packages.|Fresh
"""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" is a breakthrough for McCarthy and a highlight of the movie year."|Fresh
Marielle Heller has once again constructed a fascinating character portrait that requires multiple viewings to truly appreciate the depth of its central figure. As for Melissa McCarthy, well, I forgive you for The Happytime Murders and then some|Fresh

Melissa McCarthy is virtually unrecognizable while portraying New York writer-turned-forger Lee Israel in Can You Ever Forgive Me?|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? is the film we've all been waiting for from McCarthy, and the quality and the wait is well worth forgiving for.|Fresh
McCarthy's portrayal of Israel as a slovenly, hard-drinking misanthrope who has only her ailing black and white cat for company is far more touching than it ought to be, considering the protagonist's hair-trigger setting of venomous hostility.|Fresh
Who would have believed a film about an acerbic misanthrope, played by an actress known for her raucous comedies, could be so moving, intimate and ultimately sublime?|Fresh
A dual showcase for colorful, albeit reclusive, late author Lee Israel and for Melissa McCarthy, who disappears into her potentially career-redefining dramatic role.|Fresh
McCarthy and Grant are two peas in a pod, sensationally committed and ruthlessly dedicated, and should be the full worth of an admission ticket.|Fresh
It's likely that the draw for many will be the woman who gets top billing, and rightly so, but she's blessed with a fascinating role to play, and a hell of a story to tell.|Fresh
This is a true vintage New York writer's movie in the best sense.|Fresh

Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant give Oscar worthy performances in this beautifully realized true story about author Lee Israel who forged celebrity letters and lived to write about it.|Fresh
The sophisticated story coscripted by Nicole Holofcener... merits the Oscar nomination it is likely to get for best adapted screenplay.|Fresh
For the most part, this is a nicely sharp character comedy that openly admires Israel's intelligence and resourcefulness and relishes the ingenuity of her multiple vintage typewriters and her hunts for the perfect paper.|Fresh
Melissa's McCarthy playing Lee Israel is no forgery, it's the real thing. She gives a powerhouse, poignant, weaved in with her comedic caustic wit, award deserving performance.|Fresh
Much like its protagonist, the film's occasional missteps in its attempts at survival are, well, easy enough to forgive.|Fresh

Melissa McCarthy gives one of her best performances in a surprisingly relatable story about a criminal misanthrope with a heart beating deep inside her.|Fresh
The fact that the film is all the more compelling for its lack of traditional action is down to Heller's skilfull directing, and the script, which crackles with Lee and Jack's combined wit.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? is truly a tribute to the complexity, depth and bittersweet hues of humanity, as understood from the position of two older, queer people.|Fresh
[McCarthy] completely disappears into the character and personality of Lee Israel-age, stringy masculine hair, sardonic grimace, reading glasses and all-with a range I never dreamed possible.|Fresh
It is a fiercely composed, historically informed, and richly textured film, as insightful regarding the particularities of the protagonist as it is on the artistic life-and on the life of its times.|Fresh
An impressive showcase for McCarthy, giving her a role that tests her dramatic chops without being humor-free, and that puts her in a precarious situation of her own making without ever turning maudlin about it.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? captures the clumsiness of the human heart.|Fresh
Although the title begs forgiveness, it's laced with a sense of Israel's signature biting sarcasm. Can you forgive her for trying? Can you forgive her for surviving? The real question is: Can she ever forgive us, for underestimating her worth?|Fresh
Believe the Oscar buzz for Melissa McCarthy in this true story of an out-of-work author who took up forgery to pay the bills. McCarthy shows she has what it takes to tackle drama and comedy and all stops in between: the power to amaze.|Fresh
No one does dissolute hubris with as much charm as Grant, and his ebullience is the perfect foil to the misanthropic McCarthy.|Fresh
It's a bracing thing to watch. Yet [director Marielle] Heller also knows just when to soften her touch; one leaves Can You Ever Forgive Me? feeling more consoled than depressed.|Fresh
Maintaining an audience's sympathy for a character through their most fumbling, frustrating lows requires compassion and clarity of purpose, both of which McCarthy amply demonstrates here.|Fresh
"""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" feels worn and lived in - in a good way - with a world of musty vintage tomes and bar-room desperation given emotional life through McCarthy and a super supporting turn from Richard E. Grant."|Fresh
"""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" demands not our love for this supremely difficult person but rather our respect for her defiance of an unsympathetic world."|Fresh
Partly because the movie is so splendidly and completely absorbed in its characters and their milieu, it communicates much more than a quirky appreciation for old books and odd readers.|Fresh
[McCarthy's] simply one of the best actors working today, and it didn't take a drama to see that. Can You Ever Forgive Me? most sings -- or rather, grumbles spectacularly -- when McCarthy and Grant are together.|Fresh
Grant and McCarthy are well on their way to deserved Academy Award nominations for their full bodied work here.|Fresh
Melissa McCarthy as you've never seen her before: stunning.|Fresh

In Lee, McCarthy has a role that allows her a rare opportunity to demonstrate her dramatic chops and the actress knocks it out of the park.|Fresh

Marielle Heller's Can You Ever Forgive Me? is the rarest of comedies, as lovely as it is scabrous...|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? moves from a potentially self-serving farce to the heartbreaking tale of an artist haunted by alcohol abuse, depression, and poverty.|Fresh
The bulk of the film's success, however, can be traced to Heller. Her direction is lyrical, gently following Israel's movements, aware not of her defects but of her tender loneliness and lack of acknowledgment by the wider world.|Fresh
It's a wicked, witty treat, with Melissa McCarthy playing Israel as an unapologetically unlikable protagonist, and batting around some truly delicious dialogue with Richard E. Grant, as pretty much her only friend.|Fresh
"Heller (""The Diary of A Teenage Girl"") again showing a great knack for visually intimate drama, hasn't even come close to reaching her artistic peak, but you have a sense that it's coming."|Fresh
a captivating film about two unforgivable tricksters who will forge their way into your heart whether you like it or not.|Fresh
Heller's film is like any of the letters that Lee modifies: a miniature that offers enormous pleasures in each line with a fantastic interaction between McCarthy and Richard E. Grant. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

The effortless and captivating rapport between Richard E. Grant and Melissa McCarthy offers deeper pleasures than the main plot of the film.|Fresh
Can You Ever Forgive Me? comes from a place of understanding and love that few other biopics truly dive into, and it makes this difficult character a joy to meet.|Fresh

Can You Ever Forgive Me? is delightful and brings us an alluring true story - far from the fiction that any author can possibly imagine.|Fresh
"""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" is that rare movie you never want to end, a film about broken people, loners who hover on the fringes, who scavenge what's left of the important stuff that more socially competent humans leave behind."|Fresh
Grant and McCarthy have a disreputable chemistry that works like cognac on a winter's night, warming the film from the inside out. It's okay to get drunk on it.|Fresh
A comedy with dark edges and a melancholic center... McCarthy gives a fine-tuned performance, her outsized comic sensibilities channeled into in a non-farcical, three-dimensional character.|Fresh

McCarthy's performance, which is paired with an equally rewarding turn by British actor Richard E. Grant, anchors this bizarre, compelling true story.|Fresh
A little gem of a movie.|Fresh
