It provides laughter, emotion and just the right dose of reality. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Simon is the best gay protagonist that [a] post-Hughes teen comedy could give us. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Love, Simon succeeds best when it's letting its teen characters - particularly these teen characters - sprawl out... The cast is full of promising young performers.|Fresh
The constant wondering, the yearning for a connection, the endless comparing of your own experience to what you're observing, the quest to find someone, anyone who understands what you're going through-Love, Simon nails all of this.|Fresh
The only sad thing about this film is that it has to break taboos in the first place in this increasingly conservative society... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"I've heard this film described as a ""John Hughes"" - type film. Barely. Though Hughes did spend a lot of his time writing about teenagers, their problems and how they dealt with them, his characters were a hell of a lot more believable."|Rotten

A must-see romantic comedy that evokes the late John Hughes but traces its own path of inclusion, maturity and self discovery. -[Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Indeed, this is where Love, Simon succeeds; in telling a small story about how hard it can be to declare who you are and who you want to be.|Fresh
Sweet and moving as it often manages to be, the film is comfortingly average, in its way - the point of it not to stand out, but fit in.|Fresh
The film captures, as do the Hughes films it nakedly wants to be, something pleasantly casual about the rhythms of teenage life.|Fresh

The plot has a few glitches, but generally the film is funny, sweet and thoughtful.|Fresh
It sticks to the rules of its genre, right down to the cloying music and obligatory schmaltzy climax, and uses them to demonstrate a truth that should be obvious: all love stories are essentially the same.|Fresh
"It's highly unlikely you'll read a review of this film that doesn't contain the word ""adorable"". It's equally unlikely that you'll be able to watch it without grinning from ear to ear."|Fresh
The high school teen romcom is reborn for 2018. Funny, sentimental and smart: John Hughes would be proud.|Fresh

It's more like a John Hughes film than a Sundance circuit piece, squarely in the middle, just like Simon. That doesn't make it any less special.|Fresh
A sweetly old-fashioned romance about a young man who falls in love over email... with another young man. Tender, funny, sometimes heartbreaking, enormously human and honest.|Fresh

Accessible and inclusive, this is a major pop-culture breakthrough, offering authentic validation for LGBT teens, worthwhile insights for hetero viewers, and crowd-pleasing entertainment for everyone.|Fresh
Love, Simon is sweet, funny and immensely likeable and should persuade even the hardest heart that everyone deserves a great love story.|Fresh
Robinson is an immensely engaging lead, and Simon's tricky predicament, while rendered rather simplistically at times, rings true.|Fresh
How heartening that a mainstream studio flick could have a gay protagonist. How disappointing that said flick is as twee and anodyne as this.|Rotten
Love, Simon - I really did.|Fresh
Often funny in a decidedly wry and even dark fashion, this isn't sexually explicit but instead proves to be more about the pain and uncertainty of coming-out at a time when people think they're so accepting - but aren't really.|Fresh
Wisely, [Greg] Berlanti leaves A-listers Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel in the background for most of the film and allows his young cast to carry the film in style - even though the ending is all a little too neatly wrapped.|Fresh
An uneven but ultimately winning coming-out story. It's one of those films where I can point out lots of flaws but then of them especially bother me|Fresh
With its sheer warmth, openness, likability and idealism, Love, Simon won me over.|Fresh

Beneath the glossy visuals and the power-pop soundtrack there's something quietly radical about Love, Simon.|Fresh
Pure magic.|Fresh
Teens in my screening laughed at all the right moments, and even applauded at the end|Fresh
Far too many contemporary teen comedies anoint themselves as 'Hughes-ian', desperate to align...with the smart, sweet, insightful teen movies of the genre's golden years, the 80s. Finally, a film earns the accolade.|Fresh
Simon and his friends are likeable kids and their romantic problems are affectionately explored.|Fresh
You'll 'Love, Simon.'|Fresh
Simply by being a typical, if entertaining, high school movie, it may be making its most important statement of all.|Fresh
It's undemanding but immensely likeable.|Fresh
As a sociological milestone, this is not quite in the Black Panther class, but the difference lies only in the size of the film's financial ambitions.|Fresh
Like Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, The Edge of Seventeen and Easy A, Love, Simon is proof that there is still plenty of life, fun and intelligent storytelling to be had in the high school movie genre.|Fresh
While it is not a work that will change the world, Love, Simon will indeed mean the world to any viewers living through the same trials, tribulations and unnecessarily solitary soul-searching as its teen protagonist.|Fresh
By adhering to coming-of-age formula and relying on plot contrivances, it downplays the internal struggles of its closeted protagonist, and thus reduces the emotional impact.|Rotten
Love Simon is up there with your first kiss or first pancake on a Saturday morning; it's not perfect, but it's still sweet as hell.|Fresh
Love, Simon is an earnest coming-of-age story, gentle and generous, with a captivating performance from Nick Robinson as the titular Simon.|Fresh
It's a terrific movie with a great, star-making performance by Nick Robinson.|Fresh
As bland as vanilla pudding. But unless you're completely vanilla-phobic, the movie's unforced good feelings are easy to enjoy.|Fresh

A really effective coming-of-age movie that I adored...this movie can and will connect with anyone who has been searching for love, particularly in high school.|Fresh
... it's good that Love, Simon is as accomplished and likable as it is.|Fresh
Unless you don't buy into Jennifer Garner (from those dreadful 'what's in your wallet?' commercials), portraying a former valedictorian mom, 'Simon' likely will grab you from the get-go.|Fresh
Thanks to a dynamic, emotionally astute script from Berger and Aptaker, that coupled with Berlanti's unobtrusive direction helps make this movie an agreeable revelation I likely couldn't have resisted even if I had wanted to.|Fresh
As a piece of filmmaking craft, it's competent, if unremarkable...if Love, Simon helps even one gay teen come to terms with their sexuality, in the friendly confines of familiar movie formulas, hey, it was probably worth it.|Fresh
While things get a bit Dawson's Creek-y at times, director Greg Berlanti never allows the narrative's melodrama to overtake the more significant themes that make a film like Love, Simon a milestone for mainstream gay movies.|Fresh
An engaging, entertaining and thought-provoking film. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
It's a premise that understands a the key takeaways of the closet, which is that sexuality is a valuable piece of intel. It's also a nice springboard for a few valuable life lessons about friendship and integrity, and a handful of strong performances.|Fresh
A complex balancing act with a perfectly executed payoff that might not have had the same impact without Robinson's heartwarming breakout performance.|Fresh
This particular take on a major studio teen comedy is long overdue, but director Greg Berlanti seems intent on keeping his movie attuned to mainstream sensibilities.|Fresh

Affecting, lovable romcom about gay teen has a little edge.|Fresh
Love, Simon is an adorable addition to the teen movie canon.|Fresh
An overrated John Hughes version of distinctive art house entries Call Me by Your Name and Moonlight.|Fresh
Love, Simon has a few sad moments as Simon's mistakes come crashing down around him, but mostly it's a sweet, funny, warm-hearted film.|Fresh

"...finely tuned situations and sharp dialogue delivered by a thoroughly charming cast that makes this ""Simon"" something special."|Fresh
It's a warm-but-thin rom-com that isn't particularly noteworthy outside of its trailblazing subject matter. Its heart is in the right place, however, which gives it a light stamp of approval.|Fresh
Witty, warm and wise in spite of its contrivances and schmaltz. It's one of the best romantic teen comedies in recent memory. It deserves to become a sleeper hit and a cult classic.|Fresh

As a consumer, it is simply your responsibility to see it, just so that many more Love, Simons can be made.|Fresh
Love, Simon suffers from some of those coming-of-age clichés, but they're certainly worth sitting through in enjoying this journey to adulthood as a whole.|Fresh
Young and old, jocks and nerds, geeks and freaks, and everyone in between should be able to find something to adore in Love, Simon.|Fresh
The movie is enjoyable enough, despite the callow gloss of a 1970s after-school TV special preaching to us about tolerance.|Fresh
"With a slight adjustment for gender, the lyrics of a classic Gershwin song could sum up the plot of ""Love, Simon."""|Fresh
While the romance elements of Love, Simon will earn it headlines and, perhaps more importantly, butts-in-seats, it's the film's quieter, deeper coming-out storyline that forms its true emotional center.|Fresh
The charming and compassionate Love, Simon feels revolutionary.|Fresh
"It is immediately apparent that ""Love, Simon"" is long overdue."|Fresh
...among the best representations of a gay love story depicted on screen.|Fresh
Love, Simon diversifies the canon of gay coming-of-age movies, wherein protagonists are often alienated, and offers an undeniably satisfying, cheesy and often hilarious teen romance.|Fresh
The casting is high quality, the script - with a tantalizing mystery at its heart - is particularly well-crafted and the story hits all the right emotional notes in delivering a funny, warm-hearted and life-affirming tale.|Fresh
The emotional resonance may be surprising given the movie's relentless gloss, but it's real.|Fresh
It really does get better - at the movies anyway.|Fresh
A good-hearted but exceptionally bland 'coming-out-of-age' movie modeled after the John Hughes high school pictures of the eighties.|Rotten
It's undeniably a good thing that it exists, that we have a wide-release movie that treats homosexuality as normal and natural, is about a gay kid, and even directed by a gay man. I just hope that it paves the way for better such movies down the line.|Rotten
"""Love, Simon"" is a sweet, modern romantic comedy that manages to channel the teen movie classics of the late John Hughes, but only the good stuff."|Fresh
Doesn't everybody deserve a great love story?|Fresh
Robinson's Simon is a revelation, his hooded eyes suggesting they see a lot more than they let on, while the charismatic Shipp steals all of her scenes as a student with her own demons.|Fresh
The movie is well-made and likable, without any major missteps. It's also just a little bland.|Fresh
The movie ... speaks to another, more precious kind of privilege, one that straight kids have had since movies began: the right to a romantic fantasy served up like ice cream, tart and sweet.|Fresh

Love, Simon is FANTASTIC, and regardless of whether you've read the book, you should see it IMMEDIATELY.|Fresh
It takes what could have been a teen-movie cliché stacked on top of a coming-out cliché like stale wedding cake and turns them into something that feels fresh, even while not saying anything particularly revelatory.|Fresh
There may be little in this movie that you haven't seen before, but the perspective through which you're seeing it can make all the difference.|Fresh
This kid makes Ferris Bueller look like a dangerous radical.|Rotten
Innocuous. But at this stage of cultural progress on the gay acceptance front, that's not enough.|Rotten
There's plenty to admire here, and any sort of gentleness at the multiplex is something to be treasured, but it's hard to ignore the film's general unwillingness to confront cruelty.|Fresh
"Fortunately, characters like Simon have ""the character"" to make the right choices."|Fresh
"""Love, Simon"" exists on a spectrum between ""Lady Bird"" and ""Mean Girls."" It has the warm winsomeness of ""Lady Bird"" and the crackling humor of ""Mean Girls,"" playing with the high school archetypes that film captured so well."|Fresh

Though it tells an emotional story about identity and coming out, it's an easygoing movie, glossy and kind and cozily corny. And yet, for me, it was also a fraught experience, both pained and giddy, cheering and dismaying. It's a lot, this little movie.|Fresh
This film treats 17-year-old Simon Spier's quest for love and self-acceptance with the tender, timeless, Hollywood touch of John Hughes: It's a classic story of a first crush made groundbreaking by centering on a closeted gay kid.|Fresh

Love, Simon is a funny, heartfelt, and truly touching teen romantic comedy that instantly becomes a modern classic for today's generation.|Fresh
"""Love, Simon"" never feels like it exists merely because it should; its endearing charm makes it a film that viewers will watch regardless of its valuable social impact."|Fresh
But Love, Simon's greatest triumph is that it manages to highlight the small ways in which even the most accepting and open-minded among us can make coming out difficult, even in 2018.|Fresh
The film focuses on the one thing it does differently... and it can't be denied that it does make the tired formula feel ever so slightly fresh for having done so.|Fresh
From a romantic standpoint, the most beautiful aspect of Love, Simon is that through nothing but emails it's believable that these two students could fall for one another; it's not about physical appearances or social status or anything superficial|Fresh
Greg Berlanti's charmingly heartfelt film is a remarkably successful attempt to give shape to the experience of the closet by drawing an incredibly intimate portrait of a teenage boy about to leave it behind.|Fresh
Love, Simon is touching as a gesture. As entertainment, it's nothing Degrassi hasn't done better.|Rotten
It's too bad that the movie isn't as vibrant, funny, and entertaining as the community it wishes to represent - but it's a start.|Fresh
Love, Simon won't be short of critics (and many of them will be adamant that its story is either unimportant or, gasp, amoral) but within its sleek studio skeleton, there's genuine heart.|Fresh
"At a cultural moment when it matters so much for audiences to see themselves represented on screen, ""Love, Simon"" broadens the spectrum to include those who are questioning their sexuality."|Fresh
It's an expertly carved chunk of cheese. But taken on its own, limited terms, Love, Simon is also a charmer - warm, often funny and gently touching, tickling rather than pummeling your tear ducts.|Fresh
Not only would this make John Hughes stand up and cheer, its honesty and tenderness are destined to leave a lasting legacy.|Fresh
