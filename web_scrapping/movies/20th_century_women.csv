When people lament the loss of mid-budget films celebrating real people, they should hold this film up as a champion of the type of story that is both small and universal, where nothing and everything happens.|Fresh
20th Century Women is one of the finest films of the year, unceremoniously buried in an awards season full of biopics and more overtly emotive dramas.|Fresh
The script, also from Mills, borders on braggadocio at times. Like Abbie, it's all a touch too smug, a hint too clever, a punch too superior.|Fresh
It doesn't always hit the lofty mark it clearly aspires to hit, but it is held together by one contant -- Annette Bening.|Fresh
20th Century Women is an absolute delight of a movie, one that wraps you into this little corner of life in tumultuous time of transition in America while exploring its themes of masculinity through a feminist lens.|Fresh
Like a crisply-woven novella, it gives you breadth and range in a short amount of time so that, when finished, the story sighs with the memories of these beautifully-sketched characters.|Fresh
Heartwarmingly hysterical with a great screenplay and all round performances across the board.|Fresh
An able, well-chosen cast take on the challenge of this delicate, character-driven story with highly individual performances which nevertheless mesh perfectly.|Fresh
Each woman gets her portrait painted in the course of the film, from youth to adulthood, and Mills is generous and unjudging in these scenes.|Fresh
The absorbing, entertaining and moving ensemble family drama 20th Century Women set in California in 1979 stars Annette Bening in a career topping performance as matriarch of a diverse family brought together by blood and love.|Fresh

The absorbing, entertaining and moving ensemble family drama 20th Century Women set in California in 1979 stars Annette Bening in a career topping performance as matriarch of a diverse family brought together by blood and love.|Fresh
This is a novelistic movie in its structure, as characters reach into their pasts and even describe their futures, stretching the film's perfectly rendered moments in both directions.|Fresh
Sentimental on paper, 20th Century Women's central conceit is executed with grace and wit. The characters orbit each other at just the right moment, influencing and shattering preconceptions about identity, personality and desire.|Fresh
It's easy to see why [Annette Bening] was nominated for her performance during the 2017 awards season.|Fresh
Despite its modest trappings, 20th Century Women reveals itself to be a surprisingly ambitious, freewheeling exploration of a precipice moment.|Fresh
By sheer repetition, 20th Century Women becomes Dorothea's coming of age story 40 years late. Mills' movie is ultimately as aimless as her life has been, messy and marked by fleeting pleasures but not enough.|Rotten
It's a warm, wise and funny movie that is heartwarming without being sappy.|Fresh
Annette Bening doesn't get as many leading roles as she should. Part of this may be the lack of roles for older women overall. Or, it may be that she holds out for interesting, dimensional characters.|Fresh
Mill's script is very solid...|Fresh
The result is a low-key, beautifully acted if somewhat angst-ridden delight, as you might expect from writer-director Mike Mills.|Fresh
The lovely moments outweigh the bad ones by a meaningful margin.|Fresh
...a rumination and an affirmation on the female lifeforce, and its evolution throughout the 20th century...|Fresh
Mike Mills' whip-smart film revolves around a single mother and her adolescent son amid a time brimming with cultural change and rebellion.|Fresh
This movie, too, is like a collection of snapshots, frozen in time, as each generation struggles to understand eternal human mysteries that may only make sense as time goes by.|Fresh
20th Century Women is really more mixtape than movie.|Fresh
20th Century Women doesn't entertain, not as a moment in time or as a study in 20th century women's characters.|Rotten
20th Century Women is a smart, funny, warm winner capable of staving off the January blues.|Fresh
Mike Mills's new movie is full of small, precise moments.|Fresh
A solid feminine/feminist film with an excellent cast. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It has the quality of a remembrance, not quite idealized but seeped in good memories and great textural details...|Fresh
The narrative is fully under the director's control, but in this case this isn't a good thing because he controls the past, present, and future, thus the character development is linear and banal.|Rotten
Writer/director Mike Mills, who gave us the fabulous film Beginners, tries hard to inject style into this semi-biographical coming-of-age yarn, but it's a long, slow haul.|Rotten
20th Century Women isn't a perfect film -- some of the changes in perspective are a little jarring and the resolution feels rushed. But Mills has a keen eye for observational detail and the world he creates feels authentic.|Fresh
Filled with fantastic actresses not only interacting with cultural touchstones, but playing characters trying to make sense of their life through art.|Fresh
Mills is clearly fond of all these characters, and is happy to dwell on their moments of happiness and sadness, all of which provide knowledge and worldly wisdom to the teenage boy whose life they will so profoundly affect.|Fresh
A thoroughly entertaining, sophisticated, beautifully crafted film. Highly, highly recommended.|Fresh
Often warm and funny, this isn't [simply] a rosy-hued view of those long-ago days.|Fresh
Although there are some great insights into the era (late 70s) and the struggle to counter the generation gap is effective, the film feels like a contrivance, despite Bening's superb and refreshingly 'real' portrayal|Fresh
'Quirky' can often be a dirty word, though it does apply somewhat here. Yet, thanks to its five main performers, 20th Century Women feels whole and human. It was only raised quirky.|Fresh
It's a nice film with some great moments but Mills' touch is too tentative to make all that talk buzz and hum as resonantly as it should.|Fresh
Highly recommended as one of the year's best.|Fresh
Mills has created an incredible, heart-warming drama. I could listen to these characters talk and watch them interact for hours.|Fresh
Mike Mills' new film 20th Century Women resonates because it is intimidating and deep.|Fresh
"When ""20th Century Women"" ends, it's not with the same air of hope and possibility. That's after all, not its purpose. Instead it finds an essential shared moment in time where these great characters converge...'we'll always have Santa Barbara in '79.'"|Fresh
We finally have a good film that explores what it looks like to raise a male feminist, particularly during this crucial era. More importantly, we finally have a film that actually cares to do so (shout out to writer/director Mike Mills).|Fresh
Mike Mills' 20th Century Women features a magnificent ensemble and several intriguing characters, but thanks to a slight case of overcrowding, many of them and their connections to each other are left largely unexplored.|Rotten
Through a polaroid aesthetic and a psychedelic and selective image distortion, the film embarks us on an iconoclastic journey through the devastating irruption of punk in American culture. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bening shines in 20th Century Women, a small gem of a film.|Fresh
Clean-shaven Billy Crudup comes off like a creep, but give him a big floppy '70s moustache and the guy's a movie star.|Fresh
Annette Bening gives a subtle tour de force as the crumbling heroine of this feminist epic.|Fresh
A missed opportunity.|Rotten
There are louder films jostling for attention out there. This one is the secret treasure of the season, though - crafted with tender precision, and built to last.|Fresh
There's a certain arch self-awareness in the screenwriting that won't appeal to everyone, but I loved the film for its scrapbook structure, its warmth and candour.|Fresh
Too often, one yearns for the simple organising principles of three-act structure and boring linear storytelling.|Fresh
More a series of intense character studies than a coherent, linear story, 20th Century Women is nonetheless suffused with charm.|Fresh
A story about the lives of women, the challenges of parenthood, the value of art and a recent past that now seems unreachable.|Fresh
Given the impressive intellectual and cultural insight of certain scenes, the narrative aimlessness is frustrating, as emotion is built only to dissipate. Overall, 20th Century Women is somewhat less than the sum of its parts.|Rotten
A film about people fumbling through life, often feeling lost and confused, that does something very special - it avoids mawkish sentimentality and rings completely true.|Fresh
The highlight ... is the sparkling screenplay, blending wry observation, provocative conversation and frequent hilarity.|Fresh
A poignant reflection of life's joys and sorrows with a smartly written script from director Mike Mills and an understanding of the scary, wonderful things that happen to everyone as they grow up and older.|Fresh
While all the cast are sublime, this is Bening's film. She is incredible. It is a performance of the utmost nuance.|Fresh
This incredibly well written film - where nothing yet everything happens - shows how short our time is and how important it is to remember that and to be with people who matter.|Fresh
Exasperatingly supercilious and smug - unfocused, self-consciously cute, nostalgic and empathetic, but never properly funny. It feels like someone else's long therapy session.|Rotten
20th Century Women, deeply charming though it is, takes its cues from Dorothea's parenting. It may seem all loosey-goosey but there's a dictatorial streak underneath, as there is in so much US filmmaking, indie or otherwise.|Rotten
Mills brings the era alive with spot-on pop culture asides, but he smartly makes the movie all about Bening, who crafts a brilliant portrait of a woman unwilling to pamper her son or shield him from the realities of her own life ...|Fresh
Eras and generations mingle productively in this film. It's a social-historical mural that exists in flexitime, where America the Beautiful is an eternal and unassailable dream.|Fresh
Annette Bening was straight-up robbed of an Oscar nod. This is a delight from start to finish, thanks to a warm-hearted script and terrific performances.|Fresh
Bening beautifully captures the internal devastation of a well-meaning mother who isn't ready to let go of her son and ultimately loses sight of her own worth.|Fresh
You won't see any other film this year that tries as hard to get under the skin of its characters as Mike Mills' 20th Century Women. That's both its glory and what makes it sometimes such a trial.|Fresh
An insightful and, on occasion, laugh-out-loud piece of filmmaking. Artfully shot and structured, while its warmth and wit shine as brightly as the Californian sun.|Fresh
A poignant, often hilarious tapestry of family and femininity and masculinity and mortality anchored by two of the most undervalued actresses in the world.|Fresh
Mills' perspective on formative relationships is absorbing, and he seems like a great guy.|Fresh
Poignant and hilarious and wise, a melancholy ode to a moment when the world was changing for women (and men)... and how it still and always is.|Fresh
It's the character of Dorothea which makes this such a wonderful piece of cinema, with Bening turning in a remarkably nuanced performance.|Fresh
Acting honours go to Bening, but it's Mills' wit and originality that make this story-lite dramedy shine.|Fresh
20th Century Women speaks to the ultimate inscrutability of each and every human being.|Fresh
Though aspects of Mills' film play out like a guide to the female psyche, for the most part this is a poignant and witty mix-tape.|Fresh
The film does have some problems with its pacing, but the energy jumps up when any of the three female leads are on screen.|Fresh
Sometimes Dorothea seems like a time traveler, and so does Mills, as he offers this wry elegy for a loved one and her era.|Fresh
This film belongs to Annette Bening; it's hard to imagine any other actress pulling off her role with such wit and flair.|Fresh
20th Century Women is really a politically correct emotional biography of that 21st-century anomaly: a non-gender-specific male.|Rotten
It is Jamie, as played by Lucas Jade Zumann, who gets your attention.|Fresh
"""Women"" an actresses' showcase."|Fresh
A beautiful depiction not just of family but of different generations of characters, mainly women, and what it means to be one in a time of transition and growth.|Fresh
Personal history is an enchanting muse, particularly in the hands of a skilled and thoughtful filmmaker whose story is worth sharing.|Fresh
Writer-director Mike Mills creates a world that feels at once distinctly individual and broadly typical, and it's the same for his characters: We recognize these quirky-ordinary people, even though we've never met anybody exactly like them.|Fresh
The bottom line is this: Anytime you get the chance to see Annette Bening work, you should. 20th Century Women is an exceptional film that speaks to all of us.|Fresh
Mills, a graphic designer, injects 20th Century Women with beautiful, hazy, colourful effects and interstitial artistic side notes, and they only add to the experience of this eminently watchable film, a love letter from son to mother.|Fresh
Mike Mills gets just the right bittersweet tone here.|Fresh
At times, the whole thing smells of period psychobabble, but it's more often a compelling coming-of-age tale with accomplished cast to match.|Fresh
Though there isn't much of a message to glean from this inappropriately-titled homage to the dawn of female empowerment, one can easily appreciate its vivid triptych of poignant personal portraits.|Fresh
Dorothea may be eccentric, but she's never reduced to the cutesiness often seen in pop-culture moms. Bening's work is just too prickly and warm and real.|Fresh
20th Century Women isn't overtly that funny, but it's nicely witty and droll enough to bring forth happy laughs and chortles anyway.|Fresh
Brilliantly acted, lovingly shot by Sean Porter and seamlessly edited by Leslie Jones, Mills shows that the near virtuoso brilliance of Beginners was hardly a fluke.|Fresh
Dorothea's swirling mix of worry and resilience forms the film's center. It also makes 20th Century Women, a movie detailing history, an oddly perfect movie for the present.|Fresh
There's that old expression-may you live in interesting times. Mills' addendum to that is: And may you be raised by interesting women.|Fresh
It's a sweet memory of a movie. It's just a little too pretty.|Fresh
It may not be the movie about the cusp of the '70s and the '80s, but it gets so much so right that it's immersive: a bittersweet reminder of a lost world.|Fresh
Bening's Dorothea... Her baffled but sympathetic expression, her pitch-perfect, one-woman Greek chorus approach to child-rearing, and her essential maternal wisdom add up to one of the finest performances of this past year, in any category.|Fresh
When you don't buy into a movie, even the skillfully-turned witticisms float there as isolated one-liners instead of insights in a larger, connected tapestry.|Rotten
The title is a bit of a misnomer.|Rotten
The film provides that rush of pleasure and sadness that can come from pulling a favorite album out of the basement and putting it on the turntable. The moment in your life the music connects to is long gone. But it still makes you dance.|Fresh
Mills' script is shot through with such gems, precisely worded and beautifully said by a talented ensemble.|Fresh
"It's the texture Mills brings to his characters that completely sells ""20th Century Women,"" securing a rich understanding of personality to go along with his more artful take on the flow of life."|Fresh
What's intended to be poignant or profound is instead too precious, and what's meant to be insightful is often confusing.|Rotten
Touching and well-crafted.|Fresh
Nothing huge happens, but all of it evokes the subtle stuff that makes us the men and women we are, were, and will be.|Fresh
It all seems like an excuse for writer/director Mike Mills to revel in the time and place and play lots of cool music.|Rotten
Mills' follow up to Beginners is another warmly original film as quirky as it is heartfelt.|Fresh
Simply put, they are not very interesting or intelligent people. They're just a bunch of rudderless nitwits drifting down this lazy and chaotic river of a movie.|Rotten
Mills' setup could be played for sitcom shallowness, but here his two leads inhabit their characters with small gestures and moments that add up to an unexpectedly compelling film.|Fresh
This movie is delightful -- funny and dreamy and sometimes desperately sad.|Fresh
Mills has crafted a loving tribute to the women in his life, and all three of Jamie's would-be maternal figures are fascinating, fully realized characters.|Fresh
There are moments when the movie is wittily revolutionary.|Fresh
"The boy ""coming of age"" in it isn't that interesting. But the women..."|Fresh
Empathetic and self-searching...a highly witty, deeply humane look at people who may be too conscious for their own good, people who think and feel too much ever to be truly happy.|Fresh
A rather poorly directed and edited movie about a mother struggling to raise her son in a world she doesn't quite understand or embrace.|Rotten
20th Century Women, itself melancholic, is a medicine for melancholy.|Fresh
...for most of these characters, this is a season of life in which everything seems to be happening too quickly.|Fresh
Mills puts so much of himself into his work, you can almost see yourself.|Fresh
Mills tells his story with a glancing quirkiness, both affectionate and meandering.|Fresh
The most surprising part of the movie is how well Mills writes his three women, and how accurately he pinpoints their very distinct anxieties.|Fresh
The result is a film that alternates between universality and navel-gazing, with the latter turned irritating and the former too superficial|Rotten
Boasting a perfectly-curated score to go along with well-timed use of archival footage, Mills beautifully captures the passage of time and the changing tide of an era.|Fresh
If the small domestic drama established in this rich period setting proves satisfyingly emotional, it is because the characters are acutely well observed, both by Mills's script and by his excellent cast.|Fresh
"There's not a single false, ""actor-y"" note in Bening's work. It is a master class in nuanced acting, and it is deserving of an Academy Award."|Fresh
The women are drawn so fully, and so artfully, that I had to give the film a conditional pass.|Fresh
It's Bening's presence, though, that quashes the quirk factor. She becomes the film's conscience, restrained and questioning, her eyes filled with the turbulent blues of the nearby ocean waves.|Fresh
Bening's characters are always as comfortable as Dorothea's abode; we never see or feel the exertion behind the acting.|Fresh
A funny, complicated burst of joy, confusion and melancholy.|Fresh
20th Century Women will likely mean more to anyone old enough to have experienced the '70s, but the movie's big draw is Bening.|Fresh
"As a celebration of personal and social history, ""20th Century Women"" takes the audience back. But it also lifts us up on a wave of openhearted emotion and keen intelligence. It bursts with the sad, messy, ungovernable beauty of life."|Fresh
Every time the story is on a knife edge and can drop deeper into turmoil or recede back to the normal flows and ebbs of life, Mills chooses the latter. But this time, the strategy works. It feels real.|Fresh
If you're looking for the big plot twist, the dramatic breakdown, the heroic action or some other revelation, you won't find it here. Instead we see a woman working through her life, albeit in unconventional ways.|Fresh
Essentially an autobiographical coming-of-age movie, one that includes a good many affecting moments but, in the last analysis, doesn't manage to bring them together into a satisfying whole.|Rotten
[Mills's] screenplay, rich in the details of a turbulent time as experienced by two generations, is unfortunately undercut by some fanciful directorial choices|Fresh
It breathes with the open-ended friendliness of a '70s film - vintage Jonathan Demme, perhaps.|Fresh
A fiercely inquisitive performance from Annette Bening buoys this otherwise pedestrian indie drama by writer-director Mike Mills.|Fresh
[Bening] devours the role, nervously smoking throughout, shy in the face of her attraction to her handyman tenant and embodying steely frustration at her inability to deal with being out of control. It's the best work she's done in years.|Fresh
There is not a single misstep in this poignant, true, and ingenious character drama, an extraordinary film that is one of 2016's best.|Fresh
After a thirty-year career and four Oscar nominations, Annette Bening seems to have found her magnum opus in the form of Dorothea.|Fresh
"""20th Century Women"" doesn't get unduly hung up on plot, or even with the usual forward motion of a coming-of-age narrative. It's a group portrait of a makeshift family."|Fresh
Every character is fully-formed and every performance is a gem; each actor has a scene or a line or a gesture that tells us everything about these people, and by the end, all you want to do is hang out with them for a couple more hours.|Fresh
Unique, powerful, mature look at '70s mother and son.|Fresh
The most important thing is that Jamie gets to see these women exhibit full autonomy over their lives and bodies. It's feminism through (Jamie's) male gaze.|Fresh
Its charm comes entirely from its characters, and the stellar actors behind them... Sharp, witty and still emotionally resounding, Bening is fantastic as the lead.|Fresh
It might just be [Bening's] single greatest performance in a career full of grand ones.|Fresh
A thoughtful and detailed evocation of an era and especially of one complicated character, with little story to speak of.|Fresh
If 20th Century Women is as wistful and pleasant as an ocean breeze, its message also dissipates about as quickly as the sand between your toes.|Fresh
20th Century Women, in a very real way, is about the evolution of the American female psyche.|Fresh
Willfully meandering but undeniably engulfing.|Fresh
The movie doesn't have a plot, and it doesn't really need one. The stars, all superb, say all that needs to be said in their characters' quiet yearning and desperate search for meaning in a world finally allowing them to find it.|Fresh
Feels amazingly larger and grander than it actually is.|Fresh
20th Century Women is refreshing, beautiful, and feminist.|Fresh
Trying to adjust to the times...It's possible they all have learned some lasting lessons in this preciously researched, suburban version of late-1970s California.|Fresh
A dramedy about a mother's unusual project to teach her son how to be a good man.|Fresh
20th Century Women is something special.|Fresh
A tender, introspective film you'll want to pull in close, hold tight, and keep with you.|Fresh
Annette Bening has never looked cooler or more in her element, as she gives a career best performance in 20th Century Women, which is as rich as it is understated.|Fresh
One of the year's best movies -- a coming-of-age story in which even the grownups are still coming of age.|Fresh
Annette Bening gives a radiant, tour de force performance in a simultaneously overstuffed and undercooked film with a dishonest, oversimplified third act.|Rotten
[20th Century Women is] a multigenerational story that's light on its feet, funny, and wide-ranging, full of bright performances, evocative music, and the occasional experimental flourish.|Fresh
A simply glorious Annette Bening (the Academy needs to that Best Actress nomination happen) leads a stellar cast in Mike Mills' semiautobiographical story about a bohemian women raising a teen in the age of 1970's feminism and punk rock.|Fresh
Its evocative re-creation transports you to a very specific time without resorting to cheap nostalgia.|Fresh
Despite the movie's title and Bening's central role, women are oddly peripheral.|Rotten
"Love and loss go hand in hand in ""20th Century Women,"" a funny, emotionally piercing story about a teenager and the women who raise him."|Fresh
"Despite being set in the late 1970s, ""20th Century Women"" feels like the perfect movie for this moment."|Fresh
A bracing, invigorating gulp of cinematic oxygen.|Fresh
Ultimately, the value of 20th Century Women is that it provides Annette Bening with a prime showcase. It's worth seeing just to watch her grapple with this challenging character|Fresh
'20th Century Women' demonstrates how skillful writing and outstanding performances can transform a simple bittersweet story into something very special indeed.|Fresh
Bening's eyes dance with joy, darken in sorrow, flicker with anger, and mist over with regret-sometimes in staggeringly affecting sequence during the same, long take.|Fresh
"Sensitive yet snarky, observing, ""Wondering if you're happy is just a shortcut to being depressed."""|Fresh
"For those following filmmaker Mike Mills' career, ""20th Century Women"" is a kind of revelation, the ideal he's been working towards."|Fresh
The most pleasurable aspect of 20th Century Women (and it's pleasurable throughout) is that it allows itself to be messy.|Fresh
It is the performances that ultimately ground the film, particularly that by Bening-a marvelous piece of work that deserves all the awards buzz coming to it.|Fresh
Quite simply, it is unlike any other film out there right now, and cements Mike Mills' place as one of the more quiet and profound auteurs of his time.|Fresh
Plotwise, Women is a wisp; as a mood piece, though, it's almost irresistibly rich.|Fresh
What 20th Century Women shows us is more than just a family drama; it's that if you look closely enough, anyone's life, however small it may seem, is a story worth telling.|Fresh
Although there's not much of a plot, Mills's vision spans both the small and large, capturing everything from Bening's dead-serious response to listening to a record by Black Flag to god's-eye riffs on passing time and changing history.|Fresh
Detail-packed but never dull, with dialogue that absolutely sings and characters we want to stay with forever, it's the kind of work that begs revisiting, like a favorite collection of short stories.|Fresh
[Mills is] good with actors, and with Bening especially, he's really keyed into her prodigious gifts.|Fresh
Annette Bening is nothing short of superb.|Fresh
20th Century Women is irreducible ... although certain adjectives and adverbs do leap to mind: generous, reflective, absolutely delightful.|Fresh
20th Century Women proves that Mike Mills is the real deal, that his previous success story was not a fluke but the announcement of an exciting new voice.|Fresh
"Mills - who last gave the semi-autobiographical treatment to his dad in ""Beginners"" - draws on strong memories and a rich imagination to recreate Santa Barbara circa 1979 and its denizens."|Fresh
The movie belongs wholeheartedly to Bening, and to the age, come and gone, that she enshrines.|Fresh
There's something to 20th Century Women, something real, but a lack of follow through keeps it from ever being anything more than potential.|Rotten
20th Century Women...is an indie film quirkapalooza with more great character work and worthwhile insight than such things usually boast.|Fresh
The appealing messiness of the characters ultimately matters far more than the overly neat generational scheme.|Fresh
Every needle drop and every flip of an author's page is intensely felt because we are getting to know characters through their cultural choices.|Fresh
20th Century Women is filled with the kinds of people you know very well or ones you would like to know. By the time the movie has reached its bittersweet, tearful conclusion, you'll want to hug the person who made it.|Fresh
It's not that Mike Mills makes it look easy; it's that he can so deftly alternate concepts and executions inside a concentrated playing field, mining what's present for most, if not all, of what they're worth.|Fresh
Mike Mills's 20th Century Women incurs sorrow at the prospect of saying goodbye to its characters.|Fresh
The beauty of 20th Century Women is that the warmly empathetic Mills never loses track of the characters' anguished beating hearts.|Fresh
When 20th Century Women concerns itself with the utterly human question of personal satisfaction, it's huggable: the kind of movie you wish more directors had the courage to grab for.|Fresh
"Sweet-minded and shimmering in its comedic beats and even more irresistible in its dive into the dramatic elements, ""20th Century Women"" is one the year's most pleasant surprises."|Fresh
20th Century Women is a brilliantly insightful portrait of an extended family told from the perspective of 1979.|Fresh
There is a generous amount of visual and intellectual wealth to unpack in Mills' exquisite 20th Century Women, where female lives are revered, wrinkles are earned, and the idea of a perfect future is astutely confronted.|Fresh
Writer-director Mike Mills again demonstrates a sharp, sensitive eye for the ways that people learn to make peace with lives they didn't quite anticipate or want. The film is lit from within by its endless curiosity about its evolving characters.|Fresh
20th Century Women relegates a set of extraordinary female characters to supporting players in a standard coming-of-age narrative. It's entertaining, but also disappointing.|Fresh
Imagine if Almost Famous told the story from Elaine Miller's perspective ... That's kind of what we're getting with 20th Century Women.|Fresh
Impressive and moving.|Fresh
"""20th Century Women"" is an endless chain of anecdotes, and though many individual moments are winning, the movie as a whole is rudderless. It never achieves an emotional power surge."|Rotten
The sheer likability of these lived-in characters is a powerful magnet, thanks to insightful writing and a note-perfect ensemble anchored by a never-better Annette Bening ...|Fresh
The result is much more complex and exploratory than Beginners which, for all its charm, felt a little thin.|Fresh
Less twee and more textured than Beginners, this is the film that Mike Mills was put on this planet to make.|Fresh
