Harry Dean Stanton saw the road to Hollywood stardom, shrugged, lit another cigarette, and kept walking. Lucky is his perfect valediction.|Fresh

While the movie's dramatic arc is small, at the end of its 88 minutes we emerge refreshed, as if from an engaging dinner party spent with beloved (if cranky) old friends.|Fresh
The holy and sacred gift of watching one of America's all-time most interesting character actors simply going about the business of inhabiting the space before the camera.|Fresh

The poignant story of the spiritual journey of a nonagenarian facing changes in his ordinary life.|Fresh

It's slow, but when it has something to say, it's worth listening to the philosophy of Lucky, a 90-year-old gar in his underwear.|Fresh

It's a beautiful portrait of a kind of dogged stubbornness in the face of the inevitable.|Fresh

It is, simply, a lovely time at the movies.|Fresh
"""Lucky"" is one of Harry Dean Stanton's last roles, a rare leading performance, and it is a treasure."|Fresh

Yet above all, this is Harry Dean Stanton's showcase, and intentionally or not, it provides a wonderful and gently moving capstone to a career.|Fresh
Both humorous and heartwarming, it's a lovely showcase.|Fresh
Stanton is magnificent. He uses silence and rascal exuberance so interchangeably that you know they're rooted in the same place, in a place of hollow disbelief in life.|Fresh
... Harry Dean Stanton is so utterly mesmerizing to watch that you can't help but try and savor every moment he's on-screen, all the way up to the film's highly emotional but perfect final shot.|Fresh
Lucky never reaches for the tragic. It's about the grim absurdity of old age and death as anticlimax.|Fresh
"If you're a Harry Dean Stanton fan, seeing him get a rare lead in ""Lucky"" is a kind of present and fond farewell. And if you're not a fan - yet - it's an essential introduction."|Fresh
The humblest deep movie of recent years, a work in the same vein as American marginalia like Stranger Than Paradise and Trees Lounge, but with its own rhythm and color.|Fresh
The film feels fitting for the final work of Stanton, and one, I would imagine, he would feel is a superb punctuation mark to a remarkable career.|Fresh
A movie that simply wouldn't work without the mystical, almost elemental presence of its leading man, Harry Dean Stanton (who died two weeks ago at age 91), Lucky now feels like the last will and testament of a ghost.|Fresh
Even it weren't arriving immediately after his death at the age of 91, this effortlessly moving portrait would be a milestone in Stanton's career ...|Fresh
"""Lucky"" is a true amalgamation of wonderful characters, none more so than Stanton himself."|Fresh
"Stanton carries ""Lucky"", his next-to-last movie. It is likely the crowning point of his long and illustrious career."|Fresh

[Harry Dean Stanton] gets a last starring role in a bittersweet sunset of a movie crafted as a tribute to everything that made him irreplaceable. It's well-earned and beautifully played.|Fresh

Elderly existential angst, plus language, drinking, smoking.|Fresh
"Nothing much happens in ""Lucky,"" and then everything does."|Fresh
Lucky was written by Logan Sparks and Drago Sumonja specifically for Stanton, and director Lynch and cinematographer Tim Suhrstedt do him justice in every frame.|Fresh
Lucky is a somber movie, but not a tragic one. It ends with understanding, not condescension. It takes Lucky seriously because it takes life seriously-just as Stanton did.|Fresh

Lucky serves as a first-rate showcase for its star as well as an ideal swan song. The man couldn't have gone out any better.|Fresh
"A meditation on mortality and a love letter to its star, ""Lucky"" has a pleasingly laid-back atmosphere and some sublime moments. But this quirky, craggy character study frustrates as much as it illuminates."|Rotten
Mere days after his death, we can't help but feel how sweet it is that Stanton ends his big-screen career with this jazzy benediction.|Fresh
... this is undoubtedly Stanton's show, a powerful love letter to an enduring screen icon.|Fresh
... it doesn't exactly rage against the dying of the light but certainly cusses and blows smoke in its face.|Fresh
The late Harry Dean Stanton, in one of his last roles, infuses the slightest gesture and inflection with the weight of grave experience, but this maudlin drama mainly renders his grit and wisdom wholesome and cute.|Rotten
John Carroll Lynch's Lucky is an impeccably acted yet sentimental film that's bashful about said sentimentality.|Fresh
Every great character actor deserves a custom-fit curtain call just like this.|Fresh
One of the year's true finds, a spare but amiable slice-of-lifer about an argumentative old coot and his equally eccentric friends ... Stanton, never better, deserves a posthumous Oscar nod.|Fresh

Lucky is a genuinely endearing reflection of a type of man and actor, that is slowly fading from this world.|Fresh

A wise and wistful love letter from one remarkable character actor to another.|Fresh
"Everything Harry Dean Stanton has done in his career, and his life, has brought him to his moment of triumph in ""Lucky,"" an unassumingly wonderful little film about nothing in particular and everything that's important."|Fresh
