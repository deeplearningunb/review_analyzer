The most na√Øve man in the neighbourhood|Fresh
Won't You Be My Neighbor welcomes us back to that space during this time when some of us need it most--allowing ourselves to take off our jackets and pull on a warm sweater.|Fresh
Neville's film proves that despite an aesthetic approach that mimics its subject's vintage gentility, if one is keen to read between the lines, politically profound ideas ... might be at play in even the most wholesome of places.|Fresh
After 90 minutes following Mr. Rogers' trajectory, I realized I wanted to be part of that sweet and generous man's neighborhood. Or, at least, not to see it shrinking so much in our sad society. [Full review in Portuguese]|Fresh
A wonderful story about a wonderful man.|Fresh
A feel-good sensation, because its subject was a feel-good sensation. There are few documentaries that feel like wholesome family films but this is one. Overly reverential perhaps, but... an uncynical tonic for a very cynical age.|Fresh

Even those with little prior knowledge of Fred Rogers will likely be left enraptured by this touching and affectionate documentary.|Fresh
Television gave us the Kardashians and Trump, but it also gave us Fred Rogers. Even at 31 years old, when I hear him say he likes you just the way you are, I feel like he's talking to me.|Fresh
A refreshing documentary that comes at just the right time. Morgan Neville delivers a fitting tribute to the man who devoted his entire life to the well being of children.|Fresh

The film exudes poignancy because Rogers was so upstanding, and so open.|Fresh
Like watching an episode of his show, this documentary is just a decent, quiet, meaningful place to spend a bit of quality time, reflecting on the inherent worth of every person and enjoying that earworm of a song.|Fresh
'Won't You Be My Neighbor?' is not just a movie. It's a profound spiritual experience.|Fresh
The strength of this film is that it never allows the myth to eclipse the man.|Fresh
What the movie, unobtrusively assembled by director Morgan Neville, shows us again and again is that Rogers' soothing yet no-nonsense demeanor was no act.|Fresh
You don't need to have grown up with [Rogers] to be fascinated and moved by Morgan Neville's documentary portrait, made in a spirit of admiration, which on the evidence presented here seems well-deserved.|Fresh
This is a must-watch. It deserves it.|Fresh
It's a movie that proves that your past doesn't have to define you, and that your past doesn't also have to hinder the type of person you can become.|Fresh
Rogers' memory left a void of goodness, charity, equity, and understanding in the world, but Neville's film is powerful enough to stand as a testament to the man for decades to come.|Fresh
It affected me emotionally, but it's so much more of a love letter... there was time to go into more and it didn't.|Fresh
It's one of those rare documentaries that should go mainstream.|Fresh
With a world and administration dead-set on alienating those who are different from an aging and increasingly irrelevant status quo, we need Rogers' lessons more than ever.|Fresh
It's tough to make it through the film's 94 minutes without tearing up, and that's not entirely from sentimentality.|Fresh
Fred Rogers passed away in 2003. 15 years later we need him now more than ever.|Fresh
Fred Rogers did walk this earth, every single morning entering through a wooden door on PBS. And while doing so, he spoke to our softer warmer core.|Fresh

[Morgan] Neville is a clear-eyed, empathetic documentarian (his 20 Feet from Stardom is a must-see), and his take on Fred Rogers is a movie we need almost as badly as some of us needed Mr. Rogers himself, back when we were small.|Fresh
In a world of racist, Ambien taking comedians and bombastic politicians, I think we all need a little Mister Rogers back in our lives.|Fresh
Initially, it feels all too familiar structurally. But as behind-the-scenes segments seamlessly merge together with measured grace... Won't You Be My Neighbor? achieves a level of simple harmony between form and subject.|Fresh
The filmmakers structure this profile straightforwardly, but it inevitably becomes a tearjerker, producing a strong emotional response as it becomes apparent that Rogers's messages bear repeating-and relearning-now more than ever.|Fresh
There's a little history lesson here, a subtle political jab there, and yes, a guaranteed tear-jerking moment ... It's a beautiful film for a neighbor.|Fresh
Won't you see one of the best documentaries of the year? Sure you can.|Fresh
Tacitly championing tolerance every single day, Rogers used his authority to make everyone feel appreciated for being who they actually are.|Fresh
Neville weaves the narrative around some of Rogers' favored concepts and core beliefs rather than providing a full birth-to-death biography of the man's private life. It's a wise choice because Rogers' words and ideas are stirringly relevant today.|Fresh

An inspiring portrait that reveals how Mister Rogers showed children that they are loved and capable of loving.|Fresh
While [director Morgan ] Neville has clearly set out to make another crowd-pleasing documentary like his Oscar-winning Stardom, Neighbor isn't straight hagiography.|Fresh

Won't You Be My Neighbor? argues that it's more challenging but ultimately more rewarding to believe in the fundamental goodness of Mr. Rogers and his work. It doesn't attempt to deify him. It only asks you to understand.|Fresh
And what remains so pleasantly surprising is how slyly and smoothly, from start to finish, this chronicle of a much-beloved children's program goes against the grain of the Trump era.|Fresh
Zips through the usual starry-eyed interviews and nostalgia-filled highlight reels, but there is an essential emotional element to the film, one driven largely by a protagonist with a powerful need to express his feelings.|Fresh
It is exemplary in explaining just who this Mr. Rogers was, warts and all.|Fresh
!t's another engrossing peek behind the scenes of a popular culture phenomenon by filmmaker Morgan Neville... in Neville's skillful hands we see just how radical Mr. Rogers could be.|Fresh
Let's not quibble too much. In the end, the film makes its saddening point: we aren't likely to see Mister Rogers' like again, on television or anywhere else in American public life. He genuinely meant well.|Fresh
Refreshing in its affirmation that Rogers really was the compassionate man we grew up watching. It also proves to be a necessary film in its presentation of love as a practice, one requiring intentionality and constant growth.|Fresh

Once the tears start flowing, and assuredly they will, they won't stop.|Fresh
Heaven knows that I myself fall short of Fred Rogers' state of grace all too often in my life, but watching Won't You Be My Neighbor? makes me want to renew my efforts.|Fresh
