A family film that tailors itself to all, Ralph Breaks the Internet should find no start-up issues when connecting with the masses.|Fresh
While the overall allegory, about a father figure coming to grips with the idea of his child heading out into the world on their own, is a powerful and resonant message, the uneven storytelling muddies the waters a bit.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is a fun take on our current technological obsession with ego and individualism. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet will break your heart, too.|Fresh
Leaving the arcade setting for the Internet doesn't turn out to be the best choice for the sequel. It's the arcade and its characters that we fell in love with the first time around.|Rotten
[The script] is incredibly funny without being intellectually insulting, digging into the core essence of the internet and conveying it with sizzling specificity and cunning slyness.|Fresh
While the film feels overstuffed at points ( ... ) the core story between Ralph and Vanellope is touching and shows what can happen when love curdles into possession.|Fresh
Visually it's absolutely stunning, the colorful world of the Internet universe is mesmerizing, and the way the characters are 'transported' from one site to another is so fun and clever!|Fresh

Technical and narrative creativity take the lead in this delightful sequel. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The glitchy, hyper-sugared brand of animation is stressful, and it appeals a bit too much to child-like sensibilities. However, that's not to say the sequel, RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET, isn't without its creative triumphs|Rotten
The main story is about Ralph and Vanellope and how their new environment tests their special friendship. The filmmakers convey their message well and, at the same time, make you laugh out loud at the antics of the key characters.|Fresh
An insane explosion of information and pop culture, this sequel manages to cleverly entertain every moviegoer. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
On its own, its cuteness is contagious, and the animation work splendid. [But] I'd be remiss if I ignored its rampant pro-consumerist bent.|Fresh
[Ralph Breaks the Internet] is a darker [experience] whose joyous conclusion contains traces of melancholy, surprising for a film aimed at children, yet novel for a series potentially intent on aging with its audience.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is filled with thoughtful themes about friendship, overcoming insecurity, and growing up. But it's also just kind of... filled.|Fresh
In failing to find genuine emotion and cogent narrative structure, the movie itself becomes rather hard to like.|Rotten
Cleverness aside, at the end of the day the real emotional center of this movie is (still) the friendship between Vanellope and Ralph.|Fresh
Should you be concerned about Disney's inexorable stranglehold over popular entertainment? Probably.|Fresh
"What should be subtitled ""Disney's Death Race 2000: When Friends Collide"", it offers Disney flamboyance, self-deprecating humor, and the sort of pathos that may draw a tear or two from even the least sentimental viewer."|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet works best when underlining the bonds of the characters and parodying Disney's story templates. When it comes to the world building of the Internet, however, it sinks.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is firing on all cylinders and repeat viewings will be a must to catch every gag, while John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman are just as heckin' delightful as they were first time around.|Fresh
Despite its minor weaknesses, Ralph Breaks the Internet is a great expansion on the original concept and for those who are willing and able to embrace the setup it will be a thoroughly enjoyable experience.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet provides a fun, family-friendly time at the movies.|Fresh
I can confidently say that Ralph Breaks the Internet is a complete delight and better than its predecessor in nearly every way.|Fresh
Thus, with an extraordinary visual display, Ralph Breaks the Internet is entertainment without shrillness, but built with indelible sympathy and nobility. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It was worth waiting for a continuation of the adventures of Ralph and Vanellope. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Ralph Breaks the Internet] is better than the original. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The real success to Ralph Breaks the Internet is how, while having the most amount of fun possible, it's also able to be cleverly subversive and deeply rooted in its themes of friendship, and all the ups and downs that follow.|Fresh
The follow-up matches the same high standards, not just in terms of brilliant animation and fresh ideas, but also by retaining the heart and wit of the original.|Fresh
'Ralph Breaks the Internet' is every bit as narratively enjoyable, visually ambitious, and gorgeously animated as its predecessor.|Fresh
A progressively underwhelming sequel...|Rotten
Ralph Breaks the Internet would've been a fun but soulless movie if not for its nuanced and necessary story about friendship.|Fresh
This charming sequel is a creative, sweet adventure tale of loyalty and friendship that will delight adults and kids alike.|Fresh
Movies don't get more timely than Ralph Breaks the Internet - an exhilarating yet dismaying sequel to 2012's Wreck It Ralph, for my money easily the smartest and most endearing Disney animated feature of recent years.|Fresh
While the film doesn't quite reach the bar set by its predecessor, it's propulsive enough to build up enough goodwill long before it reaches its rocky third act.|Fresh
An awesome movie for pre-teens that uses hip humor to comment on our world while being unafraid to make us feel real emotions. Add Disney princesses freed from their corsets, and you've got the feel good Disney ethos updated for our electronic age.|Fresh
Director Rich Moore's return to the gaming world he so brilliantly created in 2012's Wreck it Ralph is a sometimes uneven, but ultimately endearing and satisfying sequel.|Fresh
The visualisation of the internet is dazzling to look at, but its conception emphasises reference over wit. Luckily the stellar character comedy more than makes up for this.|Fresh
The perception of the net is cool and apt, even if it is geared at kids, and the directors are not afraid to depict the problems of trolling and the dark net, and the perils of online fame.|Fresh
Younger audiences are, or soon will be, entering the world wide web with eyes as fresh as Ralph's. Such frankness with important messages feels endearing.|Fresh
Who knew we needed to see the Disney Princesses as the Avengers, well in Ralph Breaks the Internet we did, and it's pretty dang cool.|Fresh
Gets by on the quality of its animation and a few moments of true inspiration.|Fresh
The real-life name-checks are a little irritating...and the film is a good 15 minutes too long, but the script is a step up from the original and helped by a brilliantly funny Disney princess scene.|Fresh
(It's) a worthy successor to the original (even as it becomes a very different thing on its own), and it presents a pitch-perfect lampooning of our current society.|Fresh
As much fun as Wreck It Ralph was it actually pales in comparison to the sequel, which is such a vibrant, funny, inventive, surprise-filled adventure it reminds you that Hollywood can occasionally get follow-ups right.|Fresh
The comedy is limited by parodying characters from previous movies produced by Disney and Pixar. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
The film knows how to play with the expressive dichotomies while developing its survival adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Delightful, highly imaginative and creative. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet suffers from the same insidious problems that sink almost every internet-related movie.|Rotten
[T]akes full advantage of the breadth of Disney's pop culture holdings ... Vanellope's encounter with all of the Disney Princesses (and yes, I mean all of them) alone is worth the price of admission.|Fresh
The film merits a second and third viewing for fans of Easter egg hunts. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The sequel now repeats the same winning formula of its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Whereas many of us find the Internet intermittently breaks us, here Ralph's doing the damage. It does go on a bit, moving from one incident to another. Still its cheer, inventiveness and strong female characters hide any cracks (insecurities?) of its own.|Fresh
The story takes forever to get going, but this animated caper is fizzing with bright ideas, the best of which is a skit featuring all of Disney's princesses.|Fresh
The concept and the jokes aren't great, but there's a whooshing, kid-pleasing flair to the film, and it gets away with a few brazenly commercial nods to other Disney movies.|Fresh
Friendship is a timeworn theme of family-friendly films, but Ralph Breaks the Internet handles it with nuance and insight that feels vital in these divisive times when differences of opinion and personality too often lead to broken bonds.|Fresh
This is a film that should leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth for any number of reasons, and yet tells a story charming enough to make it easy to overlook the corporate nature of the whole project.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks The Internet still rates as a triumphant return for a beloved set of characters that will charm, exhilarate and wildly entertain on its own terms.|Fresh
Conceptually, it's rather ingenious, with well-aimed barbs at abusive commenter culture and social-media narcissism that adds up to a welcome moral for small fry...|Fresh
[A] charming buddy comedy...|Fresh
Inventive, funny and fast-paced, it's the rare example of a sequel that improves upon the original.|Fresh
Though, overall, it lacks the charm of its predecessor, Ralph Breaks the Internet is still a very good sequel from the most unlikely of characters.|Fresh
Manages to integrate the [internet's] simultaneous vastness & intricacy in a way that's both inventive in pushing the narrative forward & just fun to behold for its own sake.|Fresh
Equal parts funny, touching, and great-looking, Ralph Breaks the Internet is the rare animated sequel that's better than the original.|Fresh
There are brilliant individual moments of inspiration here that surpass anything done in Wreck-It Ralph, but for the most part it's just a remastering of the first film.|Fresh
Despite all the great things about Ralph Breaks the Internet, the movie gets slightly derailed in the middle act, but it's easier to look past is because you'll likely be focusing on all the Disney easter eggs and nostalgia throughout.|Fresh
The nuanced friendship between Ralph and Vanellope remains the most engaging part of the film, once you've overcome the slight weirdness of a hulking man being best mates with a small girl.|Fresh
A high concept script pokes fun at our online obsessions and Reilly and Silverman resume their voice roles with aplomb.|Fresh
There are a lot of funny pop culture references and internet references to go along with the film's central message about the nature of friendship. The story is heartwarming, funny and cleverly constructed.|Fresh
A persistent kowtowing to corporate interests flattens the satire. More logos will fly at punters during the film than they are likely to encounter in the preceding commercials.|Fresh
A joyful sequel, one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
First and foremost it's great fun, secondly it offers pretty strong feminist role models...|Fresh
Another win, but only just.|Fresh
It will more than reward your investment of time, money and popcorn.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is a rare sequel that actually improves upon the original.|Fresh
Still, beneath the plethora of in-joke Easter eggs and already dated social media gags lies a film on a Pixar-like mission to make parents blub into their popcorn.|Fresh
When it works, it works well; when it doesn't, it's not long before it does again.|Fresh
It's all too clever by half -- or rather, by about 20 minutes; its feathery charms are hard put to support nearly two hours' running time.|Rotten
...the scene featuring the princesses dispelling their girly pre-Me Too-era images is worth the price of admission alone.|Fresh
But it finds time for the message that the bonds of friendship we hold in our hearts far outweigh the little red hearts we collect from strangers.|Fresh
Levelling up from the original with it's charming humour, smooth animation and lovable characters.|Fresh
Incisive, inventive satire, filled with humor, heart and meta moments...|Fresh
"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" ... and the box office."|Fresh
In a sense, Ralph Breaks The Internet is like most things online these days; it's amusing while you're engaged with it but as soon as your mind is elsewhere, there's not all that much about it to hold on to.|Fresh
Surprisingly enjoyable, if not predictable.|Fresh
"I asked my son what was his favourite part and his answer wasn't ""I loved the joke about autofill. It totally rang true with my experience of Google's browser data."""|Fresh
Adds a hefty amount of complexity with dazzling animation, an abundant amount of creativity, and a mature story that will wreck you like its main character.|Fresh
There's an insecurity to Ralph, accentuated by the fact Vanellope doesn't need Ralph's help anymore. The way they visualize that with a massive metaphor is both brilliant and heartbreaking.|Fresh
It's approximately as funny and endearing as the first one (which is to say it's a good time, but nothing special).|Fresh
I have mixed feelings for Ralph Breaks the Internet. I really wanted it to be as good as the first. Sadly, it's not, but it's still a good film.|Fresh
Bounces easily between edgy humour and sweet sentimentality.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is a B+ kids movie and an A+ parental nightmare.|Fresh
It's a neat satire of the World Wide Web that manages to communicate its message, look amazing, and have a lot of fun without getting lost in the constant babble and frontal cortex frying saturation of the online world.|Fresh
"Delightful, dense and sweetly disarming, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" works, as the best Disney animated films do, on several levels, meaning parents can enjoy it as much as the kids."|Fresh
Yes, there are a lot of in-jokes, but they are consistently funny, and Ralph and Vanellope have a gift for turning standard tropes sideways.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is more emotive than the original despite its flaws. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The highly witty original was about learning and appreciating the groove you're in; the sequel seems stuck in it.|Rotten
Ralph Breaks the Internet juggles its pieces well, resulting in a smooth sequel experience that doesn't force an unnecessary mandate on its characters.|Fresh
[Ralph Breaks the Internet] marries that sensibility with messaging everyone can relate to, and it's not afraid to slightly venture into complex, darker ideas while being family-friendly for the most part.|Fresh
What starts as a splatter-gun celebration of cyberspace spectacle becomes a savvy, sweet fable of friendship and online distraction, its in-jokes and emotional stakes interwoven with surprising subtlety.|Fresh
Fear not, because as much fun as Wreck-It Ralph is, there's no doubt that Ralph Breaks the Internet is better - smarter, funnier, and with a message that resonates for kids and adults alike.|Fresh
By no means a classic, or capable of making much of a stir on the actual Internet, this animated sequel is coded to entertain, and that it does.|Fresh
[This] sequel... is quite a bit weirder, and possibly even disturbing in parts, but some clever ideas and the strong friendship between Vanellope and Ralph - and our love for them - carry things through.|Fresh
A spirited and funny sequel to Wreck-It-Ralph . Lots of good gags involving the internet and one terrific sequence where Disney spoofs their own beloved princesses is worth the price of admission alone.|Fresh
It's a lot of fun: cute characters and pretty colors for the kids; and lots of punny laughs for dads and moms.|Fresh
"Though not as funny as its 2012 predecessor, ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" it does offer some nice-looking peeks into its animated cyber world. (And, oh, by the way, why aren't they calling it ""Ralph Wrecks the Internet""?)"|Fresh
Why not the automatic alliteration Ralph Wrecks? At just shy of two-hours, many younger kids will end up as bored & restless as their parents & grandparents.|Rotten
The scenes where Vanellope inserts herself into the world of Disney Princesses (many of them voiced by the original stars) is worth the price of admission alone.|Fresh
It's vibrant and everything moves very quickly, which is great for Vanellope but really discombobulates Ralph.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks The Internet is a welcome return for Disney's most unlikely band of misfits, but the style, tone, and creative components all breath life into this turbo charged satire that knows never to take itself too seriously.|Fresh
Wreck-It Ralph 2 takes aim at all sections of the web and largely succeeds in being a fun, touching and relevant animation for fans of the original and newcomers alike.|Fresh
In spite of a near-desperate need to entertain viewers no matter what corner or crevice they peer into, Disney's savvy enough to apply the Pixar formula to ensure tugging a heart-string or two.|Fresh
Where the original grounded itself within its conceit, Ralph Breaks the Internet's much broader one inevitably consumes it.|Rotten
This hyperactive sequel lacks the witty irreverence and nostalgic charm of its predecessor.|Rotten
The exploration of the internet falls short of the joys that made the first film so compelling. At the same time, it will be a fun romp that should bring joy to the family.|Fresh
While Ralph Breaks The Internet brilliantly tackles issues of insecurity, friendship, the courage to take chances and chasing one's dreams, certain messages in the movie are not so ideal.|Fresh
I can't ultimately say I enjoyed a movie that I only enjoyed one third of...even there where it hit that stride in the Disney World with the dark web... I wasn't even all that crazy about the way they handled it.|Rotten
I did not expect this movie to go to places where it did.|Fresh
This is latter-day Disney doing what it does best: simultaneously playing to the kids with big action, slapstick comedy and spectacle while their parents get knowing nods to a more sophisticated adult worldview.|Fresh
A lot of references beat you over the head, but I think that's the point, because the Internet beats you over the head...the end didn't blow me away, though.|Fresh
The more you are engaged and invested in the Internet, the more you'll get out of the references in this movie.|Fresh
I think it works for the most part. Structurally, the first one does work better, but there are some cool things in this movie. It's fun.|Fresh
"An amusing picture, but only for an hour, with the second half of ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" spinning out of control as the creative team tries to find a way out of a cynical, brand-heavy setting."|Fresh
Easily one of the funniest family films to come out of the Mouse House in years.|Fresh
There are enough good moments in Ralph Breaks the Internet that you should not delete any ideas of seeing it. Just be ready to hit escape when things turn to the dark web.|Fresh
There's also that nagging lack of substance that grows more frustrating as the movie lumbers along - a sense that this movie only exists because Disney had a slot to fill on its release schedule...|Rotten
There is so much attention to detail, it's genuinely just fun to look at. Very imaginative.|Fresh
This one definitely can stand on its own.|Fresh
Though the film sticks its toe into the harsher fare of dark webs and social media apathy, it never remembers to relate this form of unpleasantness with the plight of its manic main characters.|Rotten
A creative family-friendly adventure that's a clear step above most of the other animated options currently vying for families' attention.|Fresh
As bold and smart a story about what it means to live online as any we've ever come up with...|Fresh
"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" works well as a sequel without registering as a disposable cinematic rehash. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is, without a doubt, the best film made about the lives of computer programs since the Wachowskis' Matrix sequels; I mean this as a glowing compliment.|Fresh
In a world that frequently feels constructed on doom and gloom narratives, an endearing story about the value and importance of friendship feels both timely and welcome.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet takes the characters into a whole new world, relying on Disney tropes of old and moving them into an environment that's changed so much since video games were in vogue.|Fresh
"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" doesn't have anything new to say about our online behavior; it just wants us to log on and tune out."|Rotten
Brimming with self-aware and topical comedy, Ralph and Vanellope's new adventure is even better than the last.|Fresh
It's a delightful concoction of lovable characters and an enjoyable story, with just the right amount of adult humor sprinkled on top, that follows-up to its original and heartfelt predecessor with gusto!|Fresh
The first movie was such an endorphin rush, it is hard to imagine a sequel that could match it in sweet, rambunctious fun. But this follow-up comes very close.|Fresh
"Impressively crafted, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is full of riches, monetizing the experiences of our fateful duo and their persistent fascination with the world."|Fresh
It's in the grand tradition of the classic Hollywood cartoons in that it provides entertainment for all ages, even if you end up laughing at different things.|Fresh
Somewhere between Ready Player One and The Emoji Movie, summoning up a zero-gravity spectacle of dazzling colours and vertiginous perspectives, a featureless and inert mashup of memes, brands, avatars and jokes.|Rotten
The opposing trajectories of Ralph and Vanellope's friendship, fueled by their mutual insecurities and hurt, gives Ralph Breaks the Internet the little bit of heart it needs to keep from becoming mere product.|Fresh
Disney's first theatrical sequel in decades, and a surprisingly strong case for keeping those sequels quick, cheap, and straight-to-video.|Rotten
A fun, colorful and action-packed sequel that doesn't quite pass the 'Does this movie need to exist?' test.|Rotten
Ralph Breaks the Internet is smart, charming and funny while also being pointed, effective and very timely.|Fresh
"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" concerns a long-established friendship on the verge of inevitable, painful change, and Reilly and Silverman work every part of that dynamic successfully."|Fresh
Reilly does nice work playing his big lug's insecurity and struggle to let his friend go, but Silverman delivers a performance that's downright moving in its expression of yearning - on a couple of different levels, interpretation depending.|Fresh
Rather than breaking (or wrecking) the internet, this movie just sort of indifferently pokes at it.|Rotten
This film is a blast, full of pointed commentary and satire, though never sacrificing the fun factor.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet provides a prime example of how to properly craft a sequel.|Fresh
"The movie is basically a sweet confection that, like this year's ""Ready Player One,"" relies heavily on nostalgia and pop-culture references to propel it."|Fresh
Curiously smug and overly self-aware, [it's] exceedingly busy, but lacking in the heart and humor that were hallmarks of its predecessor.|Rotten
There is a melancholic grace and an emotive understanding to the ways in which friendships change and evolve over time, the continuous inventiveness of the film in that regard catching me by surprise.|Fresh
An expansion on the character that might not have been necessary, but certainly feels worthwhile.|Fresh
It's a rare thing when a film can throw shade at unboxing videos while reminding Mom and Dad they really should check in with their old college roommate.|Fresh
"It's more the equivalent of a spent video game asking: ""Would you like to continue? (Y/N)"" Your move."|Rotten
The internet had it coming and this movie delivers serious silicon schadenfreude. Come for the breaking, stay for the hacking.|Fresh
Colorful, clever sequel tackles complexity of online world.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is a bit like Deadpool 2 in that, while the element of surprise is lost, the film is far funnier than its predecessor.|Fresh
Written by Johnston and former TV recapper Pamela Ribon, the film has a witty logic that's just bendable enough.|Fresh
A total blast! Bigger, bolder and funnier than the original, all while keeping the focus steady on the Ralph/Vanellope friendship. Disney Princesses FTW! [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"The best animated movies are those that feel timeless. ""Ralph,"" with its right-now storyline, seems already dated, a product of thinking that's five minutes ago."|Rotten
It would be better if it went further and wrestled more with the online world than used it as another bits and bytes background. Really, it doesn't quite live up to the title. Ralph could have done more damage.|Fresh
Delightful, witty and exhilarating. It joins Incredibles 2 as one of the best animated films of the year.|Fresh
Will he break the Internet or will it break him? It's painfully recognizable, this neediness, as is the rise and fall. Ralph, c'est moi.|Fresh
By the end, it really hit me in the center. It hit me deep.|Fresh
"Having Ralph show up may not solve all our problems, but at least it makes us forget about them for a while. ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" breaks us up."|Fresh
"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" looks great. But it's the script that gives it its heart."|Fresh
I like what it was about more than how it was about it.|Rotten
As cartoon sequels go, this ingenious romp is a game changer.|Fresh
Offers the type of sweet, wholesome fun parents expect from the Disney brand but also with a few off-the-cuff jokes only parents will understand.|Fresh
Productively acknowledge real-life dangers, with stellar animation and designs shoring up the storytelling of Johnston and Pamela Ribon's witty script...a useful all-ages fable for our time.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet remembers what excited many viewers about the first film on a visual level, but gives them a lot more substance and emotion to go along with their eye candy and pop culture references.|Fresh
opening [the videogame world] up to the entirety of the Internet, including Disney's own marketing sites, has produced a wealth of technology puns, jokes and sight gags and material ripe for parody.|Fresh
"Technology can be tough to toss into kids' movies. The way ""The Emoji Movie"" did it was cynical and cold. The web of ""Ralph,"" however, has smarts and soul."|Fresh
RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET is an engaging, highly entertaining movie break for the entire family.|Fresh
John C. Reilly (Ralph) and Sarah Silverman (fearless speed demon Vanellope) are totally enchanting together. Their dialogue is witty, natural and down-to-earth.|Fresh
Warning: the Disney Princesses may very well turn out to be your favourite characters. Every scene with them, they stole the show and I was left wanting an entire film of their group dynamic.|Fresh
For such a sweet-natured, candy-colored, family-friendly animated adventure, Ralph Breaks the Internet serves up quite the mega-helping of meta material.|Fresh
"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" might look like just another adorable, funny animated family film, but it also connects to our current reality in ways that are downright bone-chilling."|Fresh
It's breezy and fun and, like its predecessor, relies more for its appeal on nostalgia and familiarity than a strong narrative thrust.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is everything that made Wreck-It Ralph enjoyable, painted on a canvas as big as the Internet itself. The satire is sharp and the pace is relentless.|Fresh
What makes the movie compelling, despite the subdued dramatic payoff, is that it is a heightened reflection of our experience - our love affair, really - with our gadgets, our apps and, yes, our brands.|Fresh
The colorful action should delight tykes, but the smart, media-savvy asides make it especially appealing to grownups.|Fresh
A frustratingly perfunctory movie where the lack of a strong central story suggests that no one at the studio could think of a reason this series needed a Part 2 [either.]|Rotten
"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is almost always inspired in the moment. The story team has a good idea that worked in the first film and gives us more of that, in a much bigger playing field."|Fresh
With the help of Reilly and Silverman's performances, Ralph Breaks the Internet brings more compassion than you're likely to see the next ten times you go online.|Fresh
Its impressive how RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET does something similar to what READY PLAYER ONE tried to do, namely satirize our obsession with pop culture and the internet, but be a lot more effective with the message by being subtle.|Fresh
This one has so much going for it, the real charm and chemistry between the voice leads, a beautiful visual universe, plenty sarcasm for the grownups and kids.|Fresh
"One of the film's achievements is that it elicits true dramatic tension amidst the spectacle without having a villain, just two ""people"" struggling with conflicting feelings."|Fresh
I had such fun spotting both the obvious and subtle references and still missed many, prompting an addition viewing. Anybody want to watch it with me?|Fresh
For such a vivid and energetic look inside the internet, directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston offer a shrewd and surprisingly unsentimental look at the dangers of focusing on just one thing in a world full of endless opportunities to connect.|Fresh
The giddy fun of the Disney Princesses scene stands out, because nothing else does.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet [is] a perfectly decent animated film that, to its credit, critiques its title character, despite being unable to transcend a profound sense that we've seen this all before.|Fresh
For as visually arresting as it is, the fact that Ralph Breaks the Internet firmly puts you inside the heads and hearts of the characters is its most impressive accomplishment.|Fresh
By putting its focus on the friendship, Ralph Breaks the Internet breaks free from being just a bunch of Internet gags and becomes something far more rewarding.|Fresh
If Ralph Breaks the Internet were just about satirizing the Internet, that would be fine. It wouldn't resonate as deeply as the first, but with a weak emotional story it resonates even less.|Rotten
In addressing the very real issue of kids and screen time, this is an anti-cautionary tale. Still, deep-diving into the Internet does yield a few treasures.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet brilliantly satirizes the huge companies that dominate online life. A fall out of your chair funny subplot involves the Disney Princesses.|Fresh
Very little kids shouldn't be brought to see this entertaining, funny, and scary, animated PG ...feisty send-up of popular culture and Disney in theaters.|Fresh
Overall, for a film trying to cash in on internet culture, it's not half bad. It doesn't go for any moralizing statements about screen time or get on a soapbox about the potential dangers of it all.|Fresh
There are touching themes universal to all ages, love for both its charming protagonists and the Disney brand as a whole, and it continues to turn the traditional vision of a Disney Princess upside down|Fresh
The smartest kind of sequel.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet takes advantage of the corporate Disney synergy in this awesome, fun, and magnificent sequel to Wreck-It Ralph.|Fresh
Lots of character cameos, witty genre in-jokes, and a heaping of heart from its main characters.|Fresh
It's not just a kids' movie - it's an animated film that can be enjoyed by a lot of different people.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet: A film that mixes every property within the Disney universe, and some that aren't, while finding roots in existentialism...|Fresh
You don't need to be a Disney connoisseur or an '80s buff to get it. The world it's set in is entirely, and sometimes frighteningly, of the current moment.|Fresh
Ambitious, beautifully animated, and clever to a fault, Ralph Breaks the Internet breaks free of the pitfalls of most sequels by never forgoing heart for the sake of bigger franchise pyrotechnics.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks The Internet  is a joy from start to finish. It transcends the ages, leaving young and old alike gawking in awe at this divinely imaginative world.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is bigger and more heartfelt, with some fun Disney nostalgia, but its story gets lost in the online setting at times.|Fresh
While it may not make you as emotional as the first film, it's a must-see for the amount of cameos it includes, two fun end-credits scenes, and plenty of well-earned laughs for both kids and adults.|Fresh
...a natural evolution from where the last one left off, and is packed to the brim with surprises, meta references and immense creativity...|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is full of laughs for both adults and children making it the ultimate family movie.|Fresh
"Much like the World Wide Web itself, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is a lively destination full of promise and potential that nonetheless ends up being a little disappointing."|Rotten
Ralph Breaks the Internet is a candy coated, hard shined brick of postmodernism-a Vitamix smoothie of gags, nostalgia, product placement and Fruity Pebbles.|Rotten
"Within a few years, the specifics of the viral-video gags in ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" will be as dated as a Tay Zonday joke."|Rotten
Easily outdoes the first Ralph.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet offers the worst and best you could hope for in a sequel.|Fresh
"A decent sequel tackling today's technology addicted society with puns, heartfelt moments & familiar characters - all with longer effects than a random ""pop-up ad."" Not as good as the original, but honestly did we expect that?"|Fresh
It's just hard to tell exactly what the point is after a while, at least beyond getting the kids in attendance to cheer and laugh with recognition.|Fresh
Entertaining, and occasionally inspired, but Ralph Breaks The Internet is too often content to achieve a quick laugh, rather than exploring the themes its set-up suggests.|Fresh
While the heart of the movie is Ralph and Venellope's friendship and whether it can stand the test of time and change, Ralph Breaks the Internet is chock-full of other stories, lessons and relationships -- almost to a fault.|Fresh
"""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is giddily of its moment, a colorfully wacky satire of web culture that doesn't care whether it's still relevant in five years or five days."|Fresh
Ralph gets enough of it right to be worth signing on for.|Fresh
If the movie never falls into a feedback loop, credit should probably go to Reilly and especially Silverman, who bring human vulnerability to little bits of ultra-branded ones and zeroes.|Fresh
If it doesn't always work as a whole, there are some great individual moments.|Fresh
It's funny and absorbing, and Moore and Johnston unload some real zingers for the internet age (their interpretation of a comments section will speak to anyone who works on the 'net, chilling to the bone).|Fresh
"You'll LOL, you'll cry-emoji, you'll never look at a pop-up ad the same way again. And while the new ""Ralph"" falls short of the original's brilliance, any adventure with the big oaf and his glitchy BFF is #winning."|Fresh
While those weak connections definitely hold the film back a little, the good stuff is so good, it's hard to feel too disappointed.|Fresh
A witty, fastidiously imagined adventure and a touching, sometimes troubling ode to the power of friendship. But it also demonstrates some of the problems that can befall a movie when its vast ambition and confidence outstrip its finesse.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet, while having the slight whiff of corporate obligation around it, is an entertaining, delightful, and heartwarming follow-up.|Fresh
Lightning has struck twice.|Fresh
This is a sequel that expands the concept from the first film in fun and inventive ways delivering plenty of laughs along the way.|Fresh

The sequel finds room to grow on the original film's premise by exploring not only a larger world beyond video games but also new and more complicated dimensions to the core friendship at the heart of these movies.|Fresh
It's kinetic, clever, and filled with video game cameos, though it doesn't fully achieve its Pixar-perfect ambitions.|Fresh
Deftly defying expectation, the inevitable sequel to 2012's... Wreck-It Ralph, absolutely crushes it.|Fresh
A tale as old as time: The House of Mouse does not believe in bad filmmaking and in the Wreck-It Ralph sequel they tap into their own vault of pop culture and produce a mélange of pure, unadulterated fun|Fresh
It's a poignant buddy movie that's sincere in all the right places, but knows better than to take itself too seriously.|Fresh
Ralph Breaks the Internet is the cinematic equivalent of clickbait - you just can't help yourself but follow it down the rabbit hole.|Fresh
