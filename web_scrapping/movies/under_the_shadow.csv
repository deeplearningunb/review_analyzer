Under the Shadow shows that horror is still alive and well in cinema and not only do I hope that Iran does more genre films, I really hope it brings Iranian cinema out of the shadows and into the mainstream.|Fresh
A timeless story about accepting the mistakes of our past...This is absolutely one of 2016's must-see films, horror or otherwise.|Fresh
An old school chiller, Under The Shadow offers more than just the usual scares. An interesting and welcome entry into the foreign language ghost story.|Fresh
It's anthropological, feminist, and historical. In short, it's excellent in ways few horror films are.|Fresh
Under the Shadow simulates this discomfort and, when the world (and the rules that govern it) begins to unravel in the film's final act, the result is terrifying.|Fresh
Under the Shadow demands that we feel history as much as intellectually acknowledge it. Its important lessons cannot be taught through dates and names, but through something far more visceral, intoxicating and memorable.|Fresh

Under the Shadow is a balancing act of great dynamics, great scares, and is one of the best horror films to have come along in a while.|Fresh
Solid performances coupled with an equally powerful script gives Under the Shadow all the necessary ingredients to be a staple in the horror film catalog.|Fresh
You really feel the terror and the dread, it just feels so real.|Fresh
The use of the chador in Under the Shadow is one example of how the film successfully manages to be both a serious reflection on the position of women in Iran and an intensely creepy horror film.|Fresh
The genius of Under the Shadow lies in the way it builds up the tension: slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, until I suddenly realized I was wound so tightly I wanted to scream.|Fresh
With a minimal budget, [Babak] Anvari still manages to deliver a wholly unnerving universe.|Fresh
A sinister tapestry of urban unease and feminist fury that turns an ordinary domestic setting into a place of skulking terror. Original and deeply creepy.|Fresh
Committed performances by the two actresses help make this uniquely unnerving.|Fresh
Anvari makes great use of this highly specific time and setting -- the air raids are always unnerving and one sequence in which Shideh runs into the empty streets of Tehran in a panic is just terrific.|Fresh
'Under the Shadow' is one of the more technically graceful and emotionally important films to come out of the genre this year.|Fresh
Those unexpected beats make for a deeply emotional and harrowing journey for not only Shideh and Dorsa, but for viewers as well.|Fresh
A spine-chiller about a woman (Narges Rashidi) whose young daughter is picked on by an evil spirit, Babak Anvari's film is essentially formulaic, but its setting, Tehran in the 1980s, makes a difference.|Fresh
[Anvari] effectively gives the impression of both a literal and metaphorical hell on earth.|Fresh
The debut feature from Iranian-born and British-based filmmaker Babak Anvari is an excellent mix of political repression, maternal dread, and suggestive myth.|Fresh
Under the Shadow makes a portrait about the repressive Iranian society of the 80's; that mixture of folklore and religion in the beliefs of its characters and social criticism. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Apparently women should be covered at all times, even if djinn are chasing them.|Fresh
Anvari employs only the cream of the horror-trope crop, from decapitated dolls to creepy mute children and a newly abandoned Cold War-era apartment complex. The effect is a gradual shift from the merely creepy to the utterly terrifying.|Fresh
Yes, if you see only one Iranian horror movie this year, make it this one. A smart choice for Halloween.|Fresh
Under the Shadow is skillful and scary enough to be a legitimate niche hit.|Fresh
Under the Shadow's greatest achievement is creating a genuinely terrifying film that also serves as an accurate and sympathetic encapsulation of life during wartime.|Fresh
Under the Shadow cannily uses a fairly standard, if also expertly staged, ghost story to obsess over a character-driven story arc involving issues of marriage, motherhood, religious fundamentalism and feminism.|Fresh
A ghost story both on its surface and far below it -- a haunted house tale in which the tangible dangers of the war outside are so immediate that no one really sees what's happening within the walls.|Fresh
Under the Shadow is an eerie, often unsettling, Iranian feminist horror film set in Tehran in 1988, at the height of the Iran-Iraq War.|Fresh
It's rare to find a movie that so adeptly frightens us while also giving us something to think about.|Fresh
[Director Babak] Avarni's screenplay is especially effective in how it uses this scenario as a way to dissect superstitious beliefs.|Fresh
It tries to be both a political allegory and a horror movie, never quite finding a way to meld the two together smoothly. Consequently, this is a film more easily admired than enjoyed.|Rotten
Its slowly intensifying approach, use of shadows and suggestion, unsettling soundtrack, and well-deployed special effects allow it to stand nicely next to a recent horror classic, Jennifer Kent's The Babadook.|Fresh
Under the Shadow features two major breakouts: [star] Narges Rashidi... and [director Babak] Anvari, who with his debut proves himself as adept at politically-charged social-realism as he is at horror.|Fresh
"A tightly controlled chiller that carries a whiff of mother-daughter horror classics such as ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Exorcist"" ..."|Fresh
To paraphrase Talking Heads, life during wartime ain't no party, especially if you're stuck in Tehran at the tail end of the Iran-Iraq war in the late Eighties. That's the predicament facing the family at the heart of this nervy little haunter.|Fresh
The jump scares are solid, and earned. The suspense is genuine. And Under the Shadow never loses sight of the basic human reality of mother and child, trapped at home, encircled by a variety of evils, both real and imagined.|Fresh
As much a study of a changing society as it is a story of evil spirits. The movie is first fascinating, then terrifying.|Fresh
Under the Shadow is a skilled, chilling feature debut that might follow you around a while after seeing it.|Fresh
Under The Shadow ... demonstrates how two movies you've seen many times before-an Iranian social-issues drama and a Blumhouse-style poltergeist thriller-can be combined to create one you haven't.|Fresh
Under The Shadow marries haunted horrors with period-piece importance for a deliciously dark ghost story.|Fresh
Horror is the toughest genre to get right, so it's always a thrill when one comes along that not only serves up chills, but has something on its mind as well.|Fresh
With this terrific feature debut, Anvari lifts the veil on his heroines' hidden lives and leaves us all dreaming with our eyes wide open.|Fresh
What's refreshing about the film is that it comes at the genre from a new angle. This is as much a study of a desperate and traumatised woman as it is a conventional horror pic.|Fresh
Under the Shadow effectively uses historical context and cultural issues to draw nuance and complexity from the horror genre, while acting as an impressive calling card for Anvari.|Fresh
Its mixture of detailed realism and supernatural dread shows all the ways a society can drag a woman to hell.|Fresh
A real treat for those who love horror with a brain, this proves there's a lot more to say in such an often overcrowded genre.|Fresh
Clearly the recent wave of quiet-quiet-loud horrors -- and the slower creep of 2014's The Babadook -- have factored into Anvari's thinking, but Under the Shadow works as well as an evocation of a fraught moment in recent Iranian history.|Fresh
Elegantly shot and very well acted. A definite frisson.|Fresh
[Under The Shadow] takes many of the standard tropes of haunted-house cinema and makes a good fist of refreshing them with to its good performances, strong sense of place, and understated political commentary.|Fresh
[The film] doesn't just want our neck hairs at attention. No, it wants our hearts and minds, too, and for eighty-four collar-tightening minutes, it gets them.|Fresh
A quality ghost story with an unusual backdrop and great performances.|Fresh
Though ostensibly a horror movie, Babak Anvari's Under the Shadow is also a bluntly effective screed on everyday female suppression.|Fresh
Writer/director Babak Anvari blends war, patriarchal rule, folklore, spooky kids and one of the best jump scares since Carrie's hand burst from the grave, into a startling debut.|Fresh
Fraught with tension and rife with intelligent insight.|Fresh
This is superb horror with got modern classic written all over it.|Fresh
★★★★★ Babak Anvari's Under the Shadow uses the haunted house set-up and classical filmmaking techniques expressly for political purposes.|Fresh
Like A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, this is feminist horror made by an Iranian in exile, looking in from the outside - and as ominous winds of change blow through Shideh's home, Anvari matches social insights with expertly managed scares.|Fresh
The sleeping and waking worlds begin to tumble together, with cinematographer Kit Fraser using his camera to add to the unsettling atmosphere, spinning the image at key moments or rocking it to ratchet tension.|Fresh
Her struggle to survive becomes a powerful liberation allegory, elevating the film from being just another spook story to a valuable and entertaining social document.|Fresh
A perfect stage for terror...[Reaches] the fever pitch intensity of the very best haunted house movies, jump scares and all.|Fresh
The film's horror is spookily and movingly expressive of the tenuous position of women in 1980s Iran.|Fresh
Under the Shadow gives us something to fear and something to think about, and that's two more things than most horror films can claim.|Fresh
Under the Shadow has everything that makes great horror: a unique mythology that plagues us psychologically as well as viscerally, a confined setting (in this case culturally mandated confinement as well as physical) and good old scary monsters.|Fresh
Anvari deftly builds and sustains tension throughout, crafting a horror movie that respects genre conventions (right down to the safe/not safe ending), while firmly establishing its own distinctive identity.|Fresh
The closing act is more akin to a white-knuckly ride on a particularly ferocious ghost train than a traditional horror movie.|Fresh
Under the Shadow smartly observes the emotions stirred up by a world defined by restrictions, and the terrifying possibility that they might be inescapable.|Fresh
Under its scares, Under the Shadow serves as an impassioned allegory for female oppression - but Anvari doesn't shortchange horror fans.|Fresh
Shadow delivers the sort of sleek, swiftly paced freakout that streaming customers will gladly look past subtitles to experience.|Fresh
Under The Shadow is an inspired psychological thriller from Iranian filmmaker Babak Anvari that effectively delivers the thrills expected, and more.|Fresh
A spooky ghost story that singes the nerves as much as it coddles the mind.|Fresh
Under the Shadow is a movie that will not only get under your skin, but also eager to learn more about the history and culture depicted in the film.|Fresh
