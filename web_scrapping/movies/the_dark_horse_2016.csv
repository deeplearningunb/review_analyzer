"""The Dark Horse"" fully understands that it requires more than cheap uplift to make its true story a truly 'good' goodhearted film rather than just a goodhearted one."|Fresh
A serious, even solemn, tale of personal redemption.|Fresh
The Dark Horse is a rough beauty of a picture.|Fresh
The Dark Horse takes us intriguingly deep into subcultures we might not otherwise know. Unfortunately, it uses storytelling devices so overly familiar and so flatly executed, they blunt what we see.|Rotten
"""The Dark Horse"" is a showcase for Cliff Curtis and shows the actor can give a convincing, sincere and sympathetic lead performance."|Fresh
It's to The Dark Horse's great benefit that this is the rare inspirational true-life story that doesn't shoehorn a fountain of relentless optimism for the future into the proceedings.|Fresh
"If there were any justice in the Academy Awards, Curtis would be a front runner for Best Actor for this ""Raging Bull""-level performance."|Fresh
It might get corny but for Robertson's unaffectedly gritty settings and understanding that modest gains can be enough for checkmate.|Fresh
Curtis sells us on both the man's frailty and his drive; his performance alone is enough of a reason to check this one out.|Fresh
We've seen a thousand mentor-making-a-difference movies before, but not like this one.|Fresh

Potoni can't trust his own instincts, let alone convince others to trust him with vulnerable kids. Curtis makes you see that internal tension, raising the stakes on what would otherwise be a conventional inspirational drama.|Fresh
... mildly inspirational without turning heavy-handed or exploitative in its examination of mental illness.|Fresh
Curtis truly does find unique strains of tenderness, eccentricity and strength in the role. The actor's work, if not the entire movie, is all about game.|Fresh
The deft and highly emotive handling of his condition and the wider ramifications of [Gen's] story make The Dark Horse a lot more than merely the against-the-odds chess story that it may initially appear to be.|Fresh
Contrary to the standard Hollywood diagnosis of mental illness, it doesn't improve according to how much love a sufferer receives, although there is a lot of love in The Dark Horse.|Fresh
Soulful story about chess, mental illness, and redemption.|Fresh
A beautiful and truly inspirational film from beginning to end, The Dark Horse [...] [is] a hidden gem well worth tracking down.|Fresh
It's a feel-good story with the potential to make you feel great.|Fresh
Curtis is so heartbreakingly convincing in the lead role that he routinely frees you of the feeling you're watching one more adversity saga with scrappy kids and a third-act tournament.|Fresh
"""The Dark Horse"" brings Cliff Curtis back home, and he gives a performance that's transcendent in more ways than one."|Fresh
The movie's portrayal of the complex dynamic involving the brothers and Mana conveys a potentially explosive mixture of fear, love and anger.|Fresh
The Dark Horse is loaded with heavy subject matter, but it's engrossing and sure to make moviegoers recoil, cry, and even laugh on occasion.|Fresh
The Dark Horse may not entirely work as a film, but it has an unexpected amount of gritty idiosyncrasy on its side.|Fresh
Combines several potentially tired subgenres - the inspirational-teacher drama, the mental illness drama, and the gang thriller - but, helped immeasurably by Curtis's performance, makes something new out of them.|Fresh
Though based on a real-life story, writer-director James Napier Robertson's film plays like a mash-up of Hollywood clichs.|Rotten
Gen is such a big-hearted character that his story is more than just a portrait of overcoming mental illness or a tale of a loving mentor taking his rag-tag team to the top.|Fresh
Despite the occasional clich, this film mostly feels as messy as life, and as movingly complicated.|Fresh
Sensibly this isn't a play-by-play movie which makes you sit through the matches -- chess isn't a great spectator sport -- and you don't need to understand the game to enjoy the film.|Fresh
The finest movie ever made about the game of chess as well as a deeply perceptive take on the brutal conditions indigenous peoples face in New Zealand.|Fresh
The film explores the damaging, uber-masculine gang culture that exists on the fringes of Maori culture, using chess as a simple but effective metaphor for the struggles Potini and his young charges face in the everyday battlefield of life.|Fresh
At the centre of it is Cliff Curtis, best known internationally for his supporting role in Whale Rider, who dominates the screen as the mercurial Gen. It's a breathtaking performance, note perfect in every gesture, mesmerising in its conviction.|Fresh
Unlike a game of chess, the moves of the narrative in The Dark Horse can't quite be anticipated.|Fresh
A film all the more heartwarming because it is based in truth.|Fresh
Kiwi star Cliff Curtis makes a triumphant return to his homeland with this multi-award-winning true story after Whale Rider propelled him to a career in Hollywood in 2002.|Fresh
A committed, compellingly unpredictable central performance from New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis is the driving force behind The Dark Horse.|Fresh
A solidly entertaining drama with an intriguingly unconventional lead.|Fresh
Robertson gives himself and his actors time to ponder the board and build convincing relationships and tensions: he's especially deft around his younger performers, allowing them to register as distinct, often defiant personalities - pawns with a purpose.|Fresh
A relentlessly downbeat tone makes this Kiwi drama sometimes hard to watch, but the true story is genuinely involving, with an inspirational kick that never feels pushy...|Fresh
The heartfelt telling of a truly extraordinary true story with a mesmerising central performance.|Fresh
Curtis gives the performance of his career as he gets to grips with the troubled mind and generous heart of charismatic, true-life speed chess champion Genesis 'Gen' Potini.|Fresh
It's a film with the texture and truth of life, and at its heart is a beautiful performance by Cliff Curtis.|Fresh
"""The Dark Horse"" is as good a title as any for a film that takes an overplayed genre - the inspirational mentor story - and still manages to surprise ..."|Fresh
Cliff Curtis is very good.|Fresh
This is a really terrific film.|Fresh
This combination of humour and terror makes everything more dramatic.|Fresh
Curtis commands our attention in every scene, not least because we are unsure of what he will do next.|Fresh
The scale and significance of Potini's efforts become all the more remarkable when viewed through the filter of Curtis' committed performance.|Fresh
The strength of The Dark Horse lies in the conviction of its performances. The child actors are fantastic, but it's Cliff Curtis who carries the film.|Fresh
The triumphs of its characters are always provisional -- much like real life.|Fresh
Small in scope but significant in stature, Robertson delivers in The Dark Horse a sensitive tale with a crowd-pleasing punch, even as it declines to shy away from the bleakness of its characters' lives.|Fresh
Cliff Curtis delivers a spectacular characterisation, one which will no doubt be compared to Geoffrey Rush as brilliant pianist David Helfgott in Shine, as Gen has a mild mental condition for which he has to take medication|Fresh
The Dark Horse is an emotionally potent story of redemption anchored by a heart-piercing lead performance from Cliff Curtis.|Fresh
Simply put, [Cliff] Curtis is phenomenal.|Fresh
