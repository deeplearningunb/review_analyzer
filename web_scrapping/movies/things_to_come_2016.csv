A quietly illuminating character study.|Fresh
Progresses towards a quiet revelation.|Fresh
Things to Come has a philosopher's precision and a poet's sensitivity.|Fresh
The movie is elevated by two intriguingly digressive moments.|Fresh
Hansen-Løve's unobtrusive and novelistic approach doesn't see Nathalie embark on a spiral of loneliness or an arc of self-discovery, but a tide of breakthroughs and setbacks punctuated by grace and grief.|Fresh
What a tonic this film is.|Fresh

The film is wistful, touching and funny, not least about academia's preciosity.|Fresh

Its chief asset is Huppert: her naturalism makes every scene engaging.|Fresh
Things to Come is astonishing, bringing delicate truths into the glaring light of day that are as timeless as they are universal.|Fresh
A valentine to an experienced actress who absolutely owns the part.|Fresh
Things to Come is a quiet and reflective piece worth a contemplative look.|Fresh

A career-best performance by the increasingly essential Isabelle Huppert|Fresh
Huppert is sensational at communicating both the frustration and the fight in a woman who never allows herself to dissolve into self-pity.|Fresh
Huppert is the film's chief asset, and her assured performance as Nathalie is a joy to watch.|Fresh
Perhaps the most fascinating thing about watching philosophy professor Nathalie Chazeaux's (Isabelle Huppert) life crumble is the utter lack of drama accorded to various disasters by both the film and its characters.|Fresh
The film has a stillness that lingers with you, as does Huppert's acceptance and grace.|Fresh
Complementing Hansen-Love's deft writing and direction, Huppert transforms what might have been an unsympathetic role into a character who embodies universal anxieties, desires, weaknesses, and virtues.|Fresh

Isabelle Huppert shines as a woman enduring a midlife crisis in this perceptive character study .|Fresh
"Writer/director Mia Hansen-Løve (""Eden"") gives her protagonist little recourse yet Huppert uses these life challenges for mind expanding introspection."|Fresh

This is an intelligently made film about an intelligent woman, but it's also emotionally engaging; who among us wouldn't like to feel that we could persevere even if stripped of nearly everything that defines us?|Fresh
In its quiet, unassuming, almost workmanlike way, this is not the movie for our scary age, but one of many, and right there on the top rung.|Fresh
Huppert's work is perhaps most notable for its understatement and its offhand precision. She's particularly interesting to watch as she receives bad news.|Fresh
Hansen-Løve's gift is in presenting this vast internal journey with elegance and clarity, resisting the urge for scenery-chewing catharsis.|Fresh
There is a certain Gallic pretension here ... but the delicacy and intelligence that the film brings to Nathalie's situation is always admirable.|Fresh

"Huppert excels in projecting the opposite of what we expect. That was true with ""Elle"" and continues in ""Things To Come""."|Fresh
Ms. Hansen-Love observes the vagaries of Nathalie's situation with compassion and lucidity.|Fresh
Huppert brings immense fortitude and dignity to the role of Nathalie, but pity is never an option.|Fresh
Things to Come is a limpid, often surprising meditation on what it is to be a woman casting an eye both toward the future and onto the past.|Fresh
A marvelous slow burn of domestic drama ...|Fresh

Touching portrait of a resilient woman facing multiple challenges as she ages.|Fresh
One can place Hansen-Løve's films within a tradition of sporadic and inconvenient character-centric narratives, which can create a vivid sense of life by sidestepping causality; her movies phase and accumulate instead of moving in straight lines.|Fresh

Things To Come carries a surprisingly nuanced perspective on the sensibility in how to live life in spite of setbacks and discouragement of all forms: emotional, spiritual, intellectual, and physical.|Fresh
"Things to Come presents a case for the intellectual life with more tenderness and gratitude than many contemporary dramas of young, ""struggling"" artists."|Fresh
The film's power is its recognition that, no matter how hard life gets, though, it just keeps going. In fact, that's what makes existence oddly beautiful.|Fresh

Huppert's turn will be listed at the end of the year as one of the finest by an actress.|Fresh
Hansen-Løve keeps Nathalie purposefully in flux and on the move, Denis Lenoir's camera constantly catching her striding hither and yon, proceeding as briskly as the film itself.|Fresh

Despite its high-mindedness, the film's real art lies in its ability to present the hard and complex business of surviving life in a disarmingly simple way.|Fresh
Huppert is nothing less than superb, her achievement brought home by the fact that she hardly seems to be doing anything: an accomplishment beyond words.|Fresh
Hansen-Love comes not to overturn any applecarts, rather to carefully examine and rearrange the pieces of a suddenly shattered life, and see whether they might fit together again.|Fresh

Mia Hansen-Love's precise script, perfectly in tune with Huppert's methods, works like a sharp knife, gently able to slip between our ribs.|Fresh
The story unfolds gently, showcasing a central performance, which, in its deft shadings of vulnerability, anger and stoic self-preservation, is truly superb - even by Huppert's elevated standards.|Fresh
Almost as annoyingly pretentious as it sounds, but it's also saved somewhat by Huppert's prickly performance.|Fresh
Has Isabelle Huppert ever given a bad performance?|Fresh
As a portrait of existential crisis, it might all register as po-faced, if it weren't for the moments of human comedy Hansen-Løve strews across Nathalie's newly uncertain path.|Fresh
This is a rigorously intelligent and desperately sad movie.|Fresh
Nathalie's brought to life by Huppert's subtly complex turn and Hansen-Løve's fluid, unfussy direction.|Fresh

Mia Hansen-Love and Isabelle Huppert prove a dream partnership in the director's gorgeous, heart-cradling post-divorce drama.|Fresh
