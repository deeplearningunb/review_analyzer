The film looks with pleasure, but doesn't fulfill expectations with the darkest moments of his life. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
This magnificent documentary produced by HBO offers a belated, yet healing way of saying one final goodbye to Robin Williams, taken all too abruptly from us back in 2014.|Fresh
There may still be a definitive documentary about this artist in the future, but this one is still good, providing a panorama of a man who lived to bring a smile to us all.|Fresh
The film contains plenty of revealing moments... and as a fan I was transfixed.|Fresh
With a comprehensive archive... [the film] synthesizes the overwhelming pace of William's life who improvised sketches in seconds and even starred in up to six shows per night. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This portrait highlights many moments of true genius, even if we now see terror in those bright blue eyes and rictus grin.|Fresh
You won't get a better look at someone who was a pretty closed book, despite being A-list famous.|Fresh
What emerges is a portrait of a star who never became a terrible dad or entitled monster, but who remained who he was until his final days: a sweet, gentle soul for whom the art of expressing himself was everything.|Fresh
What's even more interesting are the comments from other very funny comics who drop their guard here and speak very seriously about both the comedy and personality of Robin Williams.|Fresh
Rather than excise tangents that don't really go anywhere, Zenovich prefers to paint the tapestry of Williams' life with a broad brush.|Fresh

"""Come Into My Mind"" isn't comprehensive or combative, but an easy ride of memories, with the production gifting viewers one more chance to be in Robin Williams's orbit."|Fresh
What it does give us of Williams's life and career is well-constructed and thoughtful. And you will laugh.|Fresh
The film reminds us of one great, humbling truth: Every one of us is fighting a battle that no one knows anything about.|Fresh
It's a life-affirming film.|Fresh
The smiles are many, and the company is delightful. Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind is never less than engaging and poignant.|Fresh
An affectionate, sympathetic work...|Fresh
Being reminded of those random outbursts of genius and that laugh - dear lord, that laugh - feels like having a Band-Aid ripped off your soul.|Fresh
If Come Inside could benefit from a little more candor and invention, Williams himself prevents it from becoming predictable.|Fresh
One is left feeling that this is the generically structured and tamer 'approved' version of a much richer story.|Rotten
It captures the radical breadth of his rubber-faced, rapid-fire, man-child brand of comedy, which, at its heart, was compassionate and vulnerable.|Fresh
Robin Williams was a once-in-a-lifetime talent.|Fresh
"It almost doesn't matter whether the documentary is any good. Williams is compelling enough on his own, in his run-on comedy bits - Elmer Fudd singing Bruce Springsteen's ""Fire"" anyone? - and in his more sincere moments, as well."|Fresh
The documentary Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind offers a loving but clear-eyed look at a singular talent.|Fresh
A poignant and moving reminder of the personal toll that too often accompanies such success.|Fresh
This film shows that comedians could have their own demons and issues that can either strengthen their career or slowly break them down over time.|Fresh
Less is said about Williams's final years and the exact circumstances of his death, but there is a sense of a life lived fully and wildly.|Fresh
A heartbreaking look at Williams's life and art.|Fresh
Marina Zenovich's documentary reminds us that we will miss Robin Williams forever.|Fresh
It's never boring. It is constantly entertaining, inspirational, full of funny stories, and provides a look, if only somewhat superficial one, into the brilliant, lightning-fast mind and kind heart of the great Robin Williams.|Fresh
That's the great joy of Come Inside My Mind: not getting a fundamentally new understanding of Williams, but just watching him react in the moment with a sense of humor that always seemed to come directly from the id.|Fresh
Robin's story is absolutely incredible and will make you laugh and cry at the same time.|Fresh
A documentary that's sharp-edged, humane, and deeply researched enough to take you closer to the manic engine of Williams' brilliance and pain than you were before ...|Fresh
Williams' stardom and the wonderful array of carefully edited hilarious excerpts won't disappoint fans.|Fresh
This narrative is at its best when we hear direct from Williams, in intimate interview recordings in which he reflects back on life with seriousness that might surprise fans who knew him only as a manic clown.|Fresh
A film that doesn't shy from the well-known darkness in the star's life but prefers to remind us how funny he could be.|Fresh
Ultimately, [it] is a fine film, a living document of the life and times of one of the greatest performers of all time. This film will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll make you miss the singular force of nature that was Robin Williams.|Fresh
