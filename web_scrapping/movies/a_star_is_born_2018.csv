Despite the way the middle of the film sags as it observes but never really engages with the industry, it knows the wisdom in returning to the small-scale humanity of Ally and Jackson for the end.|Fresh
Cooper's impressive directorial efforts give the film an effortless air that recalls the direction of Clint Eastwood and David O. Russell, and perhaps it's no coincidence that his best performances are their films...|Fresh

A worthwhile drama with impressive acting and musical performances, A Star Is Born proves this frequently revisited tale still has relevance and room for reinterpretation.|Fresh
"""A Star Is Born"" proves to be a satisfying, if cliched, version of the classic story."|Fresh
Cooper leaps from one All Caps Scene to another. It's like we're watching a lengthy, spoiler-packed trailer of a longer movie's major moments.|Rotten
A Star Is Born is a fantastic film (...) [b]ut it's contempt for pop music is disappointing.|Fresh
Cooper saw that A Star is Born was long in the tooth but had good bones -- so he turned a worn-out TCM staple into a hot-blooded, vitally relevant picture. Everything old is new again. You could even say it's been re-born.|Fresh
This is a love story for the ages... that's actually more than just epic romance. A sublime motion picture that defies the theory that all remakes are automatically bad.|Fresh
A Star Is Born is a movie about what happens at an awards show, designed to collect awards at other awards shows.|Rotten
Still it is proof a formula story isn't necessarily a bad thing if it is executed well and this is.|Fresh
An admirable film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga put their charisma, personalities, and talent into this film to give it the uniqueness and appeal required by the canonical Hollywood tale they've revived for the fourth time.|Fresh
A powerful soundtrack and fine performances are not enough to save A star is born from being plastic and manipulative. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A Star is Born will tug at the heartstrings of even those who have seen this story play out time and time again.|Fresh
A must-own DVD for fans of one of 2018's best films.|Fresh
With Gaga, everyone who feels the call of the polymorphous can see themselves in the endlessly malleable contours of her face and hear their emotions throb in her omni-generic singing.|Fresh
Ambitious in scope and intimate in execution, it's a film from which two stars are in fact born - Gaga the dramatic actor and Cooper the director.|Fresh
Absolutely deserves to be put up as one of the year's best films.|Fresh
It may be a little less powerful if you know where the story is heading, but it's undeniably a triumph for Cooper.|Fresh
Nothing about A STAR IS BORN feels earned. The movie plods along to the inevitable conclusion and features unexplained time jumps that we are just supposed to accept.|Rotten
A Star Is Born is perfection. Bradley Cooper, in his directorial debut does this franchise right sprinkling bits and pieces of various versions, yet maintaining its own identity.|Fresh
"Note to the other filmmakers behind the latest ""A Star Is Born"" remake: you probably shouldn't let the actor playing the fading singer also direct the movie. And help write it."|Rotten
The film didn't touch me in the heart, presenting more inept than satisfactory moments, both drama and music-wise.|Rotten
This is the rare, timeless reboot that people will want to watch again and again. That is, until it's remade.|Fresh
In the end, A Star is Born becomes a touching film hampered by its own legacy.|Fresh
Strong performances cannot overcome questionable storytelling in A Star is Born, a movie about love and fame in the music industry that just cannot sustain the power and melody of its wonderful opening bars.|Fresh
s a film, A Star is Born is done well on so many levels, from its cinematography to its production design.|Fresh
With Gaga leading the charge this time around, it's easy to see why A Star Is Born keeps glowing.|Fresh
A Star is Born proves Bradley Cooper has a future as a director, Lady Gaga can act, and that for a film that has been made over and over, the 4th time's a charm.|Fresh
A Star Is Born will have you leaving the theatre clenching your tissues, kissing your partner, and blasting that radio to an uncomfortable decibel.|Fresh
Filled with great music, a captivating romance, and fine performances, A Star Is Born is ... an enthralling meditation on how the entertainment industry makes casualties of so many of its stars|Fresh
A Star Is Born demonstrates that good stories never die; they just patiently rest as filmmakers figure out how to bring back their sparkle.|Fresh
"""The third remake of this decades-old Hollywood tale has a lot on its mind about art and fame in the modern age. Yet it also crafts an old-fashioned, touchingly tragic love story."""|Fresh
Another remake of one of my favorite films. Bradley Cooper doesn't quite pull it off, but everyone around him shines, especially Lady Gaga. The script faltered as did all of the songs -- except The Shallows, which will stick in your head for weeks.|Fresh
A melodramatic, overstuffed, cornball of a movie.|Rotten
The story may have begun as a cautionary tale about Hollywood fame, but even set in the music industry, the ending has a kind of emotional potency only film can achieve.|Fresh
A beautiful movie with amazing performances. A must watch for anyone.|Fresh
One cannot help but be swept up both by the romance and the amount of talent on display.|Fresh
offers proof that remakes are not always evidence of artistic bankruptcy and a dearth of new ideas, but can be invigorating updates to time-honored stories that approach the edge of myth|Fresh

A Star Is Born might not be a total home run for Cooper, but a triple is pretty solid for your first career at-bat in the majors.|Fresh
Although [Bradley] Cooper has emerged as a premiere director, there's a bit of disappointment in the air, because the film never hits the emotional falsetto.|Fresh
An incredibly strong film with minimal flaws capturing this heart-wrenching story in a special way.|Fresh
The performances are raw and heartfelt. The aesthetic is honest and the music is spectacular. It uplifts and undercuts with equal abandon. It is a fantastic movie experience.|Fresh
The rare Oscar favorite that's deserves all the praise and is more than just the hype.|Fresh
With this film, Bradley Cooper... [makes it clear] that, like other colleagues, he can act and also deliver a convincing film as a director. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The musical numbers is where this movie shines. You feel every heartache in every note played, every lyric sung, there's a gravitas and a sense of love and care that went into the staging of every frame of this movie.|Fresh
This film takes its well-known story and its well-known actors and shows us something completely fresh and surprising|Fresh
Cooper and Gaga's stars are reborn.|Fresh
The film runs out of steam a long time before it runs out of plot, but when it's all working, this is a perfectly worthy addition to the Star Is Born canon.|Fresh
A Star is Born is well-intentioned, but wants to play it far too safe for any of the good objectives to resonate.|Rotten
"""The dramatic structure is identical: we are witnesses of the birth of a star and the tragic decline of another..."""|Rotten
I really enjoyed this otherwise standard musical for the most part because of the fine performances by Lady Gaga, Cooper, Elliot, Gavron and Dave Chappelle. It is enjoyable despite the fact that the story is painfully clichéd.|Fresh
The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is striking; throughout he is mesmerising, she is a joy. Though this is a story told very much from Jackson Maine's point of view.|Fresh
Gaga and Cooper really click with the emotional elements of the material and bring a lot of energy to the very simple and familiar story.|Fresh
The soundtrack is thoughtful, emotional, and difficult to imagine being brought to life by anybody other than Gaga and her diverse vocal talent, which feels right at home on the big screen.|Fresh
It does what every good remake should do: it tells the same story as before, but narrated from a different and fresher perspective. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I wanted to see her side, internally, where that relationship was going as she was getting catapulted to fame...I would definitely tell you to go download this soundtrack.|Fresh
Transposed into the era of sudden fame and instant shame, the film glistens as a cautionary tale about self-respect, self-delusion and self-destruction...what is especially admirable is the film's fidelity to the original's heart-breaking final reel.|Fresh
Lady Gaga gets her screen cred and Bradley Cooper chalks up his first directorial achievement. Otherwise, it's a wasteland out there.|Rotten
A Star is Born is a musical but without the hokiness. Each performance moves the story forward, with Cooper focused on capturing authentic moments.|Fresh
Lady Gaga's singing talents are majestically showcased in this familiar but nevertheless moving film, an amazing directorial debut for Bradley Cooper|Fresh
No matter what goes on in the film dramatically, everything always comes together because the soundtrack is happening, it's just happening, as I heard someone say in the Magic Johnson Harlem theater.|Fresh
A Star is Born howls in its first half.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper makes a stunning directorial debut with A Star Is Born, an emotionally devastating rollercoaster of a journey that exhilarates as much as it devastates.|Fresh
Cooper has created the definitive version of A Star Is Born, a visually dynamic spectacle that surpasses the limitations of the musical genre.|Fresh
[The ending] will weigh on you the same way it weighs on the characters. That's a powerful testament to both Cooper's treatment of the material as it is the performances ...|Fresh
A Star is Born highlights the absolute best of what cinema and music can offer - an uplifting and sometimes heartbreaking experience that will not soon be forgotten.|Fresh
Cooper has landed a masterpiece on his first go. You could say, a star is born.|Fresh
It's almost as though the film itself has gone self-aware and wants to jump ahead into its own meta-readings about how Bradley Cooper turned Lady Gaga into a movie star|Fresh
"All Cooper and Gaga do is repeat a self-congratulatory Hollywood motto about artists ""having something to say."" Now is the wrong time for that."|Rotten
Excellent acting and direction enables A Star is Born to rise above its somewhat prosaic dramatic structure to fashion surely one of the better Hollywood films of the year.|Fresh
Cooper managed to make Gaga's star shine even brighter. She's basically her own solar system now. Sign me up for the sequel: A Universe Is Born.|Fresh
In its new incarnation, A Star Is Born presents a beautifully told and hugely affecting love story.|Fresh
With the power of its music and its two leads (plus some nice support), A Star Is Born is a worthy retread of a well-worn path.|Fresh
A Star is Born has been retold so many times because it's a great story, and this updated version is surefire hit with its iconic pop star in the lead and a whirlwind romance undone by fame and addiction.|Fresh
...this new iteration on a classic theme is akin to the pop music it both celebrates and critiques: it's insanely likable....|Fresh
If I have any nits to pick it's that there is too much music and it's too long. But so what? It's really good. Go see it.|Fresh
"As much as we might like to poke fun at the idea of ""visionary director Bradley Cooper,"" it's important to recognize when we, the cynics, have been proven wrong."|Fresh
A Star is Born foregrounds all of the ways Jackson and Ally are enamored with each other, the intimacy that enhanced their bond and the affection that inspired their songs.|Fresh
Starring Lady Gaga like you've never seen her before, A Star is Born is a wonderful remake of the 1937 classic of a timeless love story but with a 2018 modern twist.|Fresh
Gaga's performance is outstanding and is deserving of all the praise she's been receiving. That being said, I do wish that Allie was given as much depth and attention as Jackson.|Fresh
The chemistry between Cooper and Gaga's characters is almost supernatural. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hollywood has been churning out remakes and reboots at breakneck speed, but A Star Is Born is in a class of its own.|Fresh
It offers what it offers: romance and good music. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A thoroughly entertaining redo, with excellent work by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper (behind the camera as well as in front of it).|Fresh
It's perfectly comfortable cranking up its emotions and firing them directly into your face.|Fresh
Every man here with a story is cloaked in some kind of misery.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper's modern reworking is passable enough to keep you entertained.|Fresh
The marriage becomes a battle between artifice and authenticity, an allegory for the popular music industry.|Fresh
"A familiar story with enough new twists and turns to keep it fresh, ""A Star Is Born"" is a triumph."|Fresh
A stripped-down version that is raw and intimate, with a pair of knockout performances from Cooper and Lady Gaga.|Fresh
In one scene, in which Ally (Gaga) is dragged on stage to sing at a stadium concert, the churn of emotions crossing her face is simply astonishing and so very, very real.|Fresh
A Star Is Born works because it takes an old formula and builds it up into an emotionally charged story of love and loss. It'll tug at your heartstrings while simultaneously lifting you up with energetic tunes and tour-de-force performances.|Fresh
Cooper's debut behind the camera is impressive in his mastery of space. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film is as good as a modern retelling can get--better, even, given that Cooper brings out the big guns with his intimate and purposeful directorial style.|Fresh
An overlong, weirdly old-fashioned and somewhat toothless epic saved from silliness by, of course, Lady Gaga, who belts out songs co-written and usually co-performed by Cooper with all the drama and fire that the surrounding story rather lacks.|Fresh
If Star is drawing the curtain on the self-destructive cowboy figure and is a love letter to a new generation of starlets, it's almost there but not quite at the drop of a hat.|Fresh
From top to bottom A Star is Born is a success, the rare remake that proves not only that it has more to say about its subject but that there is more to say.|Fresh
The new version of A Star Is Born proves that even the most familiar material can be great when done right.|Fresh
Lady Gaga long ago out-Madonna'd Madonna; always had more talent as a singer-dancer, with just as much biz chops. However, notoriously, Madonna could never act. Gaga blows Madonna's doors off acting-wise.|Fresh
A drama with credible songs in it that elevates an outré personality into a legitimate actress, a vanity project with none of the vanity.|Fresh
Prefers to focus on what great music should be - and how a music career should be run - rather than getting to the heart of what leads to someone to bare their soul through music|Rotten
Cooper and Gaga are both fantastic in roles that ask a lot of both of them.|Fresh
Cooper manages to conjure up a version of A Star is Born with its own personality. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cooper captures those personal demons with confidence without ever leaving aside the charming external facet of the character. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A Star is Born defines Lady Gaga as a film actress, and Cooper as a filmmaker.|Fresh
"Bradley Cooper wants to make you cry. And if you give him a chance by going to see ""A Star Is Born,"" he's gonna do it."|Fresh
"Not everything works in Cooper's version of ""A Star Is Born"" But enough does to ensure that this film is, indeed, one of the best releases of 2018. Maybe, even, of this decade."|Fresh
Cooper has given us a vision of this story to cherish.|Fresh
The A Star Is Born story construction has worked, again and again, because it's archetypal tragedy - nobody believes there's a happy ending in sight. But Cooper still earned every one of my tears.|Fresh
It's heartfelt, well-paced, and gut-wrenchingly tragic, with the gorgeous music and two main characters taking centre stage by grabbing hold of the audience's emotion until the very last second.|Fresh
This is the first version of A Star is Born in the digital age and in order for this story to work for modern audiences, there had to be plausible dimensions between the fame and the relationship between the leads. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"But are we still supposed to celebrate a film that posits the male ego as too fragile to accept a woman who equals or surpasses him? Or that a woman's ""authenticity"" will only truly flower in response to a man's sacrifice?"|Rotten
Crucially, the film never feels inauthentic and the songs remain both organically integrated and highly memorable. Rarely has a film's story benefited so much from its musical elements.|Fresh
Lady Gaga has created a delicate, likeable character who serves as the film's emotional barometer in that as her feelings change, so too will those of the audience.|Fresh
While imperfect, A Star Is Born is a satisfying and emotionally evocative epic. If only it had managed to maintain the intoxicating allure of its first hour.|Fresh
It may not be a daringly original piece. But when the end result is this engaging, entertaining, and heartbreaking, it demands to be called one of the year's finest films.|Fresh
The movie's gender dynamics remain fully intact from its 1937 origins. Ally is controlled and manipulated by powerful men from start to finish, and some of the more emotionally abusive scenes can be disturbing to watch.|Rotten
The chemistry shared by Gaga and Cooper - whether on stage during the movie's dynamic live music sequences, or casually swapping lines walking along a street - is at once appealing, involving and concerning.|Fresh
The vital music scenes are convincing and enjoyably infectious, the romance is beautifully played, and [Cooper] doesn't hold back when the story takes its long-expected turn for the worse.|Fresh
This is a movie to gush over, to see again, to buy the soundtrack to, to urge others to see, to dream about ... Watch it sweep the Oscars, too. I'll be fine with that.|Fresh
The very story of A Star is Born is itself a cautionary tale. Interestingly, Hollywood loves this story. The Cooper and Gaga version is the fourth time the tale is told.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper delivers a stunning and heartbreaking rendition of the Hollywood musical.|Fresh
A Star is Born doesn't push any cinematic boundaries. It isn't edgy or provocative. But it's emotionally rich and hugely satisfying.|Fresh
Cooper, who has turned director with the film, extracts commendable performances from everybody in the cast. The life of a musician is caught perfectly.|Fresh
Overall, A Star Is Born is melodrama at its best, an emotional manipulation that works even if you're not normally a sucker for that type of thing.|Fresh
It's been recited plenty of times before and, even if it hadn't, follows the predictable beats of so many true stories of waning celebrity. That's not a criticism; it's actually what gives the story emotional heft.|Fresh
"If [Cooper] was going for middlebrow musical melodrama in the vein of ""The Rose"" and ""The Bodyguard,"" bullseye."|Rotten
What kept me from appreciating this movie as a whole beyond some very good parts was its inability to practice what it preached and actually say something.|Rotten
A breath of fresh air. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
But there's undeniable passion, talent and naked humanity onscreen, and for much of its run-time, A Star Is Born is impressively rapturous and romantic.|Fresh
Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. They don't make 'em like this anymore.|Fresh
So much better than the Streisand version.|Fresh
I will add to the chorus of praise for Gaga. She's the film's real MVP-a natural actor of surprising depth and soul.|Fresh
Lady Gaga, in her first big-screen performance, acquits herself well in a role that mirrors her real-life self. There's a definite on-screen frisson between her and co-star Bradley Cooper.|Fresh
[The ending] was a very romanticized view of what a toxic relationship is, and I wasn't here for it.|Rotten
Classic Musical With Magnificent Performances|Fresh
The performances are sound. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Some of the best performances of the year...Cooper is going to be a great director if he can continue this kind of filmmaking momentum.|Fresh
If you're able to forget the stars that have gone before, A Star is Born is a very professional tear-jerker with some very loud music, and for many that will be enough.|Fresh
The star who is being born through this film is its actor-director.|Fresh
[Director Bradley Cooper] intelligently allows music to exist almost as a character and dedicates whole sequences to musical acts. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A Star Is Born is something that's easy to fall in love with but not all too deeply. Not perfect cinema, but maybe that's enough for now.|Fresh
This is a not-to-be-missed film and shows that Cooper is a certifiable director, while Gaga shows that acting is not just a fling and solidifies her as a true triple threat.|Fresh
However, after some songs, A Star is Born not only begins to repeat the formula of other films such as La La Land but to repeat itself. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Watch as these two great artists dive in. Oh, the treasures they dig up together. Once the movie lifts off (with this very song) it never meets the ground again.|Fresh
The performances from Gaga, Elliott, and Cooper are amazing. This feature shows a lot of promise for a first-time director like Cooper.|Fresh
Lady Gaga is a natural; Ally is talented and cursed with the insecurity that is talent's twin. Her face glows with natural beauty, not manufactured and not afraid of the camera's intrusions. There is chemistry there ...|Fresh
Electric, compelling and tender, the film is a knockout creatively and emotionally, offering a raw glimpse into today's world of celebrity.|Fresh
Cooper's latest remake of A Star is Born has its high points but, in the end, it's disappointing and unnecessary. Let's hope it is the last version.|Rotten
What Cooper gets about A Star Is Born is the degree to which it is about the physics of love and work. This may be the only mythic narrative about a two-career marriage. It's a melodrama where every action has an equal and opposite reaction.|Fresh
We don't get genuine character development or insight into the industry or kitschy fun.|Rotten
Fused with laugh-out-loud humour, even at the most uncomfortable moments, A Star is Born is driven by a searing authenticity that makes it feel like a biopic.|Fresh
Nearly every moment of A Star Is Born feels real and specific. Often painfully so.|Fresh
For its first hour-plus, A Star Is Born captures the exhilaration of new love and new creation better than any movie in years.|Fresh
While Lady Gaga shines, the problematic narrative makes it clear that it is the unlikable Jackson Maine with whom audiences are supposed to identify.|Rotten
Well, ladies and gentlemen, this duo makes A Star Is Born a new version that will be considered a classic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What could have been a series of vain decisions... ends up being a deeply moving love story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bradley Cooper has something new to say in this version, and Lady Gaga belts it out loud and clear to make this a definite contender in numerous categories during awards season.|Fresh
You can't be a one-named artist if your name is not something like Beyonce, Rihanna, Prince or Adele. You just can't.|Rotten
Love story about two musicians finding it difficult to believe in themselves and their unique voices.|Fresh
One of the best things that this contemporary version of A Star Born does is taking the conventions of the previous incarnations and transforming them into a truly profound experience. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Both leads are fine, albeit one-note, and cinematographer Matthew Libatique supplies some sharp images, but the movie is pervasively musty and false, with some brutally bad songs to boot.|Rotten
... the distraction-free bubble focuses the story on the key players and their emotional motivations to achieve maximum impact... (but) the real villain of this story is human fragility.|Fresh
"It may be that every generation gets the ""A Star Is Born"" it deserves, though what we did to deserve this one is anyone's guess."|Fresh
The obvious question to ask is 'Why go and see A Star Is Born for the fourth time?' Because, essentially, this film steers the same narrative path from previous installments (almost too closely). The answer is easy: her name is Lady Gaga.|Fresh
[It's] a crowd-pleaser and many may not even notice the film cheats them of a more fulfilling ending since it already runs 135 minutes and the soundtrack is a rewarding distraction.|Fresh
A Star Is Born invites inside the rarest of bubbles and helps us grasp the intense pressure that comes with having to perform. The biggest names often hide the most vulnerable souls.|Fresh
Cooper's best decision was casting Lady Gaga and himself as the leads.|Fresh
Cooper conveys the love between both with craft in his directorial debut. But also the fears and miseries that accompany success: Absences, lies and ridicule shift the focus of its predecessors. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Fuelled by scintillating performances and a stellar soundtrack, A Star Is Born is a magnificent achievement that will capture the hearts of almost everyone that it touches.|Fresh
This is the best film of the year.|Fresh
Lady Gaga shines brightly, while Bradley Cooper is phenomenal. Superior to all previous versions. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cooper simmers with swagger before Gaga's vocal force boils the cauldron over, taking everything to another level.|Fresh
Bradly Cooper and Lady Gaga electrify the screen. Backed by a first-rate supporting cast and well-written songs, this is by far the best version of the timeless classic.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga sing loud in one of the year's best films.|Fresh
It may be a fourth version of this time honored showbiz saga but Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga make 'A Star Is Born' all their own- and that's a very good thing.|Fresh
Co-written by Cooper, who also helped write some of the film's music, the script doesn't exactly bubble with wit but it doesn't have to. What matters is that it gives both leads the chance to charm one another - and us.|Fresh
As Ally Campana, a gem in the rough, Lady Gaga is dynamite.|Fresh
It's well worth seeing and marks Gaga and Cooper as two people who have the talent to overcome fame and endure for the long haul.|Fresh
At its huge, pulsating heart this is a story about lovers desperately trying to save one another - from the loss of integrity in an industry that disdains it and from self-destructive impulses with roots too old and deep to be touched.|Fresh
This update is less anguished, has better songs and, even at 135 minutes, is actually shorter than the last two.|Fresh
When [Lady Gaga] starts singing, grab your tissues and hold onto your seat.|Fresh
I heard that it was [Cooper] singing but I didn't want to believe it... ain't no way God gave everybody all that.|Fresh
Not only has [Cooper] made something old new again, he's reinvented it and improved upon it. It's a passion project that shoots for the stars and is likely to strike Oscar gold.|Fresh
It's like settling into the cinematic equivalent of a Lexus 450. The picture is big and lush and smooth.|Fresh
...the juggling act that all remakes strive for, but few manage to capture. Encore!|Fresh
This is a relationship that I cared about, and that's rare.|Fresh
An exhilarating, bittersweet romance...|Fresh
[Cooper's] talent for writing and directing has been hiding in plain sight. After this five-star treat of a picture, consider the secret out.|Fresh
A Star Is Born may not reinvent the wheel in terms of cinematic art, but it's a knockout in just about every other way that matters: it has heart and soul, great chemistry between its leads and some killer musical numbers.|Fresh
Cooper's directorial debut [proves] that he has what it takes to write, act, direct, and even sing, but even more important, he knows how to assemble the right cast of characters to create a beautiful story worth re-telling for the 4th (or 5th) time.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper crushes it... He's a great comedic actor, a great dramatic actor. And he's great in this movie -- also a great director.|Fresh
Sturdy, old-fashioned... Gaga's powerhouse voice is one of the film's key assets... Packs an emotional wallop by focusing on these two faces and voices.|Fresh
It's a film that simply works with a simple plot and entertains with action scenes and effects. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"A Star is Born, perhaps, is a less ""rosy"" version of La La Land. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Bradley Cooper's 2018 rendition of A Star Is Born manages the impossible: bringing this seemingly old-fashioned story about fame into the present while retaining its classical, timeless appeal.|Fresh
A Star Is Born is entertaining, gut-wrenching, and exceptional; with spectacular performances and a top-notch soundtrack, this rock-musical becomes an instant classic.|Fresh
Expect nominations all around, with actor/writer/director/producer and songwriter Cooper on the verge of a boatload, maybe even for contributing to an eclectic, sure-to-be-soaring soundtrack.|Fresh
Cooper finds a new voice too, as a director. The actor understands how to stage a scene (as well as stage a literal stage-the concert scenes are stunning) in ways that, like the acting, feel instinctive.|Fresh
"I'm usually the first to ask, ""Do we really need another reboot?"" But in the case of this spectacular cinematic event, the answer is a passionate ""Yes! Yes! Oh YES!"""|Fresh
If you're entering the theatre simply desiring a couple solid musical numbers, then your $15 will not have been spent in vain. Unfortunately, outside of its music, the movie falls flat as only a two-dimensional vignette of common misogyny can.|Rotten
As deep and resonant as Bradley Cooper's drawl, and as bright as Lady Gaga's screen future.|Fresh
It has weight and depth, and that, as Cooper seems to intuitively understand, adds heft to the story's melodramatic complications.|Fresh
The directing debut for the actor Bradley Cooper is a good one.|Fresh
"Gaga is good but Bradley Cooper is definitely the star of ""A Star Is Born"". Also worthy of strong praise are Sam Elliott and Andrew Dice Clay."|Fresh
It's a mindful distraction that's positively transparent in its intentions and so free of irony that it suggests something almost pathologically indifferent to criticism.|Fresh
Cooper obviously overlooks a potential jackpot in a co-star eager to prove she's not just another poker face. Despite those restraints, she's ultimately his savior, displaying enough moxie and heart to engage, even when the movie fails to match the hype .|Fresh
"The best compliment I can give the new version of A Star is Born is that I didn't mind it. The harshest word is ""forgettable."|Rotten
Can a contrived and shallow love story remain afloat on charisma alone? Not in this case.|Rotten
A Star Is Born... delivers a sprawling relationship drama that fully captures a realistic picture of love.|Fresh
A Star Is Born is part slog, part hymn.|Fresh
Cooper has borrowed [from the 1976 Barbra Streisand verson] the rock 'n' roll backdrop and pedestrian dialogue and, in some ways, its 1970s setting.|Rotten
"Undeniably, ""A Star is Born"" shines due to the realistic chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. This Oscar worthy film delivers on all fronts!"|Fresh
The actors' performances are often raw and improvisatory, like something out of a 1970s movie.|Fresh
A sometimes exhilarating, occasionally frustrating, and always cunning Hollywood product that can feel like a battle of wills between two deliberately self-deprecating artists.|Fresh
"""A Star is Born"" never sacrifices the conviction of its earliest moments, which so smartly connect these characters as artists and humans while also upholding the sanctity of their individual journeys."|Fresh
Despite its long history and many incarnations, Cooper manages to bring something that feels authentic and new to the table with his iteration of this classic film story.|Fresh
it's not a particularly great or profound movie, but it's a hugely enjoyable one, with so many amazing scenes that it hardly matters whether they add up to anything.|Fresh
A Star Is Born is one journey with so many emotions working in perfect harmony that should not be missed.|Fresh
It could win Best Picture, and I wouldn't complain if it did.|Fresh
Everything that it does, it does really well...a slow burn, the length really didn't bother me...|Fresh
Bradley Cooper directs this movie like he's doing just what he is, conducting and playing first chair at the same time, Gaga is a force of nature. She's a revelation in this movie of course, but [Cooper] also knows how to play directly into her strengths.|Fresh
A Star Is Born tells a story many of us already know. The magic comes from the fact that we utterly forget we know it and become absorbed all over again.|Fresh
Mark A Star is Born as the film that crowns Lady Gaga as a powerful and winning screen presence, and Bradley Cooper as a first-rate director and born-again movie star.|Fresh
Germanotta is not Falconetti, but oh, that face in close-up, it is canvas, flesh, odalisque: Matthew Libatique's nimble camera rightfully worships Lady Gaga. She is nothing less than a marvel.|Fresh
Powerful and moving and thought-provoking stuff in an old-fashioned Hollywood romance with a sensational soundtrack featuring two of the year's breakout performances.|Fresh
The duo have decent chemistry together, it must be said, but it becomes less believable as the film progresses.|Rotten
Cooper delivers a weightless version of the story. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
One can't help being impressed by Cooper's achievement here, making this chestnut of a story feel fresh and vital.|Fresh
Soulful, honest and heart-breaking.|Fresh
A big crowd pleaser with genuine thrills, even if second half flags.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born is a transcendent feast for the eyes and ears.|Fresh
Gaga's role might not seem like much of a stretch. But the best parts of her performance are during the first half of the movie when she's playing against type, convincing the spellbound audience that she is not an internationally recognizable pop idol...|Fresh
A Star Is Born is the living embodiment of going for it, one of the least humble, least self-conscious, least self-aware movies in recent memory-and maybe one of the best.|Fresh
My impeccable taste and preferences aside, you should check it out for yourself.|Fresh
It's essentially multiplex-friendly porn, where you discover that you desperately need two pretty celebrities you never considered falling in love to fall in love.|Fresh
A Star Is Born has little insight into where stars come from and even less into how they disappear.|Rotten
This oft-told tale (this is the fourth telling of the story) falls into an all-too-predictable rhythm in the middle of the movie, which becomes a slog in the third and final act.|Rotten
The first half of this new take on the story is incredible.|Fresh
I believed Bradley Cooper was a man who writes Soundgarden songs but dresses like Sturgill Simpson. I believed Lady Gaga was Joe Biden's daughter. I never wanted it to end.|Fresh
It's all a bit overamped, an entertainment that's a little too in love with itself to bring down the curtain -- even as its two-hour and 15-minute length begins to wear.|Rotten
"This fourth rendition better be the last because you can't really step it up from here. If you aren't a ""Little Monster"" by now, ""A Star is Born"" will convert you."|Fresh
Here we have a film that is as accomplished as they come; a muscular, note-perfect, old-fashioned, cinematic event that longs to be experienced on the big screen - preferably, one with a stellar sound system.|Fresh
Gaga is so good in A Star Is Born and on so many levels that she single-handedly justifies its existence.|Fresh
It's the love story for our time. It's an instant cult classic. It's everything a tasteful move should not be, and yet it's an undeniable success.|Fresh
The high-voltage ghost of Judy Garland haunts every frame and illuminates every shadow in the film, and Lady Gaga seems to know it.|Fresh
The film's musical scene are truly sensational. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A Star is Re-Born? This is the 4th time this one has been made and it's still more a star is boring than A Star is Born.|Rotten
Cooper's gamble - both in stepping in behind the camera and giving Lady Gaga her first starring film role - has paid off handsomely.|Fresh
Cooper, Lady Gaga shine in tragic story of love, addiction.|Fresh
The elegance with which Bradley Cooper solves the tragic end of the protagonist in his directorial debut seems to anticipate that after this debut there is not only trade, but a truly talent. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
If 2011's The Artist was an homage, this is more of a burlesque, a hot mess of a movie that takes its dramatic cues from the camp excesses of the drag queens among whom our hammered hero finds the lucky Lady.|Rotten
And whatever tears you may shed at the end feel entirely earned, as is one's respect for a movie far better than one might have imagined: a film director is born.|Fresh
"If you've been hearing good things about ""A Star is Born,"" believe them all."|Fresh
It's a film that's wise to what it means to be famous in 2018 as well as old-fashioned movie entertainment, with gangbusters musical numbers and an effective and appealing love story between its two leads. And it will make Lady Gaga a movie star.|Fresh
"The 2018 version of ""A Star Is Born"" is notable because it contains some impressive ""firsts"" for two of our galaxy's brightest performers."|Fresh
Though this may not be much of a shock to longtime fans, for those of us who associate Lady Gaga with outlandish public appearances in meat dresses, her soulful down-to-earth performance in this film is borderline revelatory.|Fresh
"Little jabs of pleasure give way to something less tingly, safer: nods of admiration. Torquing Susan Sontag's definition of camp as ""seriousness that fails,"" I think of Cooper's movie as seriousness that succeeds, but perhaps too well or too cleanly."|Rotten
Songs age, too, into eulogies for euphoria or suicide notes for security. They die. They're reborn. Over and over. That sense of decay and renewal boldly rests deep in the bones, performances and storytelling of one of the year's best films.|Fresh
Lady Gaga is a radiant, natural actor, and she knocks her first lead movie performance way-far out of the park.|Fresh
[Their love] shines through the performances and music with relevant lyrics proving crucial to their characters' mindsets and our emotional reaction to what occurs.|Fresh
Believe some, not all, of the hype.|Fresh
Cooper takes us along for an engaging ride. And one filled with solid direction, even better performances from the leads, and a killer soundtrack featuring some incredible new songs. (Full Content Review - Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Bradley Cooper outshines Lady Gaga in competent retread.|Fresh
I will go out on a short limb to predict Academy Award nods to Cooper, Gaga and Elliott. Lady Gaga's days of wearing a meat dress are history. A born movie star is she.|Fresh
I can't recommend this film enough and can't imagine anyone not being bowled over by it.|Fresh
This is a dazzlingly original silver-screen debut.|Fresh
Unabashed melodrama...the film's strongest moments are acoustic, not plugged-in...intimate, truth-telling exchanges between lovers who want the best for each other.|Rotten
"""A Star is Born"" dazzles."|Fresh
When this movie really hums, it's about Cooper the actor and director supporting those who are supporting him.|Fresh
In spite of a momentous directorial debut and performance from Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga leaves the lasting impression in A Star Is Born, a beautiful production perfectly suited to re-release the superstar as a top-tier performer.|Fresh
There's a reason they keep making A Star Is Born. As long as you tell this story, you're going to have a good movie. This is not my favorite A Star is Born (that would belong to Barbra) but it's definitely in my top three Star is Borns.|Fresh
"""A Star is Born"" isn't perfect, but what Cooper and Gaga are able to do with the tale make it a delicate love story and triumphant tribute to the artistic spirit."|Fresh
It's so alive with raw heartache and intoxicating performances it feels like a story no one's ever told before.|Fresh
[A] creaking, ego driven and tone deaf musical drama.|Rotten
We're not watching. We're diving in with her - and ascending to an insta-stardom that feels real, not contrived.|Fresh
A perfectly acceptable drama with some great songs and performances but little more.|Fresh
Cooper has managed to do the impossible. He's put together an instant movie classic that will have audiences falling in love with his brand new creation.|Fresh
This movie is an effulgent treat. The songs are terrific and the concert scenes alone are worth the price of admission. Cooper shows Oscar(r) quality as director, actor and co-writer of songs.|Fresh
The good news is that this generation gets a pretty good version of the story.|Fresh
Cooper's leisurely approach builds no momentum, and the non-musical scenes meander as the actors (apparently) improvise in close-up. This isn't storytelling as much as it is a work-shopped series of behaviors.|Rotten
It is maudlin, earnest and unfashionably melodramatic. It is too long. It is self-serious. And it is really, truly great.|Fresh
Perhaps this is one of those songs that's been sung once or twice too often.|Rotten
Were the actor Bradley Cooper not so tender and hard-working in his performance as the jaded rocker Jackson Maine, it would be possible to regard the whole thing as a vanity project, since he co-wrote and directed it also.|Fresh
It's Cooper's first time as director and Gaga's first major movie role, but you'd never guess it from the skill and passion they bring to the project.|Fresh
In A Star Is Born, love hurts. But it's labor that breaks your heart.|Fresh
This A Star Is Born is like movie night at the rehab clinic: all the shame of drunkenness and none of the elation.|Rotten
With A Star Is Born, Lady Gaga nails those 12 notes. And she takes it up a key, too.|Fresh
When you go into seeing A Star Is Born, one thing is always clear: You're in for great music and a broken heart.|Fresh
Lady Gaga delivers a movie musical performance that's fresh, funny, and at times powerful.|Fresh
Everything feels comfortably familiar, yet halfway through this plate of pleasing nostalgia and orchestrated pathos, you realize there's not much substance between the focaccia. We may love our two leads but their characters never feel entirely developed.|Fresh
A Star is Born is American mainstream cinema at its very finest.|Fresh
Lady Gaga supplies an astonishing work of transparent, transporting joy, a frayed electrical wire of emotion with the voice of an earthy angel. She complements Cooper's sexy, sensitive, pugnacious and powerful Star is Born.|Fresh
For Cooper, it's a polished directorial debut. For Gaga, it's as comfortable a bridge from pop stardom into the movie world as one could imagine. As duets go, that's the sort of combined star power that's difficult to beat.|Fresh
But, but, but... I did cry, and Lady Gaga is truly sensational, fabulous, a revelation. I had no idea.|Fresh
A Star is Born isn't a perfect movie, but it is a darned entertaining one.|Fresh
The result is a richly layered, laugh-and-cry love story that understands that audiences must love the characters before they buy their love affair.|Fresh
This is the best work Cooper has done as an actor since The Silver Linings Playbook, and his directorial debut suggests the brightest of futures behind the lens. As for Gaga, well, she steals the show.|Fresh
The glory of this version of A Star Is Born is in how this movie star is born through the deconstruction of the pop star playing her.|Fresh
[Gag's] enchanting to watch, while the chemistry between her and Cooper is mesmerising. You'll fall in love with them falling in love and that goes a long way in carrying you through the movie's slightly sketchier second half.|Fresh
Having already established himself as one of the best actors of his day, Cooper outdoes himself here, performing additional roles behind the scenes. None of his tasks are given short shrift, and his casting of Lady Gaga leads to an inspired performance.|Fresh
Cooper has produced a film worthy of the moniker A STAR IS BORN, both for him as first-time director and Lady Gaga for her first starring role. They are marvelous --- and a whole new generation will get to appreciate this classic tale.|Fresh
Beautifully acted and intelligently written, A STAR IS BORN is an ambitious, even monumental achievement in filmmaking.|Fresh
What prevails is a commitment to the material that goes well beyond vanity-project interests, as well as a dogged affection for these two flickering flames that burned more brightly as one.|Fresh
Lady Gaga, remarkable in her first leading movie role, charms as the pre-fame Ally and deftly portrays her transformation. Her mighty pipes leave no question regarding Ally's talent.|Fresh
Whatever my feelings about the overall plot, at least I found this new iteration well-directed and -acted ... Count this qualified appreciated as a semi-endorsement, then.|Fresh
He's [Cooper] left all of that passion on the screen and once the credits roll, you know exactly why it was worth touching this material again.|Fresh
This is the kind of movie everybody says they don't make anymore.|Fresh
The role of Ally is so meta as to cast doubt on whether Lady Gaga can play other kinds of parts; the performance is so galvanizing that you don't remotely care.|Fresh
It feels somehow compact despite its sprawling two-hour-and-15-minute size, with nary a scene or frame wasted as it builds to its inexorable yet heart-shattering finale.|Fresh
(Cooper) continually - and wisely - puts her in the spotlight, allowing the camera to caress Gaga. Many times Cooper tracks his camera in on Gaga's face, emphasizing her eyes, which - in this case - are windows to her soul.|Fresh
Achingly honest.|Fresh
An impressive debut from Cooper, not only for his direction but also how he elevates himself as an actor to keep up with his perfectly cast co-star.|Fresh
It's no surprise that Gaga shines brightest when she's performing, but that's not just because she's got a generational voice.|Fresh
This is a walking, talking, singing, and a note for note cliché. I enjoyed it, yes, but the beats, the aching melodrama, cornball lines, passages and action are past their prime. They missed a great opportunity to show some originality.|Rotten
As well as turning Gaga into the next hot big screen commodity, Cooper crafts a film that shines brightest when it needs to, ending on a stirring, emotionally-captivating and indescribably powerful note.|Fresh
Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it's also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.|Fresh
Just TV-commercial pathos and huggy redemption.|Rotten
A Star Is Born is a good show. But it's not blazingly original or truly transcendent. We hear the echoes of what came before.|Fresh
For all the predictions I've heard about this latest version being either great or terrible, I have to say it lands in between, though thankfully much closer to the former than the latter.|Fresh
A Star is Born is a series of cliches that work well together. When the music is playing and Cooper and Gaga sing, it's magic.|Fresh
A remarkable, addictive piece of Hollywood myth-making that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen and in the loudest theater possible.|Fresh
This is the best Star Is Born yet, and one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
A Star Is Born is perfectly fine, escapist entertainment. Just don't expect any encores.|Fresh
An astonishingly confident directorial debut from Cooper. The concert scenes are alternatively soulful and boot-stomping, but never anything less than arresting, and the snippets of backstage life crackle with authenticity.|Fresh
Cooper and Gaga both infuse an energy and authenticity within [their characters] that gives their blossoming relationship organic growth.|Fresh
In the next A Star Is Born we surely need a story reborn. This one is getting past its reincarnate-by date.|Rotten
A Star Is Born, is simply terrific -- a big-scale cinematic delight that will have the masses singing, swooning and sobbing along with it.|Fresh
...an all-out weepie, and something of a false one.|Fresh
Cooper and Gaga have voices worth listening to, especially when they're harmonizing in front of a crowd of thousands. We just wish the narrative mixed in a few more sharps and flats to ensure a clearly distinct sound and experience.|Fresh
"What ultimately makes ""A Star Is Born"" such a pleasure is that it works on every level - the direction, the acting, the music, the casting."|Fresh
First-time director Cooper and co-star Gaga make beautiful music together in this glossy update of a Hollywood classic.|Fresh
For the movie to work, the music has to be believable as commercially viable entity, and for the most part it does.|Fresh
Every generation needs its Star, and the latest version - starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga - is a worthwhile addition to the series.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper has a lot to say in this effective, beautifully made movie.|Fresh
No acting is required from Cooper and the accompanying band when [Lady Gaga] takes the stage. Like them, you will be in awe.|Fresh
Even the most hard-hearted and cynical viewer is likely to have an emotional reaction, and this is as much a testimony to the way Cooper tells the tale as to the story itself.|Fresh
Cooper deserves the accolades, but it's Gaga people will be talking about as they leave the theater.|Fresh
Cooper's version of Star is like a perfect white t-shirt or a nice bowl spaghetti.|Fresh
A blockbuster romance that looks and feels like an indie film, all in service of an expression of pure love.|Fresh
Gaga is a real surprise in a demanding role. She never feels like she's acting, and brings the character right into the songs.|Fresh
It's a story of rock stars and A-list fame told in small moments and claustrophobic shouting matches, an epic made small to moving effect.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born is brazen widescreen craft that goes for the throat and makes no bones about wanting to leave you a sopping wet mass of tears by the time its credits roll.|Fresh
The fact that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga have such a good contrast, is worth every second on film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The actors' support for each other translates on screen as real communion and their musical performances together are the film's highlight.|Fresh
The meandering narrative lays a near flawless foundation for a love story centered around finding one's artistic soul.|Fresh
A Star is Born is aptly titled--Lady Gaga has arrived. A movie star is born.|Fresh
Like Barbra Streisand and Whitney Houston before her, Gaga is on her way to becoming more than just a singer who occasionally acts.|Fresh
The result is a product formatted for fans of the Grammys and the Oscars, but it also lets us see the annoying narcissistic drive of its director and protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
"Passionate, emotional and fearless, the gangbusters ""A Star Is Born"" is poised to become the movie of the moment - the one everyone has to see right now."|Fresh
By dumping the usual Hollywood bull for something that feels raw, scrappy and lived in, Cooper and Gaga knock it out of the park. Their movie, one of the year's very best, is a modern musical classic. The Oscar race is officially on.|Fresh
The film feels fresh from thunderous start to exquisite finish.|Fresh
"Cooper and his cast and crew aim high and almost hits the mark but, to me, falls short of its aspiration to be the best ""A Star Is Born."""|Fresh
Cooper's debut outing at the helm is a thoroughly convincing one in almost every respect. In terms of chemistry, a rich natural register is struck between the duo that makes them transfixing to behold.|Fresh
I was blown away by the stellar performances and the original takes on the story|Fresh
Like a classic love song, the film is meant to tug your heart strings. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[A] magnificent, emotional, beautiful production that entertains and thrills you while it makes you laugh and cheer, but also while it makes you cry and breaks your heart.|Fresh
The story may be more than a little hoary but at its best moments, it reminds you that just because something is old and predictable does not mean that it cannot also be entertaining and ultimately satisfying as well.|Fresh
"Lady Gaga has traveled by egg, donned skirt steak and taken part in a TV blood orgy. But her biggest transformation occurs in the new film ""A Star Is Born."" In it, she becomes an Oscar-worthy actress."|Fresh
I just loved it. It's a film that combines an overall feeling of modernity and relevance with the glow of old-time glamour.|Fresh
Instantly sweeps us up in its passion, its electricity, its music, and characters to fall in love with. Lady Gaga is a revelation. It's impossible to believe Bradley Cooper has never directed before. I adore this movie.|Fresh
Somehow, Cooper has made a Hollywood fairy tale seem utterly believable and magical at the same time.|Fresh
Cooper, in his directing debut, puts us inside the music and the drama and lets it swirl around us.|Fresh
It is made for a big screen, big sound and the comforting sorrow of the communal sob.Maybe we really do need another version of A Star is Born.|Fresh
"With their phenomenal ""A Star Is Born,"" Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper upend expectations and spectacularly freshen up a stock Hollywood story."|Fresh
... this update of the classic love story is crafted with a palpable affection and passion. Cooper's take is personal, ingenious, and raw.|Fresh
The result is pure Saturday-night moviegoing: it gives you one hell of a wallop, then you wake up on Sunday morning without a scratch.|Fresh
Lady Gaga excels as a diluted version of herself in a moving a promising directorial debut from powerhouse Bradley Cooper. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Bradley Cooper updates ""A Star Is Born"" on the wings of a luminous talent. Pop diva Lady Gaga is electric on screen."|Fresh
Sit back, fall in love, and let it wash over you. Watch a star being born|Fresh
This version stands on its own. It is enjoyable romp and there are some emotional moments that deliver a jolt but that is it. I wish Hollywood studios would stop with the remakes.|Fresh
A Star Is Born is a resounding success. The concert scenes are particularly impressive... It's intimate, and sweaty, and loud.|Fresh
Fueled by strong performances and Cooper's precise direction, A Star is Born is a moving (and tear-jerking) love story by way of showbiz melodrama.|Fresh
Absolutely LOVED this. Bradley Cooper is just sensational. A juggernaut assault on the emotions. Pack tissues.|Fresh
Musically sharp, dramatically flat|Rotten
An enormously satisfying and well-tuned blockbuster gala musical; a vibrant, up-to-date Supertrouper crackling with happiness and heartbreak, sprinkled with stardust and star-maker gumption.|Fresh
This film grapples with fame, family, integrity, love and sacrifice. It succeeed emphatically in conveying the overwhelming love its two central characters feel.|Fresh
What makes Cooper so good is that he directs in a way that encourages you not to see what he is doing, but what is happening. Character above all.|Fresh
"""Joanne"" demonstrated [Gaga's] range as a vocalist and musician, yet received largely middling reviews. But it did hint at her potential legacy-evolving into an artist as skilled as Prince. A STAR IS BORN cements that legacy."|Fresh
"Handsomely mounted and profoundly felt at times, becoming an ""Actors Studio: The Movie"" take on music world misery."|Fresh
It's full of old-fashioned movie magic, with Bradley Cooper knocking it out of the park in his directorial debut, and Lady Gaga bringing it, and not just with her singing.|Fresh
The first half is much better than the second half, but it still works as a compelling romantic tragedy.|Fresh
"""A Star is Born"" offers a suitably jaundiced glimpse of starmaking machinery at its most cynical, but also its most thrilling and gratifying."|Fresh
Not unlike Boogie Nights, the highs in A Star Is Born (ie: the first half) are very high, while the lows (the latter half) include drawn-out and repetitive elements that are so telegraphed and predictable they simply feel sad.|Fresh
This soul-baring, emotionally propulsive work proves that Cooper is just as much of a dynamo behind the camera as he is in front of it.|Fresh
Lady Gaga can act, very well, and actor Bradley Cooper can direct -- even better.|Fresh
An uneven work of startling sincerity and disarming beauty.|Fresh
The excitement of the film's first hour is sacrificed for a more cliched permanent stay in its second. Gaga takes over and Bradley takes a backseat; gone is the dynamic that made the first half so electrifying and enticing|Rotten
Somewhere inside this good 135-minute film is an even better 120-minute movie.|Fresh
Cooper and Gaga are irresistibly charming together consistently bringing out the best in each other, eliciting palpable trust both as on-screen characters and world-class stars comfortable in one another's shoes. Nothing is faked, everything is remarkable|Fresh
Bradley Cooper's feature directorial debut, A Star Is Born, knocks it out of the park thanks to a stellar performance from Lady Gaga.|Fresh
The kind of film that no one is going to stop talking about for months, because very few people will have anything bad to say about it.|Fresh
Maybe we've seen it before, heard the music and felt how love burns, how inescapable self-destruction hurts. But there's no taking away from what the marriage of these moments has created, the importance of all these new stars shining so bright.|Fresh
While it's not a perfect film - though the first hour just may be - A Star Is Born boasts more than enough passion to make up for some of its narrative hiccups.|Fresh
"""All you gotta do is trust me,"" he tells her, and when he brings her out on stage, and then brings her up to the front microphone, it raises the same kind of gooseflesh as the ""When Your Mind's Made Up"" scene in Once."|Fresh
Cooper's feat of filmmaking puts him on a par with great American actors turned auteurs like Clint Eastwood and Warren Beatty.|Fresh
"Proves there is still plenty of life left in this tale of fame, addiction, and sacrifice. ""A Star Is Born"" is an emotionally intimate journey that makes itself feel like an event. An astonishing Lady Gaga positively soars."|Fresh
Lady Gaga will get the attention, but Bradley Cooper steals the show.|Fresh
Gaga keeps the film's heart pumping. She's down-to-Earth and radiant-in other words, every bit as good as everyone has been saying.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are this year's Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.|Fresh
Cooper gives his heroes highly personal issues: his sanity and his music for Jack, and her sense of self-worth for Ally.|Fresh
The supporting roles in A Star Is Born are equally wonderful, and some in surprising ways. Sam Elliott remains a genius.|Fresh
Lady Gaga triumphs as a young woman averse to artifice and fame-hounding. The movie is a hell of a magic act.|Fresh
Overall, this movie is a testament to the talent of Cooper, but the glory belongs to Gaga.|Fresh
A Star Is Born is a refreshing take of this classic showbiz rise and fall tale, with updated character work, fantastic performances by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, and a soundtrack that will be stuck in your head for days.|Fresh
A Star is Born doesn't deviate too wildly from the frequently remade storyline, but everything else about Cooper's film feels refreshed and new.|Fresh
Gaga is truly immense throughout, delivering a wonderfully grounded and subtle performance with bursts of that electricity that has so invigoratingly defined her pop career.|Fresh
It's valid to ask whether a movie needs to be made a fourth time, but Cooper's fantastic, emotional film demonstrates how execution, style, and a modern point of view can make even the most familiar story fresh again.|Fresh
"A turn that has a semblance of Nicolas Cage in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and Joaquin Phoenix in ""Walk the Line,"" Cooper constructs his own creation, echoing and respecting the role that has been crafted by March, Mason, and Kristofferson."|Fresh
It's not adding anything new to the Star is Born canon, but it is a solid retelling for a new generation.|Fresh
Their chemistry is undeniable, their duets infectious and moving the action into the contemporary music scene, where Ally is rapidly reconfigured as a sequin-studded red head flanked by unnecessary dancers, strikes a long line of emotional notes.|Fresh
You can see where all of it is headed from two miles away. But that doesn't matter, not when Bradley Cooper is executing the formula so well.|Fresh
Cooper and Lady Gaga pull off a remarkable feat-they not only make you believe the characters are actually falling in love.|Fresh
An invigorating paean to the joys of making art, the momentum that comes with sudden inspiration, and how swooningly romantic it can all feel.|Fresh
A film that dares to go big, bold and sincere, classical, modern and haphazard in equal measures. It may not go down as one of the greats but like many a song over the decades, when the right note in the film swings big, it soars.|Fresh
Great music, great performances, a doomed love story with plenty of heart on display, A Star Is Born really is a triumph, a reminder that sometimes playing the hits can really bring the house down.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper makes an outstanding directorial debut and Lady Gaga proves herself a movie star in this electrifying remake of an oft-told show-business tale.|Fresh
Superb. Gaga and Cooper deliver Oscar-worthy turns in a remake that hits the high notes.|Fresh
Cooper's film proves that a love story this timeless still works when done right.|Fresh
It's remarkable... just how many fresh reserves of emotion Cooper teases out of a well-worn formula.|Fresh
Cooper uses Hollywood's favorite creation myth to recreate how audiences will forever perceive him and Gaga.|Fresh
Cooper seems at once fired up by the meet-cute potential of the premise, which he nails, and stuck at a creative crossroads with the more melancholy, sepia-toned stuff that probably first drew the previously-attached Clint Eastwood's attention.|Rotten
The film is a proper double hander, divided between Gaga and Cooper, but it also provides an excellent platform for Cooper to show off all the directorial tricks he's picked up from his long acting career.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper makes an impressive directing debut with A Star Is Born, turning one of Hollywood's most re-made movies into something fresh and soulful, even though it's hampered by some of the story's clichés.|Fresh
Believe the hype. Cooper is a born director and Lady Gaga is superb.|Fresh
This story has been told several times before-and influenced other similar romances-but Cooper and Gaga find a way to make this feel fresh and new.|Fresh
The familiar story of an aging performer discovering a rising star gets a fresh coat of paint, and excels primarily due to the performance (and musical talents) of Lady Gaga.|Fresh
Cooper has made a remarkably self-assured feature debut anchored by an outstanding lead performance from Lady Gaga.|Fresh
The occasional bum note aside, this is broad-strokes filmmaking of the highest calibre.|Fresh
What Bradley Cooper has done here as an actor and director is truly remarkable.|Fresh
The hype for this movie is already through the roof, and all I can say is it lives up to it.|Fresh
Gaga's easy, offhanded command of the screen matches up well with Cooper's sincere, straight-ahead portrayal of a good man undermining his own talent.|Fresh
Although the path that A Star is Born treads is well worn, there's a raw honesty to the central relationship that Cooper taps into here, elevating the material far beyond the Glitters of this world by bringing out the very best in both himself and Gaga.|Fresh
Yes, you've seen this movie before. It worked then, it works now. Maybe it's never worked better.|Fresh
When it hits its highest, most resonant notes, Bradley Cooper's remake of A Star Is Born achieves a triumphant, romantic ache that is often just what we want to experience at the movies.|Fresh
Bradley Cooper understands that a message is only as resonant as its messenger, so he surrounds himself with collaborators, old and new, who can sell even the hoariest cliché.|Fresh
I wasn't ready for the level of storytelling that was this complex and a deliciously riveting addition to the A Star is Born legacy.|Fresh
Lady Gaga comes in hard with her big-screen debut and knocks it out of the park.|Fresh
This may be the fourth version of this film and story but it forges its own path, on its own terms and is vibrant, personal and raw in its examination of celebrity, romance and the cost of fame, love and, addiction.|Fresh
A remake that captures the tone and spirit of prior films, A Star Is Born still blazes its own heartfelt, authentic path.|Fresh
A Star is Born is devoid of depth. It feels like a missed opportunity, since its core subject offers many cues to tell a contemporary story.|Rotten
Cooper is an unabashed Old Hollywood lover, and he makes an unabashed stab at this material - which is why it works. It's fun to see the hat tips.|Fresh
Cooper has succeeded in giving this dinosaur of a film stomping new life. This is A Star Is Born re-made for the age of the talent contest.|Fresh
Cooper's screen chemistry with Lady Gaga is another significant problem. They're great on stage together but in scenes with dialogue they're worlds apart, in apparently different movies.|Rotten
What keeps the film from feeling like a mere rehash is the gut-level romanticism of it all.|Fresh
Gaga is appealing, open and down-to-earth in her first major role.|Fresh
"Calling the new A Star Is Born a ""valentine"" from its star, Lady Gaga, to her fans sounds a bit coy and delicate, so let's call it what it really is: a hot French kiss (with full-on tongue), filled with passion, tears and a staggering amount of chutzpah."|Fresh
Credit to Cooper for delivering his best, most soulful performance while pulling double duty behind the camera, but it's his co-star whose magnetism most draws you into their world - and keeps you there even when the film hits the occasional wrong note.|Fresh
Cooper proves a good cover can work just as well as the original.|Fresh
This utter ludicrousness has all the hallmarks of reality television... but Cooper is so heartfelt in his direction and performance, while [Lady Gaga] has a credibly wonderful voice, so the fairytale feels true.|Fresh
Pop diva Lady Gaga gives a perfectly creditable performance opposite Bradley Cooper (who also directs) in the latest version of old Hollywood chestnut, A Star Is Born, but this still feels like an unnecessary remake.|Fresh
A Star is Born features great performances all around, but the star that is truly born here is Bradley Cooper as a director.|Fresh
A Star Is Born tries very, very hard to be the most emotional movie of 2018. I'm not convinced it wins on that front, but I can say it gets the prize for most hysterical melodrama. Take it as a compliment.|Fresh
Star is less a story now than a myth - not so much reborn as recast, and passed on to the care of the next generation.|Fresh
Cooper and Lady Gaga are dynamite together; this is a story that lives and dies by the central relationship and the instant chemistry that must blossom between them, and these two have it in spades.|Fresh
The story of A Star Is Born may be as old as show-business, but it is also electrifyingly fresh - a well-known melody given vivid, searching new force.|Fresh
Outrageously watchable and colossally enjoyable... supercharged with dilithium crystals of pure melodrama.|Fresh
As an unashamedly anachronistic attempt to muster the emotional intensity of the Hollywood melodrama tradition, Cooper's film must be at least grudgingly acknowledged as a success. And both stars, Gaga in particular, emerge with honour.|Fresh
You come away feeling something for these people, flawed individuals who are trying to hold their cracked pieces of self together-or to mend the cracks of those they love.|Fresh
The real surprise here is not Cooper, but Gaga. More than a newly born star, hers never stops growing.|Fresh
This is a durable tale of romance, heady fame and crushing tragedy, retold for a new generation with heart and grit.|Fresh
"""A Star Is Born"" is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie."|Fresh
This is the fourth iteration of A Star Is Born, and even if you haven't seen the previous versions, the formula will be familiar.|Rotten
An example of Big Movie Studio Craft at its most well-thought out; among the many contingents of moviegoers it will please will be the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' crowd.|Fresh
