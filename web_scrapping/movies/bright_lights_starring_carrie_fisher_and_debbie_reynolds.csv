Bright Lights is a heartbreaking tribute to a singular mother-daughter relationship.|Fresh

It was a fascinating documentary before, but now it's a treasure.|Fresh
The film may not be revelatory as an expose of two Hollywood icons, but as a celebration of love and resilience as captured in the smallest moments of their lives, it is remarkable.|Fresh
Bright Lights is way too short, probably. I could have watched these two across a movie twice as long. They're clearly more interesting than just about every other celebrity (two-bit of legitimate) who allows cameras to follow their day to day lives.|Fresh
It captures these two extremely vital spirits in the very recent past, and makes you feel the loss of them even more sharply.|Fresh
These scrappy survivors are great company, for each other and for their admirers who will treasure this glimpse into their private and professional lives.|Fresh

[Bright Lights] deepens our understanding of who these people were, why they mattered and what their oft-examined and perhaps misunderstood bond might have been really all about.|Fresh
Thanks to its stars, and the work of directors Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens, it's peppy, wistful, and a little transgressive all at once.|Fresh
Both camps will find much to move them in Bright Lights, especially the profound bond between its subjects and the obstacles that were overcome to make it last.|Fresh
This new documentary about Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher celebrates them in hilarious and heart-stirring fashion.|Fresh
A beauty that will mostly make you laugh and, of course, cry.|Fresh
"Self-deprecating bon mots, wordplay, song lyrics and perfectly timed occasional moans are what elevate this beyond simple ""Keeping Up With"" material."|Fresh
Even without the sadness that now floods Bright Lights, it would still be a classic of its kind.|Fresh
If Bright Lights is, at times, a sharp reminder of what's been lost, it's also convincing evidence that wherever Fisher and Reynolds are now, they're almost certainly together.|Fresh
Both women shine so brightly here - apart but especially together - that it drives home the enormity of their absence.|Fresh
It's a melancholy final visit in light of the recent death of both its subjects. But it's still a rare chance for viewers to sneak behind those weird, eccentric compound gates, and hang out as if they were part of the family.|Fresh
Now that they're gone, the film instantly becomes the loveliest farewell gift.|Fresh
What would have been a straightforward, reality TV-esque insight into two very interesting women is elevated beyond measure by the recent tragedy of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds' deaths.|Fresh
A tender, human, and very, very funny portrait of Hollywood royalty.|Fresh
Simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking ...|Fresh
"""...two people who loved each other so much they couldn't spend even a day apart."""|Fresh
The real reason to watch Bright Lights is for the scenes between Fisher and Reynolds; some are priceless.|Fresh
t's a beautifully filmed, whip-smart, perfectly edited love letter to a legendary mother-daughter duo that respects and honors their relationship without sugarcoating their troubled and checkered history.|Fresh
It's a raw, revealing, hairy-warts-and-all look inside their lives and the Beverly Hills compound... they shared. And it serves as a fitting eulogy for both, only occasionally coming across as more heartbreaking than heartwarming.|Fresh
Bright Lights not only captures the unique nature of their bond -- forged, as it was, under such intense scrutiny -- but what made them special, both individually and together.|Fresh
Bright Lights, an affectionate and intimate documentary produced and directed by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens, gives a more balanced view of one of show business's famous mother-daughter duos.|Fresh
Even if [both subjects] hadn't died within a day of each other last week, Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds would have been a lovely, bittersweet portrait of a complicated yet unusually devoted mother-daughter relationship.|Fresh
You leave the movie wanting so much more of [Fisher], it hurts.|Fresh
The film is surprisingly revealing, given the fact that its two subjects, in both similar and individual ways, are playing for the audience.|Fresh
A wonderfully entertaining program, Bright Lights shows just how close the mother and daughter had become in recent years... that vaguely brings to mind Grey Gardens without the fallen-from-grace squalor.|Fresh
The film is an appealing intermingling of Reynolds's old Hollywood sensibilities, including her storehouse of movie collectibles and her always-exquisite hair and makeup, and Fisher's gonzo, therapized, contemporary Hollywood wit.|Fresh
"""Bright Lights"" captures the essence of what they had together - not just a bond but a mother-daughter marriage. One that lasted two lifetimes."|Fresh
There are worse ways to spend 95 minutes than in the company of two people you like, admire, and are enduringly charmed by.|Fresh
The resiliency of the Reynolds tribe-mother and both children-is what makes the movie such a fascinating, voyeuristic view into Hollywood mythmaking.|Fresh
What the film is really about is the bond between a mother and daughter who through it all can still bring a little joy into each others lives and the daughter who is holding onto that moment as long as she can.|Fresh
If the film is as disorderly in its structure as the messy family history it surveys, time spent with these wonderful subjects makes that seem sweetly appropriate.|Fresh
This touching love story - with each other, the past, and the camera - has clear appeal, to 'Old Hollywood' fans, to Star Wars followers, to voyeurs in general.|Fresh
