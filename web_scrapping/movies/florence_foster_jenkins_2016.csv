The vivacity of the portrait and the era, and that comedy from when the good lady starts singing, help to understand the character a lot. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Predominantly schmaltzy but sporadically affecting...|Rotten
For as great as Meryl is, Florence Foster Jenkins once again illustrates how Streep's game is raised when she is with the right people.|Fresh
Brilliant crowd pleasing biopic with enough drama and humor to entertain and break your heart.|Fresh
It is a measure of Nicholas Martin's fine script that he introduces us to Florence's marriage slowly, recognising it as almost a character in its own right with many a layer to be peeled back.|Fresh
Stellar performances from the unlikely pairing of Streep and Grant, and the awkwardly charming performance from Helberg bring to life a symphonic story of eccentricity and love.|Fresh
The reason why Foster Jenkins is so charming,... is that she was so blissfully and sincerely unaware of herself and her lack of talent.|Fresh
There's an inescapable sense of sadness that all of Florence's charm and resources are wasted in chasing after wind.|Fresh

In her four-decade, 64-film career, La Streep has rarely hit a wrong note. She's making up for lost time. And the discordance is delicious.|Fresh
(Grant) gives a properly mature performance that is everything that Streep's is not -- subtle, nuanced and emotionally complex.|Fresh
"More than anything, Florence Foster Jenkins feels like Baby Boomer version of ""everybody gets a participation trophy""."|Rotten
Jenkins' singing may be horrendously off-key, but together Grant and Streep hit all the right notes and deliver a harmonious and often hilarious performance.|Fresh
The actress takes to the delusional singer con brio, as they say. The result is like being fed too much screaming cake.|Rotten
This movie sings, even when its heroine can't.|Fresh
A joyous production which emotional side is reinforced by Meryl Streep's performance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins is the latest Meryl Streep summer comedy, and it's a pleasant, and at times touching little gem based on a true story.|Fresh
Even though there's no real story to speak of, I enjoyed Florence Foster Jenkins because it has gorgeous period costumes and wonderful performances.|Fresh
You will never get bored with this simple,digestible and very entertaining biopic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A family entertainment film, with good moral and a performance from Meryl Streep that could give her an Oscar nomination. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It would be so easy to make Florence the butt of the joke, the victim of an elaborate prank perpetrated by a slice of New York society feeding her delusions, but her story borders on tragedy...|Fresh
A solid film with great secondary performances where Meryl Streep truly shines. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Streep has a ball, wearing extravagant dresses and performing excruciatingly badly on stage. Yet she does not play Jenkins as a lamentable, pitiful figure, instead portraying her as a self-aware exhibitionist who chooses to ignore the bad vibes.|Fresh
Perhaps it doesn't add up to much but it's lovely to look at and touching.|Fresh
A delightful comedy told with great taste, in which Meryl Streep stands out of course. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With Streep on grandstanding form and Grant given a rare chance to show his range, this is an intelligent dramedy that moves and amuses.|Fresh
This is an often hilarious film, but it flattens out.|Fresh
Brilliant Streep wails hilariously and Grant bumbles expertly as Frears turns a true story into an old-fashioned farce. But it's the film's emotional beats that really make it sing.|Fresh
The cast and the firm hand of its director are the main ingredients of the film, and if it were not enough, it has an excellent atmosphere and costumes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Is Florence Foster Jenkins a proper film or a blooperish three-minute X Factor audition, spun out over two insufferably camp hours?|Rotten
Florence Foster Jenkins is a fairy tale of glorious optimism and unclouded love.|Fresh
Streep walks a careful line between Jenkins' silliness and her worthy heart. Florence Foster Jenkins would lose its appeal quickly if she were merely a woman with a fat purse and a lousy voice.|Fresh
A tender and entertaining film with an amazing staging, amazing performances. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With a wonderful art direction, the excellent musical contribution of Alexandre Desplat and the amazing chemistry between Streep and Grant make this film a real treat for the eyes and ears. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A very insipid movie based on a extraordinary true story. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The primary emotion in this warmly rendered and often funny comedy is affection, for the subject of this biopic and her peculiarly child-like way of seeing the world.|Fresh
There are humorous moments and moments of poignancy.|Fresh
The truth is that we come out of the film respecting how much the two main characters love each other, but their characters have not been enough filled out for us to be very touched by their love.|Fresh
Streep's broad, entertaining performance anchors a serviceable film about the age-old problem of what happens when ambition exceeds ability.|Fresh
Unsurprisingly, Streep hits all the right - or should that be wrong? - notes, with a marvellously tragi-comic turn.|Fresh
An uneven but most pleasant comical biopic on the delusional American heiress opera singer and philanthropist Florence Foster Jenkins.|Fresh
Not a happy portrait of a figure unburdened by the hard edge of criticism; it is a sad retelling, showing a woman who used the stage as a means to silence the nagging alarms of her demise.|Fresh
Streep's take on the character is so assured that we can't help but admire her determination and panache, even as it makes her a fool in the eyes of others|Fresh
...at a time of near-record income inequality ... is there anything to celebrate in this kind of fantasy-making?|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins is a wonderful and strange period comedy, where Meryl Streep once again raises all material at hand and steals your heart. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins is one of the better films of the year.|Fresh
Streep and Grant are amazing both when they're apart and together, their earnest portrayals really lending gravitas to people who would otherwise be remembered as a joke|Fresh
Streep is fun to watch, singing badly and being oblivious to her headache inducing sounds. Hugh Grant is also quite good, making sure Florence lives a sheltered life and never finds out the truth that her voice stinks.|Fresh
A multi-leveled love story about a passionate lover of music who can't sing.|Fresh
With the aid of director Stephen Frears, Streep rises above her text and manages to earn the sympathy Martin so clumsily demands for her.|Fresh
[It's] a fact-based tale that doesn't have all that much to say. But it does have a very entertaining way of saying it.|Fresh
The film is a comedy with harrowing undertones. Frears and his screenwriter Nicholas Martin want us to laugh at Florence, yet adore her and support her antics.|Fresh
The film's scolding tone, combined with the sentimental gloss of its ending, leaves an aftertaste that sours the screwball fizz of its cheerier moments.|Rotten
""" . . . the triumph of director Stephen Frears' portrait of the performer, who sadly hit the wall of her own talent long before her passion ran dry, is that it never chooses . . . one pat answer to sum up the ultimate meaning of her career."""|Fresh
There are small aspects of the film to celebrate, despite how overshadowed they are by the toneless script.|Rotten
Despite the gorgeous set designs and attention to detail in every scene, this film still comes through as an ugly affair.|Rotten
Here's a sentence both deliciously implausible and totally true: Meryl Streep nearly has her own movie stolen from her by a cast member from The Big Bang Theory.|Fresh
Pitch perfect costumes and sets make this a delightful trip to 1944 New York and a sweet, if over imaginative, love story.|Fresh
There's no denying that Streep is one of the greatest actresses of our (all?) time, but there's plenty of room to argue that her recent run hasn't been as astounding as past laps of victory. With Florence Foster Jenkins, she returns in grand fashion.|Fresh
"Streep is game, but the material is just lame. And that's what makes ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" every bit as tone deaf as its subject."|Rotten
Meryl Streep (of course) delivers yet another solid performance, but Florence Foster Jenkins gets a bit too lost in the balancing act between comedy and drama to emerge a bonafide winner.|Rotten
Streep never struggles to find the pitch, which almost makes the film's schizophrenic tone seem normal...maybe a song doesn't have to be perfectly written, as long as it's sung with feeling.|Fresh
It might sound like a sappy drama about following your dreams, yet the film is a much more complex portrait than that.|Fresh
Warm performances and Frears' deft touch hide lack of substance behind Florence's warbles.|Fresh
It takes a special talent to sing so badly so well, and Streep captures Florence's sincere, yet somehow blissfully ignorant, love for music.|Fresh
It's a terribly difficult movie to dislike while at the same time also an almost equally tough one to embrace with any passion.|Fresh
Streep sings very badly very well.|Fresh
[Streep] can croon a decent tune when she needs to. This role calls for the greater skill of delivering Florence's songs as deliciously badly as Flo did. Result: Meryl is a shoo-in for her 20th Oscar nomination.|Fresh
Stephen Frears has made a likeable, affecting movie, but the film itself could benefit from a little of the tough love that Jenkins never received in her own life.|Fresh
Comical, affectionate and sentimental, Florence Foster Jenkins is a film about a woman who decided she could, so she did.|Fresh
Even if it doesn't touch greatness, it certainly could have been worse, and if Florence Foster Jenkins emphasizes anything, it's that it's not always bad to be bad.|Fresh
It's a credit to Streep, who must be commended for singing badly with such utter conviction, that Florence is never reduced to a tragic figure.|Fresh
An utterly delightful film you can't help but smile at.|Fresh
The more mature patrons of Streep's art are likely to find charm the key selling point of Florence Foster Jenkins, the story of a woman driven by love, and showing us how boundless and fragile some love can be.|Fresh
It's a wobbly, uneven, ultimately wonderful film - its unevenness befitting its title character, who we come to love despite her loopy lack of awareness of her own deficiencies.|Fresh
A film that dares you to give it a bad review, simply so it can turn around and call you a bully who picks on the people who try. It invites you to giggle at Florence's horrible singing and then promptly scolds you for laughing,|Rotten
"This true story, as directed by the usually reliable Stephen Frears (""The Queen,"" ""Philomena"") with period flair showing up once again throughout, simply uh, well . . . never quite hits the proper notes."|Rotten
Charming period comedy may not sing to younger viewers.|Fresh
...it's ultimately impossible to label Florence Foster Jenkins as a anything less than a total misfire that wastes the talents of everyone involved.|Rotten
Fun movie. In real life Meryl Streep is a great singer and it takes a great singer to sing this badly. Wonderful work by Hugh Grant and The Big Bang Theory's Simon Helberg.|Fresh
There are layers in what seems initially like a broad, hooting comic performance from Streep. We get glimpses of the real Florence, who seems too smart with her money not to be able to read the people who ask her for it.|Fresh
Perhaps it takes someone with vocal talent to truly channel terrible singing.|Fresh
Jenkins' story doesn't mean much of anything here.|Rotten
Even... as Streep's face ignites in a glow of deluded rapture, a disquieting sense of guilt creeps over us. We like Florence, and we can't help sharing her husband's dread that some day, somehow, the elaborate jig will be up.|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins is a hoot, but it's also the saddest comedy you'll see this year.|Fresh
Against the odds, Florence Foster Jenkins manages to be a funny and even endearing film. But I kept asking myself, what's it really about?|Fresh
To write that Streep is magnificent would be an understatement. She's as good as she has ever been --- no one can out-nuance her. She holds the screen like no other actor, and she brings Florence to life with a joyful, bigger-than-life verve.|Fresh
So how good is Meryl Streep? Outstanding would be the only word that would do justice to her deceptively happy-go-lucky performance.|Fresh
"""Florence Foster Jenkins"", without much in the way of pithy character development or historical context, comes off as a bit of a repetitive one-note joke. But Streep pulls off the very difficult task of intentionally singing off-key."|Fresh
In Florence Foster Jenkins, the supremely gifted Meryl Streep is playing a supremely ungifted singer with artistic ambitions. It's official: Streep can play anything, even someone without a trace of talent.|Fresh
It's great fun, Streep padded like a battleship, decked out in outlandish yet matronly costumes, abusing our ears to her own merriment.|Fresh
Yes, of course Meryl Streep is excellent as an infamously awful opera singer. It's Hugh Grant who continually surprises in this slight but charming comedy.|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins will strike a chord with those looking for relief in the form of originality, top-tier acting and amazingly godawful singing.|Fresh
'Florence Foster Jenkins' is undoubtedly the best movie of 2016 so far, and seems out of place in-as usual-a summer of comic book superheroes.|Fresh
An entertaining period dramedy. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins isn't perfect; bits of busyness can't disguise its simple arc. But it trips lightly through some pretty profound ideas about power, selfishness, vanity, generosity, and human frailty.|Fresh
If mean words from a critic were so damaging to the artist, I would have killed Rob Schneider years ago.|Rotten
"In real life, Jenkins became famous for her lack of talent. But ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" honors her spirit, which is more powerful than any notes on the musical scale."|Fresh
Wispy and low-key, a little funny but not uproariously so and a little touching but mostly in its home stretch.|Fresh
It's the rare film that discovers dignity in foolishness.|Fresh
Director Frears maintains a quick, frolicsome tone right up until the moment Florence receives her coup de grace, which he delivers with a bold, simple and unexpected shot that's something of a masterstroke.|Fresh
The film champions coddling people like Florence Foster Jenkins and treats critical thinking as the enemy.|Rotten
You have to know how to sing well to sing this badly and you have to be an actor of sublime perfection to make terrible singing funny and brave and poignant.|Fresh
Not quite a sad story, it's not quite a comedy, either. Florence Foster Jenkins will always be a mystery. The best that movie makers can do is present us with her story, and leave us to wonder.|Fresh
Meryl Streep proves that it takes a great performer to play a bad one well in the odd and sweet comedy Florence Foster Jenkins.|Fresh
This movie is afraid of making too much fun of its subject for this and other reasons, and that unfortunately keeps the movie from joining that great tradition of films that pay tribute to the cracked nobility of making bad art.|Rotten
Meryl Streeps turns bad singing into high art as Florence Foster Jenkins in a hilarious and sophisticated movie for grown ups this summer.|Fresh
This scenario reads, in retrospect, as quite sad and pathetic. But this movie plays it mostly for madcap laughs and ultimately tender sympathy for the hapless heroine.|Fresh
If you ever wanted to see Meryl Streep have the time of her life, Florence Foster Jenkins delivers.|Fresh
Ms. Streep is a delight, hilarious when she's singing and convincingly on edge at all times.|Fresh
A damn fine and funny film. Streep could be looking at her 20th Oscar nomination. It's a whole new direction for Grant. And Helberg is irresistible.|Fresh
Streep is splendid in the titular role ... Grant is witty and nuanced, never hitting a false note, as her devoted husband and partner...|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins is ultimately a tale of vulnerability, and a tin ear is the least of it.|Fresh
Meryl Streep is brilliant and the sun is shining on Hugh Grant again. Their performances are extraordinary.|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins is this year's movie that your mom will love which, under its anodyne surface, is actually kind of morally abhorrent.|Rotten
You're never too old to start falling in love with Meryl Streep all over again.|Fresh
Frears works at a frantic pace to get Jenkins from one failed performance to the next. This gives Streep a lot of moments of musical misfortunes but they are delivered in such a helter-skelter manner that each seems little different than the one before.|Rotten
With such a high-powered cast at his disposal, Frears' latest is probably the most fun you'll have at a movie this summer.|Fresh
The movie is a pleaser, for the most part, even though the attitude it takes toward its subject is often problematic.|Fresh
It's a big song in a minor key that nevertheless has a lovely melody.|Fresh
It's a credit to Streep and to filmmaker Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons, The Queen) that you will laugh at the absurdity of Jenkins' situation - but never at the lady herself.|Fresh
...like Ed Wood (1994), it's a movie in which love of art and kindness of heart triumphs over lack of talent.|Fresh
it succinctly and eloquently lays out a story in which the public grows to value the likability and kind heart of the talent more than her actual talent itself.|Fresh
The great gift of this film, of course, is that Streep again completely embodies the character she is playing...but imbues Florence with such empathy, charm, dedication and warmth that we're cheering for her throughout this entire movie.|Fresh
The funny, touching, and even a little bit profound biopic of the world's worst ever opera singer, and the ultimate evidence of the power of Streep.|Fresh
Try not to focus too much on the upbeat message, summarized in 25 words or less at the end, and instead enjoy the simple pleasure of [Jenkins'] company.|Fresh
Even when her notes are intolerably sour, Jenkins's story is never less than touchingly bittersweet.|Fresh
There's too much exquisite period detail and costuming to attend, so many familiar bootstrap musical beats to hit. Florence Foster Jenkins is too much old-fashioned fun to saddle with ideas. Just sit back and let Meryl screech.|Fresh
Guess who's headed for another Oscar nomination.|Fresh
It is, as so many Streep movies seem to be these days, a wonderful performance in a movie that isn't quite as good as she is.|Fresh
The material could have used a full-out comedic plot in the P. G. Wodehouse vein or something slyly sophisticated like Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel. Instead it gets lost in the shallows -- along with Streep's Oscar chances.|Rotten
A real-life screwball comedy with a solid gold cast. Grant may have just sealed his first Oscar nomination.|Fresh
This could have been a great film. Instead, it's just a feel-good one.|Fresh
It's not necessary to be a classical-music buff to be charmed by this thoroughly entertaining film that never hits a false note.|Fresh
It's another showcase for Streep - nothing new on that front, but still enjoyable.|Fresh
It would be easy to mine Jenkins' story for silly farce and 1940s set pieces and let it coast from there, but director Stephen Frears is too kind, and too nuanced, to do that.|Fresh
Director Stephen Frears brings Jenkins' quirky story to the screen with humor as well as heart, never crossing over into camp or parody in a tale that certainly could've gone there.|Fresh
Beautifully crafted and impeccably cast...at once a funny and touching tale of a woman who wouldn't let mere lack of talent destroy her desire to share her love of music with others.|Fresh
[Streep] honors the character's benevolent cluelessness and the melancholy beneath her optimism, and she nails every one of Florence Foster Jenkins' godawful notes with precision. That alone sums up the movie's contradictions.|Fresh
"If you don't confuse this with history - or with the French film ""Marguerite,"" a fictional piece loosely based on FFJ - you'll come away touched. That's mostly because of Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant."|Fresh
Jenkins' life makes for a great Wikipedia entry, but Stephen Frears' movie makes her the butt of a single repetitive joke.|Rotten
Frears may not have a secure grasp on humor, but he's cast the picture smartly, securing emotionality when the film needs it the most.|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins is very much the story of a lie for the right reason that's never morally ambiguous or overtly cruel, which is a filmmaking feat more difficult to accomplish than getting Florence to sing well.|Fresh
It's an ode to living life sincerely, never mind the inevitable looming humiliation. After all, Jenkins may have been mercilessly mocked for decades, but she's never been forgotten.|Fresh
It's mildly amusing when it should be funny, sentimental when it should be deep and all too easy when it should be unsettling. It's still some kind of success, but a modest one.|Fresh
A cheerful ode to the values of loyalty and determination that hopes you'll overlook (or agree with?) the dubious 'everyone gets a trophy' philosophy that it tacitly endorses.|Fresh
"Despite lively performances, handsome costumes and a lavish sense of 1940s high society, ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" just doesn't hit all the right notes."|Rotten
Walks a fine line between deep mockery and genuine empathy.|Fresh
Streep's latest feats? Playing her first-ever dope, and making Hugh Grant relevant again.|Fresh
The fact that it is no surprise Meryl Streep delivers a virtuoso performance here shouldn't deny us the sheer joy of watching her do it.|Fresh
Stephen Frears' film achieves that remarkable and nearly unobtainable artistic plateau of sad-funny.|Fresh
Streep ... makes the character's delusional faith in her own talent so infectious that we ache at the thought of Florence's impending humiliation even as we prepare ourselves to laugh at it.|Fresh
Would do down real easy on a Sunday afternoon.|Fresh
This gentle and touching movie is a lot more fun than it may sound-thanks to Streep at her zany best and her surprisingly good, manly-man co-star, Hugh Grant.|Fresh
It's a pleasure seeing Grant in a great part again, playing the sort of almost-cad he's best at. And Streep - who, in real life, can belt anything from Broadway to Bruce - is clearly having a ball singing badly.|Fresh
A legitimately fascinating central character...Not surprisingly, Streep expertly shades every eccentricity, embodying Jenkins in her musical waywardness...|Fresh
Tragi-comic and sentimental - with superb performances - it's a poignant celebration of indulged eccentricity and pursuing your dreams.|Fresh
Stephen Frears masterfully recreates the happy world of a very unique character. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Meryl Streep is superb and her character is simply larger than life. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sumptuously decorated and rife with comically rich performances, director Stephen Frears draws out a funny, punchy portrait of self-delusion that actually parallels the social patterns that often accompany drug addiction.|Fresh
Streep is, as ever, flawless - to sing as bizarrely as this you have to know how to sing well in the first place -- and her chemistry with Grant is moreish in the extreme.|Fresh
The heart-over-head finale is pure cheese, but by that point Florence has engendered such goodwill that it almost dares you to mock the corniness.|Fresh
Grant is delightful here and Helberg just about steals it in a winningly camp turn, and yet this is naturally all about Meryl, who makes Florence so fabulously high-spirited you can't help but like her.|Fresh
Despite its imperfections, Florence Foster Jenkins is a heartfelt piece of cinema, and its emotional core leaves the screen with you.|Fresh
Screenwriter Nicholas Martin and director Stephen Frears have pulled off a neat trick with the true story of Florence Foster Jenkins: they've made it the story of her husband ... Florence is slightly absurd and sad ... but we ... see her through his eyes.|Fresh
Streep masterfully evokes the heiress's core dynamic - buffoonery mixed with a faint air of the tragic.|Fresh
Although this comedy-drama seems to have been written specifically to give Meryl Streep a chance to dress up and put on a silly show, it's actually all true.|Fresh
It's all broad humour and big-heartedness, out to entertain and amuse.|Fresh
It may have a slight televisual air about it but the warbling dame is larger-than-life and weirdly inspirational.|Fresh
Unlike Florence, director Stephen Frears manages to hit most of the right notes and in the right order.|Fresh
"More rigorous critics may sneer - I say ""Bravo!"""|Fresh
Florence Foster Jenkins is determined to shape its story into a crowd-pleaser but suffers from overexcited, uncontrolled performances and clumsy on the nose scripting.|Rotten
When FFJ sticks to farce, it works wonderfully, like something P.G. Wodehouse might have loved. But the longer it goes on, the more maudlin it gets.|Fresh
It's embarrassing to laugh at poor, deluded Florence but of course we do laugh while admiring the panache, the sheer gusto with which Streep tackles the role.|Fresh
The movie is delightful melodrama, but it has an Wildean bite and is, of course, all about the importance of being earnest.|Fresh
Ms Streep is delightful in the role, giving Florence a kind of quiet grace that counteracts her silliness, and getting tremendous comedy out of the singing sequences, which are suitably excruciating.|Fresh
Amid inevitable and deserved praise for Streep, one must pay very real tribute to Grant, who seems to have found a humanity not evidenced from him in years.|Fresh
Jenkins' story has inspired several plays, notably the West End hit Glorious!, and now this affectionate film portrait that is kept afloat by Streep's captivatingly addled performance.|Fresh
Florence couldn't hit the right note with a blunderbuss, but Streep's performance is pitch perfect.|Fresh
It hits just the right note - which is more than Florence ever managed.|Fresh
The irony of Florence Foster Jenkins, the ghastly soprano, was that she was such a crowd-pleaser. Fittingly, so is the film.|Fresh
Frears' biopic is both sly and affecting.|Fresh
If it's a light, fun, unapologetically sentimental, comic cinematic treat you seek, Florence Foster Jenkins offers a celebration of grand delusion on an operatic scale.|Fresh
This is an unusually honest portrayal of love as a system whereby two people can maintain one another's delusions to the point where they almost cease to be delusions at all.|Fresh
It is ultimately unsatisfying, as a psychological profile and otherwise.|Rotten
It takes skill to keep us laughing in a film with only one gag, but Frears' deadpan is the ideal accompaniment. He also keeps the joke from turning cruel.|Fresh
The complementary turns by Hugh Grant and Meryl Streep are so delightful that few will worry about the creative hypocrisy.|Fresh
Xavier Giannoli's Marguerite is very good, but Stephen Frears' more broadly comic variation on the theme is even better.|Fresh
It's fun.|Fresh
Streep finds an endearing empathy in the character that would have eluded most other performers, and her wonderful interplay with Hugh Grant once again bears out the rare calibre of her acting.|Fresh
Sadly, Stephen Frears gets the balance wrong with his latest film, with the result that neither the gags nor the heartfelt moments come off as intended.|Rotten
Delightfully, in the hands of director Stephen Frears it is a confident balance of uproarious laughs and genuine pathos, a lively, colourful, tender (and beautifully dressed) celebration of crazy dreamers and love.|Fresh
This feels like a very sad story that's been reconfigured to feel buoyant and charming. We're invited to point and laugh at Jenkins.|Rotten
Emblematic of a Florence Foster Jenkins performance, there is a much laughter to be had during this endeavour, and yet the production remains spiked by a profound sense of sadness, which runs deep throughout this tale.|Fresh
Meryl Streep continues her run of screw-the-Oscars movies with this ridiculously watchable comedy.|Fresh
As hard as it is to believe, both leading actors are overshadowed by comedian Simon Helberg who steals every scene as Jenkins' well-paid pianist.|Fresh
Stephen Frears works the material and his terrific cast to perfection, eliciting empathy and sympathy for a woman who desperately loved music but to whom fate had denied a beautiful voice|Fresh
Comedy and tragedy are beautifully intertwined in this entertaining, intriguing and heartbreaking tale when our hearts sink and soar in equal proportions|Fresh
This compelling biopic is a hugely entertaining, compassionate and ultimately rather touching portrait of self-delusion and devotion.|Fresh
A fizzy, funny, period dramedy with top-notch performances, Florence Foster Jenkins doesn't take many risks but it's a very entertaining experience.|Fresh
A delicious, finger-tingling comedy about the creative instinct that makes your heart want to squawk with joy.|Fresh
Aiming for the same kind of affectionate comic tone as The King's Speech, this gentle musical farce from director Stephen Frears hits more than a few flat notes, but still delivers gentle laughs and classy star performances.|Fresh
Bouquets all round: Stephen Frears goes broad in Florence Foster Jenkins, and the appeal should be wide.|Fresh
There are no wrong notes in this film: Frears remains entirely confident within the emotional range he has chosen.|Fresh
An audience picture first and foremost: one wholly sympathetic to its eponymous subject's delusional drive to delight crowds with or without the requisite artistry.|Fresh
There's a deceptively masterful simplicity to Frears' direction. In this age of blockbusters and superhero face-off mayhem, it reminds us that unfussiness is a virtue.|Fresh
