Hale County This Morning, This Evening is a marvelously lyrical look at an African-American community in Alabama. RaMell Ross establishes himself as a poetic voice and vision in non-fiction filmmaking.|Fresh
...subtly affecting and boldly ambitious.|Fresh
A collection of jagged, fleeting moments and atmospheric longueurs adding up to something far greater than the sum of its parts.|Fresh
There is something visionary in this film.|Fresh
Hale County is a kind of mini-epochal calendar art, turning its seasonal pages. With a heavier hand it would have become tendentious or messagey.|Fresh
Through framing and editing, small moments are imbued with a sense of spiritual grace, and the entirely mundane is recalibrated as the sublime.|Fresh
By posing... difficult questions, and by giving as much focus to the essential peripheries of life as its big events, Hale County has a powerful impact resonating far beyond the lives it depicts.|Fresh
[Director RaMell Ross'] aesthetic is strictly observational, like watching animals in their native habitat, the American zoo. Through class difference and intellectual distance, Ross treats the down-home folk like creatures.|Rotten
A pointillist portrait of black life in Alabama in which a series of bright little moments together form a broad and gorgeous tableau.|Fresh
If Hale County chooses to immerse itself in environments occupied by groups of people rather than excavate individual subjects and their personal lives, it remains a compassionate film nonetheless.|Fresh
Hale County has determination in spite of sensory trauma. It never rests, nor should it.|Fresh
It's Faulknerian prose made manifest through images.|Fresh
...the cinematic equivalent of a memory quilt, woven together with a deep love of community, comprised of intimate though disparate moments from others' lives, and poetically comforting despite its historically weighty components.|Fresh
By looking at what would lie outside of the traditional framework of most documentaries, Ross builds a much more absorbing picture of people fully embedded within an environment.|Fresh
The finished work is more akin to home movie than politically driven expos√©, its desire to give its subjects a voice over platform enough to force viewers to relate.|Fresh
Beauty does not skip over Hale County, [Ross] seems to say. It flows right through it, tasting of the remarkable and the yet-to-come.|Fresh
The ambitious documentary captures some small but significant moments in the black experience.|Fresh
A very particular sort of camera is at work in Hale County This Morning, This Evening.|Fresh
A stunning example of cinematic metaphysics, it is a remarkable debut for director RaMell Ross.|Fresh
Hale County features one of the most robust presentations of human experience ever committed to the screen.|Fresh
Ross' eye as a photographer results in amazing cinematography. The unorthodox documentary represents cinema in its purest form.|Fresh
Although there are families the film regularly checks in on, the impressionistic, often visually stunning Hale is more about the county's textures and atmospheres.|Fresh
Ross's images are intimate and emotive; the camera often follows people closely or shows details as if through his subjects' eyes, and a heightened color intensifies the mood.|Fresh
Hale County This Morning, This Evening is not sequential, but impressionistic and synergistic, based more on visual and auditory impressions than linear narrative accounts.|Fresh
Though made modestly and intimately, the film embodies a vast conceptual and aesthetic ambition.|Fresh
Ross has given us something valuable: a portrait of a small, overlooked section of America, presented without judgment.|Fresh
Hale County is the type of film designed to violate common rules of cinema. Story gives way to lyricism; there's little dialogue, minimal plot, minutes upon minutes of pastoral imagery...Ross's lens captures a reality that's rarely seen by the human eye.|Fresh
As a record of African-American imagery, it's not just an evaluation of 'how we are seen,' it's also a corrective that replaces stereotype with visual poetry.|Fresh
Ross remains ever attuned to the casual grace of quotidian human actions, and the subdued splendor of nature at its plainest. Hale County is documentation as a kind of auscultation; the camera functions as a stethoscope, capturing heartbeat and breath.|Fresh
Ross's camera captures the banal, the tragic and the triumphant alike, never lingering on any one moment for too long, and using a dreamy editing technique that doesn't always spell out its associations for us.|Fresh
Begins as an effective tone poem, but Ross muddles the documentary with attempts at characterization and narrative.|Rotten
In Ross's hands, intimate, human, physically-grounded episodes routinely become passageways opening onto the operations of nature.|Fresh
Mr. Ross retains a patient and focused eye. His camera's gaze has a quality of reserve, one that insistently imparts respect to his subjects.|Fresh
If Ross had embraced anything like a narrative line, would it have taken away from the elemental imagery of his brief, unconventional film?|Fresh
[Ross] creates a sparsely beautiful film; his shots of insects at night, or cars waiting for an animal to clear the road, are hypnotic|Fresh
Ross never makes anything explicit. Instead, he invites the viewer to make connections, sense the bigger picture from the shattered shards that he makes visible.|Fresh
The doc is more invested in mourners after a burial than in immediate reactions or big events. This is a story made of the in-between pieces of stories.|Fresh
One of the remarkable things about the film's offhand sense of intimacy is that it emerges from such a diverse shooting style.|Fresh
Hale Country works best in its quietest moments, when Ross allows his audience just to sit and engage with the subjects. When he zooms in, forcing us to take in one particular frame instead of everything around us, the poetry of the film is elevated.|Fresh
Ross has a preternatural talent for capturing moments, souls and unorthodox time-lapses. Every shot seems to maximize the cinematographic potential of the scene through dexterous camerawork, while excellent sound collaging matches the scattered visuals.|Fresh
"The routines most of us would write off as trivialities are, through Ross' eyes, made recognizable as individual pieces of a greater whole. ""Hale County This Morning, This Evening"" is humbly existential."|Fresh
It's not every day that you witness a new cinematic language being born, but watching RaMell Ross's evocatively titled documentary Hale County, This Morning, This Evening qualifies.|Fresh
