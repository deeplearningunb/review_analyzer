Hawkins grabs and holds the scenes, not with overdramatics, but with humour and delectable gestures.|Fresh
Maudie is a riveting and brilliantly acted insight into what is to most of us the life of a little known to us folk artist, though beloved in Canada, who against all the odds triumphed over her surroundings.|Fresh
Who would have known that behind the gentle, smiling face and diminutive frame lay years of pain and struggle? And yet, in spite of it all, she dipped her brushes in colourful paints and gave us nostalgic visions of bright-eyed innocence.|Fresh
Maudie ultimately just seems like a quaint exercise, more like visiting a history museum than watching a woman who truly lived.|Rotten
The two lead actors, and the careful direction by Aisling Walsh are what make this film work.|Fresh
An intimate portrait of a complex life, the film delivers rewards for its unusual circumstances, much like Maud Lewis herself.|Fresh
Hawke has more of a mountain to climb when it comes to being convincing as an ordinary Nova Scotia bod, but even he comes good by the end.|Fresh
As Maud, Sally Hawkins gives an outstanding physical performance matched by a quiet resolve and a somewhat mischievous sense of humour.|Fresh
Hawkins is outstanding in depicting the physical impairments that the artist struggled with, as well as the fiercely loving spirit that kept her going through incredible hardships.|Fresh

Both Hawkins and Hawke are very good in Maudie, and if you're looking to qualify it you'd arrive first at the fact that they both effect physical transformations of a sort.|Fresh
... it's a sweet film (despite the couple's unrelenting poverty and Maud's often difficult day-to-day life), and both actors manage to overcome somewhat mannered performances to be quite affecting.|Fresh
In this film Maud is resilient, but Hawkins conveys this in subtle ways as Maud's creativity flourishes and her confidence grows.|Fresh
"As a physically handicapped folk artist, Sally Hawkins's performance is even better than it was as a cleaner in ""The Shape of Water."""|Fresh
This enchanting film centers on the outsider artist's unusual, at times abusive, but ultimately loving relationship with her employer-turned-husband Everett.|Fresh
It tells the poignant true story of Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis, whose famously na√Øve, but charming paintings garnered the humble native of Nova Scotia world-wide celebrity.|Fresh
The tone is mawkish, the pace slow and both Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke overact horribly.|Rotten
In all of Maud's unfailingly cheerful oeuvre, Walsh found she never painted a self-portrait. Maudie is the result of the director's desire to fill that gap.|Fresh
Hawkins is one of the greats and, along with Hawke at his gruffest, makes Maudie a best-case biopic.|Fresh
Hawkins, once again, creates an impenetrable aura of resolute happiness.|Fresh
Aisling Walsh's biographical adaptation of a true life story will surely tug at your heartstrings.|Fresh
. . .Maudie director Aisling Walsh and screenwriter Sherry White stand back to observe two down-and-out survivors from a relatively dispassionate perspective, not indifferent but more interested in watching. . .|Fresh
Both writer and director set out in search of a heroine. They're so intent on crafting a legend, they leave out the uncomfortable bits. They do her and us a disservice in that respect.|Fresh
Maudie delivers as an occasionally touching portrait of the woman because of an incredible leading performance by Sally Hawkins who dissolves into the title role seamlessly.|Fresh
Director Aisling Walsh handles Sherry White's script with depth and sensitivity.|Fresh
In a performance that echoes her breakthrough role in Mike Leigh's Happy-Go-Lucky, Hawkins embraces this fiercely independent spirit, broken body and softly-spoken soul.|Fresh
A lead performance alive with exquisite spirit and inspiration elevates Maudie, a selective biopic of famous Canadian 'outsider' artist Maud Lewis, well above what could have been a very sketchy outcome.|Fresh
Although the material is slight, the humanity and its universality make it cinematic, if not entirely satisfying.|Fresh
While neither of the central characters is especially likeable, it is the dynamic of the unusual relationship between them that sparks our interest.|Fresh
The story, the characters, and the place, there is beauty in each one, but they fail to conjoin.|Rotten
With its plaintive score and bleak landscapes, it seems to unfold as slowly as a Nova Scotia winter, but it has one thunderously exciting asset in the performance of Sally Hawkins.|Fresh
What an immersive and strangely transporting picture this is.|Fresh
Shines as a substantial illustration that love can take root even in the context of failure, frailty, and poverty --in fact, those things just might be what make it possible.|Fresh
The scenery of Nova Scotia is beautifully [filmed] by cinematographer Guy Timmins.|Fresh
Alongside a gruffer-than-gruff Ethan Hawke as Everett, Sally Hawkins hunches and hobbles as the arthritic Maud, but this never seems too much of a stunt: what stands out is her way with Lewis's gentle stubbornness.|Fresh
Dubliner Aisling Walsh's biopic of Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis is a handsome, sensitive drama, laced with tragedy and discord. Hawkins and Hawke duet well in what are physically demanding lead roles.|Fresh
Maudie is a sad film about poor people, but it could scarcely be more open to benevolence and quiet humanism.|Fresh
Walsh's film feels jarringly at odds with contemporary sensibilities. A bully is a bully, no matter how cheerfully he is painted.|Rotten
Sally Hawkins is wonderful as the fragile but irrepressible Maudie, and Ethan Hawke is, if anything, even better as a man terrified of caring.|Fresh
Sally Hawkins gives the performance of her life in this touching portrait of Canadian artist Maud Lewis.|Fresh
[Maudie] feels frustratingly incomplete where it really counts.|Rotten
Hawkins is simply terrific, immersing herself completely in the character and imbuing her with an infectious sense of warmth and optimism.|Fresh
The true-life origins are underplayed, which allows the emotions to speak for themselves and it's hard to fault either of the leads, though it's fair to say we're always aware how hard they're working to realise these unusual, ultimately worthwhile roles.|Fresh
A difficult and highly mannered performance from Sally Hawkins coupled with a repugnant and profoundly unappealing character played by Ethan Hawke sink this curious, and curiously saccharine, biopic.|Rotten
There's not much in the way of plot, but the film's simple beauty, gorgeous scenery, and marvelous acting by Hawkins and Hawke make this one to see.|Fresh
The subtlety of Hawke and Hawkins makes this otherwise broad brushstroke film worth watching.|Fresh
Walsh smartly keeps the style as simple as Maudie's childlike paintings, leaving Hawkins and Ethan Hawke room to explore the intricacies of their unlikely union.|Fresh
[Maudie] fulfils all our narrative expectations and you'll almost certainly exit the cinema happy, so long as you can leave it there.|Fresh
The only fireworks here are of the indoor kind, but this sensitive, beautifully acted film lingers long after the final frame. And the Newfoundland locations are breathtaking.|Fresh
Maud Lewis left the world a brighter place than she found it. This drably earnest rendering of her life story doesn't follow suit.|Rotten
A big performance at the centre of rather a modest film.|Fresh
Aisling Walsh knows how to balance the comedy and the pathos as she takes us through her subject's life and chronicles her unlikely emergence as an artist.|Fresh
Hawkins shines in a touching biopic that will make you laugh, cry and Google its subject afterwards.|Fresh
Although it can't be denied that the film has moments of tenderness, the director and her talented cast are not interested in selling a fairy tale to the viewer. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hawkins is the best reason to see this sluggish, pinched, claustrophobic little biopic; whenever it threatens to grow dreary, which it does often, the spunky light in her eyes draws us back.|Fresh
While rough around the edges, Hawkins earns sympathy in a film that never panders or trivializes her character's afflictions.|Fresh
The main reason to see the biopic Maudie is for the honest and complete performance by Sally Hawkins.|Fresh
The sluggish pacing and banal filmmaking means each scene just sits there on the screen, failing to tie into any larger theme or illuminate deeper truths.|Rotten
An inspiring portrait of the resilience of a crippled but immensely creative woman.|Fresh
As impressive as Hawkins is, the usually delicate, restlessly intelligent Hawke equals her performance.|Fresh
Mundane moments are far more prevalent in real life than the melodramatic ones. Which is one of the things I most appreciate about Maudie, Irish filmmaker Aisling Walsh's look at the life of folk artist Maud Lewis.|Fresh
Maudie tells the quiet, inspiring story of Maud Lewis, a humble Canadian folk artist whose determined spirit overcame her modest and debilitating circumstances.|Fresh
"The biographical drama ""Maudie"" is a delicate and beautiful little film, which is utterly appropriate for the frail person whose life -- trying to add beauty to a harsh world -- it aims to depict."|Fresh
Maudie works as an unconventional love story that reminds the audience about the importance of looking beyond appearances. It's also a testament to the transformative power of art.|Fresh
The movie stumbles within the framework of the great-artist biopic, but it can be affecting as a depiction of a troubled, complex and sometimes tender romance.|Fresh
"""Maudie"" shouldn't sugarcoat those hardships by presenting Everett as anything better than he was. In a way, the film acts much as her brush did, bringing color to parts of Maudie's life where it may not have actually existed."|Rotten
Hawkins goes beyond the physical portrayal. It's moving enough watching an artist paint through pained and painful movements. But her performance is also a life-affirming depiction of a woman who saw the world differently.|Fresh
Hawke does his best to convey both Everett's brute nature and love for Maud that grows as they age. But it's Hawkins who really shines in this unaffected film, full of poetic Canadian seaside vistas.|Fresh
There's much to appreciate in Maudie, especially if you're a fan of odd-pair love stories, but don't expect to learn much about what drives folk artists to create or what makes a woman pelted by life's lemons squeeze them into lemonade.|Rotten
It's a nice, unassuming movie, such as one might take one's aged mother to, with a warmth that compensates for its lack of insight.|Fresh
A myopic film opened up, bright and wide, by two great performances|Fresh
A touching character study... a charming portrait of a woman who found a life of simple contentment with a most unlikely partner.|Fresh
Don't let the lazy, pedestrian storytelling drive you away from experiencing the year's best -- so far -- performance by an actress. Hawkins is simply sensational.|Fresh
Walsh shapes Hawkins and Hawke's interplay so that the film registers as a bizarre-couple love story... These actors conjure a deep nonverbal bond that defies explanation.|Fresh
Maudie would be captivating even if the title character had never painted a lick.|Fresh
Into our suffocatingly aggrieved world comes Maudie, so striking for its portrait of a woman who has every reason to surrender to pessimism but does not.|Fresh
"Sally Hawkins is a delight in ""Maudie,"" but then, when isn't she?"|Fresh
The story offers many opportunities for glibness and sentimentality. Walsh falls for none of them.|Fresh
Maudie is directed by Irish filmmaker Aisling Walsh, who allows the complex relationship between Maud and Everett to unfold at a proper pace.|Fresh
While Maud's story is powerful, it's the dysfunctional relationship at the center of Maudie - and the it's romanticized - that prevents the film from being truly enjoyable.|Rotten
While Maudie is a film to be admired, and certainly Hawkins' performance is beautiful and heartbreaking, a richer portrait of Maud Lewis is still waiting to be painted.|Fresh
Maudie is a slow, earnest film that pleasantly subverts the narrow-minded hagiography we expect from the story of an artist.|Fresh
The thing that saves Maudie from becoming a miserable viewing experience is Sally Hawkins. She's just a joy to watch.|Fresh
Walsh's uncluttered storytelling allows the actors to go to raw and stirring places, and the film becomes an affecting portrait of meaningful companionship amid hardship.|Fresh
"In ""Maudie,"" the infinitely gifted Sally Hawkins gives an incandescent performance as the woman whose indomitable spirit shines through her art."|Fresh
All this good work is a heavy load for Maud the movie character. Hawkins carries it with a graceful energy, helped by Maudie's visual approach, sometimes delicately impressionistic and sometimes more artisanal.|Fresh
This Irish-Canadian drama tells the true story of Maud Lewis (played beautifully by Sally Hawkins).|Fresh
Hawkins disappears into the performance, capturing Maud's physical limitations but also the light in her eyes, the sly humor in her observations about life -- and her gift for seeing the greatest beauty in the simplest things.|Fresh
"[Hawkins is] such a vivid presence, so alert to what can be mined from the space in between her lines, she lifts ""Maudie"" above the pedestrian."|Fresh
"Hawke is good at playing bad, but Hawkins is better, rendering, in ""Maudie,"" a portrait of a woman that feels raw, real and revelatory."|Fresh
Hawkins ... delivers a performance of dogged detail; she's a woman who seems to absorb every insult and disappointment in the stoop of her stance, the pain etched across her face.|Fresh
Ethan Hawke and Sally Hawkins draw an honest portrait, stripped of sentimentality, of a wonderfully imperfect couple. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Maudie] details the real-life perseverance of Nova Scotia-based folk artist Maud Lewis (1903-1970) who, despite crippling rheumatoid arthritis, flourished as a primitive painter...Hawkins's and Hawke's performances are the year's best so far.|Fresh
"One way to get through the long, agonizing experience of ""Maudie"" is to convince yourself it's a comedy. The spectacle of the actors flailing in a vacuum makes this possible, but intermittently, so the relief comes only in bursts."|Rotten
Hawkins doesn't rise above the film's conception, but she makes it work.|Fresh
Hawkins turns in a heartfelt performance as real-life painter Maud Lewis (1903-1970), carrying a biographical drama that's lovely and gentle without ever becoming soft or sentimental.|Fresh
The film can be sad, even brutal at times, yet also a touching testament to love's endurance and the joy one can find in one's own backyard.|Fresh
Aisling Walsh's shimmering drama hands Sally Hawkins an Oscar-worthy role in an emotional and inspirational biopic about art, love and this cruel beautiful world of ours.|Fresh
Ultimately, though, Maudie mostly succeeds by skirting twee sentimentality.|Fresh
Sally Hawkins gives a standout performance in Maudie.|Fresh
...a heart-rending film to sit through but well worth it. Both Hawkins and Hawke give eye-popping performances but Hawkins, particularly, should be up for an Oscar(R)...one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
There's something real and touching here. In Everett's thwarted struggles with his own, clumsy emotions. In Maudie's determination to find beauty in absolutely everything.|Fresh
As unassuming and gentle as its subject,  Maudie breaks your heart with its infectious positivity and an outstanding Sally Hawkins, who can always be relied on for an emotionally sturdy, big-hearted performance.|Fresh
Maudie's biggest success is Walsh's interest in depicting the environment from which art springs, rather than laying out some simple emotional cause for its generation.|Fresh
Sally Hawkins is marvelous as real-life folk artist Maud Lewis in this gentle, moving biopic.|Fresh
Maudie scores high for good intentions and solid work by its stars. Its story is one-of-a-kind but I wish I hadn't felt so conscious of the wheels turning as it unfolded.|Fresh
Hawkins's performance... transcends surface mimicry to conjure up a deeply moving portrait of a humble woman who lived for her paintings and quite possibly even changed some lives in the process.|Fresh
"""Maudie"" is one of those movies that triumph over their worst instincts (and your well-honed doubts)."|Fresh
Plays like a pop-up version of a thoroughly written Wikipedia entry, albeit a charming one. Most of that charm resides in the effortless grace with which Hawkins - giving one of the best performances of the year - takes to the character ...|Fresh
A portrait of the artist as a hermit wife that overcomes some clunky early brushstrokes to achieve a genuine grace and considerable poignancy.|Fresh
[An] exquisitely crafted film.|Fresh
The story has the hollow ring of artifice, even though Ms. Hawkins shrinks quite remarkably into the physical aspects of the role and opens up its spiritual dimensions.|Rotten
This film shows instead of tells, and what it shows is sad, disturbing, beautiful, and moving, sometimes all at once.|Fresh
Simplistic and sincere - with an exquisite performance by Sally Hawkins - it's an improbable success story.|Fresh
Maudie is hit-or-miss, but you'll probably bawl anyway.|Fresh
This is very much a film that rests on two stunning performances. It's going to take some special competition between now and December to keep Hawkins off next year's Oscars shortlist, and don't be surprised if Hawke is also in the mix.|Fresh
Strong performances anchor this love story between an artistic beauty and her beast.|Fresh
Once the years and decades start ticking by unacknowledged, the well-developed and subtle characterizations established by Hawkins and Hawke disappear into a cloud of aging makeup and incident ...|Rotten
Maud Lewis herself couldn't paint a hurricane that would blow the film's overburdened narrative off course.|Rotten
The first two Oscar-worthy performances of 2017 belong to Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke.|Fresh
It will take five astounding performances to keep Hawkins off Oscar's short list.|Fresh
In deft camera strokes -- and lit up by Sally Hawkins' remarkable performance -- it paints a keen picture of one woman getting by, and two people staying married in a backwater nook where comforts are few and far between.|Fresh
I Hawkins . . . twists herself into a wry, mousy character who shuffles through a world of unforgiving 1930s morality, when a woman with physical afflictions could be viewed as a mental incompetent.|Fresh
The heart and mind of Maudie are always in the right place.|Fresh
The simplicity of mixing creative crafts with everyday chores recalls the village life that dominated the planet for thousands of years, and the straightforward Maudie, an Irish-Canadian coproduction, pretty much sticks to that approach.|Fresh
This is a painter whose canvas was her life, and whose life her canvas. Maudie is a magnificent celebration of both.|Fresh
It's beautifully shot, even if the painting often feels incidental.|Fresh
Expressive acting by Hawkins and Hawke smooths out narrative bumps, creating a portrait of a woman in thrall to art and nature and a couple whose love resisted hardship and defied definition.|Fresh
Hawkins, capturing the real-life Maud's mischievous spark, invests herself wholly in the role, and Hawke's choices never feel easy or manipulative. Bring kleenex.|Fresh
The sort of title you'd be thrilled to stumble across on the telly on a Sunday evening, but not one you'd necessarily need to indulge in on the big screen.|Fresh
Sally Hawkins delivers an unforgettable performance as Nova Scotian folk artist Maude Lewis in this gently flowing biopic set in the 1930s.|Fresh
Features a strong performance by Sally Hawkins, but not much else.|Rotten
It's a predictable romance that nearly overshadows the detailed, fascinating character drama within.|Fresh
"A romantic drama with a scruffy integrity, ""Maudie"" is, for better and for worse, an actorly exercise in presenting an audience with two willfully peculiar characters and then trying to find a way to make us fall in love with them."|Fresh
