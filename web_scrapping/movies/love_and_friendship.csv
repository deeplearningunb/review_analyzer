Love and Friendship has to be one of the best adaptations of [Jane Austen's] work yet, and is perhaps Stillman's best film up to to his point as well.|Fresh

It's a handsome production, like most period pieces set in Great Britain, but that's not enough to make Love & Friendship more than a marginal work.|Rotten
The average age of an Austen heroine is 19. Enter Lady Susan, a widowed mother of 40 or so. She is refined, attractive, and boasts a far superior intellect than the friends and family she surrounds herself with.|Fresh
[Whit] Stillman has finally achieved what he now seems to have always been working towards: the merging of his contemporary bourgeois comedies of errors with the literary precedents that inspired them.|Fresh
Love and Friendship is very funny, funnier still for its absence of moral reckoning.|Fresh
Filmmaker [Whit Stillman] has learned some of the [Jane Austen's] wit and subtlety, while tossing out the vapid whining that so often mars his modern films.|Fresh
... it's an absolute delight.|Fresh
Writer/director Whit Stillman has a firm grip on satirizing a society's manners and protocols.|Fresh
In his adaptation of Austen's novella Lady Susan, director Whit Stillman manages to bring to the screen a tedious and drawn-out movie that tries too hard and goes nowhere at a snail's pace; disappointing is an understatement.|Rotten
Though the corseted bodices and full skirts suggest an Oscar bait-y period drama, Stillman quickly establishes Love & Friendship as an out-and-out comedy.|Fresh
The dialogue and satire are worthy of Monty Python.|Fresh
In the masterful hands of the director and boosted by a deliciously manipulative performance by Kate Beckinsale, this feels like the most refreshing take on Austen's work ever put on screen.|Fresh
A lesser-known novel by Jane Austen becomes an auspicious foray into costume drama by Whit Stillman. Kate Beckinsale shines.|Fresh
Love & Friendship is one of Mr. Metropolitan's best.|Fresh
An agile and funny story, with a simple but effective atmosphere. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film where the American director has done an excellent job in translating the novel into dialogues and their interpreters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Halfway through Love & Friendship... I felt a stab of terrible rage. How had this wonderful book not been adapted before, and why has the hilarious Kate Beckinsale been kept from (intelligent) audiences for so long?|Fresh
I've seen Austen adaptations that are more romantic, but few that are so hilarious.|Fresh
If only all adaptations of Jane Austen were as vibrant and authentic as Love & Friendship.|Fresh
Pure confection with a nasty little soul, and it's utterly pleasurable in the way that only pure decadence can be.|Fresh
The best performance comes from relative unknown Tom Bennett, who makes a fine addition to the all-time great cinematic lunkheads as Sir James Martin, the suitor of Lady Susan's daughter.|Fresh
A film that gains interest because of Tom Bennett's presence, the perfect character for a story full of gossip, appearances and hidden interests. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Susan provides the cutting wit, Sir James the broad comedy and giggling silliness, and filmmaker Stillman the social frame and elegant world to make it all work.|Fresh
A film where the gestures, the words and what they hide in a subtle way are perfectly interchangeable with the media world of our time. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A clever film with a great cast that includes revelations like Xavier Samuel and Tom Bennett. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Stillman keeps it all afloat in a froth of quick wit and beautiful costumes and cinematography.|Fresh
The trick for Beckinsale was to make it stylish and comedic enough to maintain audience sympathy for such an inscrutable demon, which is actually a bit of an acting tightrope to walk.|Fresh

This adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is a brilliant film about female manipulation. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
More of a piece with Stillman's other films than with such Austen adaptations as Sense and Sensibility and Emma.|Fresh
"Whit Stillman's Love & Friendship is a strangely misguided attempt at bringing Jane Austen's novella ""Lady Susan"" to the big screen."|Rotten
This is a delightful, entertaining comedy filled with wonderful dialogue.|Fresh
...has about it something of the feel of a screwball comedy. There's a bit of Preston Sturges in the film, and while the dialogue is set in period vocabulary, it's delivered in a way that feels quite modern.|Fresh
Love & Friendship is magnificent, and anyone saying otherwise is in my eyes one gouty attack away from objectionable ignominy.|Fresh
Whit Stillman said that his primary filmic influence for Love & Friendship was the Steve Martin and Michael Caine slice of genius Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Scoundrels would be proud to see the result of his love and friendship.|Fresh
Tone in Jane Austen is all-important, hinging on a delicate balance between the tender and the sardonic. Whit Stillman captures it perfectly in the trailer for Love & Friendship. In the film itself, the hinge creaks a bit.|Fresh
Kate Beckinsale takes much of the credit for the film's success.|Fresh
Austen did like to have fun with her characters to show the stranger sides we all have. Watching this classy adaptation of one of her lesser-known works will remind you of that, and make you laugh.|Fresh
With this keenly observed comedy of manners, director Whit Stillman has successfully reimagined the period romance for contemporary audiences. Sharp, funny and briskly paced.|Fresh
From one of Jane Austen's lesser-known works -- the posthumously published novella Lady Susan -- springs one of the finest Austen movie adaptations on record.|Fresh
Beckinsale is the perfect vessel for this dialogue, rattling off completely un-self aware statements and insults that border on the ridiculous with a straight face.|Fresh
The movie, filled with the beautiful costumes and country real-estate porn that are de rigueur for a story set in this period, is fast-paced and enjoyable from start to finish.|Fresh
This is about as far from a typical Jane Austen adaptation as you can imagine possible, and only serves to highlight the writer's sharp wit and ahead-of-her-times sensibilities.|Fresh
Mildly diverting.|Fresh
Whit Stillman doesn't go far enough, not for me anyway, with his stylised satire about a right bitch of a scheming, lying, selfish woman, Lady Susan Vernon - played to the death by a sparkling Kate Beckinsale|Fresh
Love, money and convenience engage in a merry dance, in this engaging comedy of manners adapted from Jane Austen's novella Lady Susan|Fresh
Wry and witty, Love & Friendship is one of the funniest films of the year, a costume comedy for the ages.|Fresh
Alas, there's nobody to root for in any of this: you feel manipulated by Lady Susan, sorry for Frederica, irritated by Reginald, and embarrassed by Sir James.|Rotten
t seems to me, if you like Whit Stillman's films, you probably love them. If you truly dislike his humor and preoccupation with the bourgeois lifestyle's preoccupation with codes of conduct, Love & Friendship might just not be your cup of tea.|Fresh
It's a jaunty, spiffy, upbeat and pacy movie, the kind where everyone is too busy being witty, flirtatious and tart to sit down ... a completely worthy addition to the Austen canon by someone who obviously cared very much to contribute.|Fresh
The requisite tossed-off zingers and genre subversion abound, with Tom Bennett nearly stealing the show as the charmingly rambling Sir James Martin.|Fresh
Stillman, Beckinsale, and Austen really share the honours here, though, in this witty, watchable, film.|Fresh
Turns out this strangely titled adaptation, named after another of Austen's novellas, isn't just delightful good fun, it's also terribly funny, sharp and dry, and wonderfully brought to life by an irrepressible Kate Beckinsale.|Fresh
The literary-cinematic marriage between Stillman and Austen is bracingly appropriate.|Fresh
Wickedly funny adaptation based on Austen novella.|Fresh
A more fortunate marriage than any suggested in its narrative, Stillman's first period piece makes a perfect match of Austen's timeless comedy and the director's lapidary mise-en-scene.|Fresh
Whit Stillman might have been Jane Austen in a past life, because the filmmaker's sense matches the author's sensibility in this frequently amusing adaptation.|Fresh
Stillman directs with the zing of a Howard Hawks comedy while his screenplay fluidly reshapes Austen's formal prose into sharp, accessible dialogue.|Fresh
"Love & Friendship is about little or nothing, yet it exposes to our rushed lives the joys of an era in which people actually talked to each other, not to machines. As a comedy of manners, it delightfully skewers its ""polite society."""|Fresh
Beneath the impertinent, literary banter is a sedate - almost cold - vision of cruelty, greed, and selfishness. It recalls Stillman's The Last Days of Disco (1998), but without the soulful warmth of disco music to buoy the characters' urbane desperation.|Fresh
"To call this adaptation of Jane Austen's early novella Lady Susan ""a breath of fresh air"" would not do justice to director Whit Stillman's vicious comedy of manners."|Fresh
An effervescent work, acute in its comedy, a tonal nudge in the ribs, with a slight, but perceptible vein of wry cynicism.|Fresh
An engaging spicy rom/com screen adaptation of Lady Susan, Jane Austen's epistolary novel published posthumously in 1871.|Fresh
Lady Susan may be a bad person, but with Austen at her sharpest, Stillman at his snappiest and Beckinsale right on form, she is very good company.|Fresh
Calling all Jane Austen fans: 'Love & Friendship' is a don't-miss.|Fresh
There's enough to enjoy in his adaptation, especially from a dialogue front and particularly from the performances by Bennett and especially Beckinsale who shines in her part. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, etc. - Also Available)|Fresh
Acclaimed filmmaker Whit Stillman reunites the stars of his 1998 drama The Last Days of Disco, Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny, for what might be the most entertaining big-screen Jane Austen adaptation ever.|Fresh
Even as he relishes sinuous-sentence lines, Stillman finds a comic sprightliness in his take on Austen. Crafty and exuberant, this film finely dresses up its radical-rebel of a conniving woman in a polished, poised show of eloquent entertainment.|Fresh
Lady Susan is infuriating in her ability to justify whatever she wants to do and you want all her romantic plans to fail, but Beckinsale nevertheless makes her into delightful company.|Fresh
The adventures of a world-class schemer and dreamer.|Fresh
It would be easy to make a movie that condemns Lady Susan, but it's much more fun to watch her succeed, especially when Stillman surrounds her with people far from her intellectual equal.|Fresh
It is often laugh-out-loud funny, it's beautiful to watch (it was shot around Dublin) and has far broader appeal than standard period drama.|Fresh
Love And Friendship proves to be one of the finest ever Austen adaptations.|Fresh
Snappy, snarky comedy of manners, appealing primarily to women and indefatigable Austen fans.|Fresh
I've never been much of a Jane-ite, myself. Converted now, though.|Fresh
What a treat. Well played, Mr Stillman!|Fresh
This is a sterling comic role for [Beckinsale], and her timing is split-second perfection.|Fresh
This is the zingiest Austen adaptation you'll ever see, with the usual pastel palette and slow decorum abandoned in favour of acid colours and acid remarks, which keep the audience in stitches.|Fresh
Love & Friendship is highly entertaining, with Austen's text fitting Stillman's style like a Regency-era glove.|Fresh
Stillman's film unfolds delightfully, is full of fun and wit, and Tom Bennett is superb as the idiotic but inordinately wealthy suitor.|Fresh
Whit Stillman skillfully weaves the threads of a story that is more witty than audiences might expect.|Fresh
Beckinsale is excellent as the pragmatically lusty Lady Susan, wrapping every blockhead man around her finger and coiling her tongue through the deadpan barbs of Stillman's script.|Fresh
Any doubts that Jane Austen's novels and Hollywood's screwball comedies are close cousins is erased by Love & Friendship, a dryly delightful experience.|Fresh
Why, Mr Stillman, we are driven to conclude that, in your match with Miss Austen, you have engineered a union more perfect than any found in divine nature.|Fresh
The movie is a perfect showcase for Beckinsale, who tears through Austen's verbiage as thoroughly as her character devours any male in her presence.|Fresh
It's a comic triumph with script, cast and performances combining to provide a perfect storm of mannered nastiness and an Austen adaptation that makes Pride + Prejudice + Zombies look positively lifeless.|Fresh
Love & Friendship is an unexpected delight, a very dry and tremendously witty adaptation of a little known Jane Austen novella.|Fresh
The jaunty irreverence of Whit Stillman's adaptation could almost pass as parody but it is delightfully entertaining.|Fresh
Love & Friendship is Jane Austen's world at its most devilishly delightful, with Kate Beckinsale giving the performance of her career as a woman who is a schemer, a fortune-hunter, a silver-tongued devil.|Fresh
Even though this is a walking and talking film, except in those instances when it's a sitting and talking film, Stillman keeps everything moving fast, fast, fast while the script crackles and spits and bites.|Fresh
Stillman is a good-humored jester all through the film. He's front and center giggling to himself like a barkeeper in the Kingdom of Heaven.|Fresh
A delightful comic romp that fans of the classic English author will love.|Fresh
It's self-consciously mannered and merrily playful; a mixture that Austen herself might find just right.|Fresh
Love & Friendship is a refreshing and invigorating delight.|Fresh
What wicked good fun it is watching this bad girl do her worst.|Fresh
The love part of Love & Friendship is played for laughs; love in this era among such people is a business arrangement, not a romantic match.|Fresh
Most of this film is a joy. It's Plain Jane compared to some, but its deadpan wit and poker-faced comic naturalism come to seem the ideal to which all Austen cinema should aspire.|Fresh
The funniest, most deliciously venomous Jane Austen movie ever made, and conclusive proof that, a) Kate Beckinsale has been seriously undervalued by the movies and, b) Whit Stillman is a major, distinctive talent.|Fresh
A cheerfully cynical romantic comedy in which the romantic lead is also the villain -- and still somehow finds her way to a happy ending.|Fresh
It is Austen -- reasonably at least -- with a touch of Oscar Wilde and full-on Whit Stillman. Funny, appealing, civilized -- and fully aware of the artifice holding it all together.|Fresh
Love & Friendship is Stillman's first foray into period drama, and it shows -- in a good way.|Fresh
Deftly staged, briskly paced and very funny, thanks largely to Beckinsale's crack timing and Tom Bennett's breakout performance.|Fresh
L&F's burnished cinematography and elegant performances offer a droll soulfulness that embodies everything we still love, and like, about Jane Austen.|Fresh
"A classic, conniving and cunning Kate Beckinsale steals most of the thunder from the rest of Whit Stillman's droll cast in this funny and mostly accessible ""Downton Abbey""-like lark."|Fresh
Love & Friendship is hilarious, maybe the funniest movie of the year, and that it's classic Austen, featuring a sarcastic heroine who thinks she knows what's best for everyone and who probably is right.|Fresh
It's refreshing to find a Jane Austen adaptation that's as witty and subversive as Whit Stillman's Love & Friendship.|Fresh
Boasting a beautifully calibrated tone, it's wickedly droll and choicely acted by the entire ensemble.|Fresh
Superb Enjoyment|Fresh
Its multitude of pleasures rest in dialogue rich in wit and mellifluous in structure.|Fresh
Love & Friendship has the air of one of those movies where you sense the actors had the time of their lives on the set, what with getting to wear the garb of the time and reciting such sublime dialogue and performing such exquisitely choreographed scenes.|Fresh
Splendid from start to finish. Miss Beckinsale emits a clear sense that her character is not only fully in control of Plan A, but concurrently beetling away at Plan B and, we suspect, subsequent plans up to and including Zed.|Fresh
Best ever Kate Beckinsale, could have been naughtier|Fresh
It's a movie that is not just an achievement in its own right, but the sort that makes one reconsider all of Stillman's previous films.|Fresh
Winningly, and wittily, brought to the screen by writer-director Whit Stillman and a superbly chosen cast...rarely has the fit between author and adapter felt so marvelously right.|Fresh
If Love & Friendship seems more cutting than Austen's usual fare, thank director Whit Stillman.|Fresh
"""Love & Friendship"" is a film to make an action fan tear his or her hair out; it's all walking and talking. But what talking!"|Fresh
Intelligent, nuanced, literate, and dismally dry; there's little of the juice that Stillman brought to his earlier films as a chronicler of his own times.|Rotten
As adaptations go, this is a match made in heaven.|Fresh
Love & Friendship is a comedy of manners, and manors, and more. It's a comedy of empowerment and sexual politics, dressed up in the best Austen finery.|Fresh
It's the cinematic version of inventing a chocolate bar that makes you lose weight - something really tasty that's actually good for you.|Fresh
It's securely in its proper time and place, but this is an unusual side of Austen, cooler and more nakedly cunning. It feels very modern indeed.|Fresh
What a lovely meeting, a novelist who was ahead of her time and a filmmaker determinedly, irretrievably outside his own. It's like two very different people meeting on a blind date, and suddenly sparks are flying.|Fresh
An intelligent actress too often wasted in butt-numbing action movies, Beckinsale is endlessly captivating as a formidable woman low on funds but high on manipulative genius.|Fresh
An onrushing delight, captured in bright and creamy light... a vessel for Kate Beckinsale's liquid lashings of the tongue, but Lady Susan is of no time, and of this time, and the most modern of characters, as in [Stillman's] earlier near-period pieces.|Fresh
Like Austen, Stillman delights in the considerable distance between what people believe and how they behave.|Fresh
"For the most part ... ""Love & Friendship"" is a frolic: crisp and closeted rather than expansive, with curt exchanges in drawing rooms, carriages, and gardens."|Fresh
The costumes are gorgeous, fitted constructions in bold colors and beautiful patterns, the formidable uniform of a fierce, independent woman taking control of her own destiny.|Fresh
Love and Friendship is the purest distillation of Jane Austen's work yet to grace the screen.|Fresh
It might be Stillman's first period piece (a quite a lovely production it is), but the droll humor and keen eye for social dynamics can be traced throughout his work.|Fresh
...it features an unsympathetic heroine who, while not getting what she wants, achieves something that is perhaps even better. This is not your usual Austen adaptation, Stillman instilling it with an American forthrightness.|Fresh
Immensely charming and laugh-out-loud funny.|Fresh
Stillman has made what may be the broadest and most accessible comedy of his career.|Fresh
Austen-isms walk shoulder to shoulder with Stillman-isms so gracefully that it takes a moment to realize which author is likely speaking through these characters.|Fresh
"Who better to adapt Jane Austen's epistolary novel, Lady Susan, for the screen than our finest contemporary observer of life among the ""haute bourgeoisie,"" Whit Stillman?"|Fresh
The wit comes so quickly, the film demands a second viewing. The heartlessness of the central character, though, makes that option unappealing.|Fresh
"""Love & Friendship"" more than delivers on the comedy of manners front, but it's also a very funny, unapologetic portrait of a diabolically clever woman ..."|Fresh
It's the Whit Stillman movie that some of us have been waiting a long time for, and also a Jane Austen movie that goes some way toward correcting the record of dull and dutiful cinematic Janeism.|Fresh
One of the most ingenious movies of recent memory and also the funniest.|Fresh
Beckinsale is fantastic and probably has the funniest and snarkiest lines in the movie. It's better than Stillman's last few movies.|Fresh
The sharpest, least sentimental and possibly the best version of Austen yet.|Fresh
The language, a lyrical blend of Jane Austen and Whit Stillman, bewitches even as it stings. A sublime Kate Beckinsale digs into the role of her career. Pure pleasure.|Fresh
Love & Friendship gives off a lovely, restrained glow at a time in films when almost everything else has the subtlety of headlights.|Fresh
Whit Stillman has made an Austen movie that doesn't, for a change, feel like the corset's tied too tight.|Fresh
As necessarily discomfiting as it is gleefully droll.|Fresh
Stillman gives the romantic roundelay a deliciously modern feminist twist that ends up being a bit too slight and patly resolved, but over all too soon.|Fresh
Beckinsale is the main attraction, delivering hilariously cutting lines with the casual cheeriness of someone who can't even conceive of caring what others might think of her. But she's ably supported by the entire ensemble ...|Fresh
These are tidings of great joy for admirers of the English novelist, who have longed for the day when some canny filmmaker would decide to foreground her satirical wit, which is especially sharp when aimed at tangled issues of class and gender.|Fresh
Stillman and Beckinsale's collaboration has gifted the actress with what might be a career best performance; it's definitely an endlessly entertaining one.|Fresh
"Stillman's rounded-out and embroidered telling is the kind of movie people call ""delicious,"" ""sparkling,"" and ""a comic romp,"" and it is indeed all of those."|Fresh
A delicious marriage of Whit Stillman and Jane Austen in a comedy of manners with a contemporary spin that delights from start to twisty finish.|Fresh
With the plotting and the epigrams taken care of, Stillman seems liberated as a craftsman: Never before has one of his films been so crisp, so tart, so laugh-out-loud funny.|Fresh
Maybe the best big-screen Jane Austen adaptation ever!|Fresh
No Austen adaptation, even the most revisionist ones, has ever felt as vicious as Whit Stillman's Love & Friendship.|Fresh
The delight of its director, Whit Stillman, enlivens every scene, so what might have seemed stilted is full of human faces in exquisitely subtle states of panic. Heretical as it sounds, Stillman has improved on his source.|Fresh
The charmingly manipulative Love & Friendship shouldn't be as periodically enchanting as it is, but dammit if Kate Beckinsale doesn't hypnotize us from scene one.|Fresh
Not among the best of Jane Austen's novels is given a decent adaptation.|Fresh
Streaked with the director's decidedly modern strain of cynicism, Love & Friendship might very well be the most faithful translation of Austen's biting humor and highly practical feminism to date.|Fresh
Above all (and surely to the relief of those prone to resist costume drama) it's just a very playful picture.|Fresh
The stuffiness of the environment, with the beautiful mansions and elegant gowns, seems to have prodded Stillman to be even more playful than usual here.|Fresh
The most refreshing take on Austen's work ever put on screen.|Fresh
One of the funniest comedies of manners since the heyday of Ernst Lubitsch.|Fresh
Whit Stillman relishes societal pomposity and self-obsessed characters, and his latest film, Love & Friendship, shows that he's adept at skewering ridiculous relationships and selfish people no matter what setting.|Fresh
[Stillman's] dry sense and cutting sensibility are suited to the meaner edge this story has in comparison with the rest of Austen's oeuvre.|Fresh
Whitman respects and relishes in Austen's creation but is no slave to it, inventing additional characters to help the story flow.|Fresh
Whit Stillman and Jane Austen are a match made in comedy rapture.|Fresh
Finally, a Jane Austen movie that's fresh and deliciously rotten at the same time.|Fresh
Despite its period trappings, Stillman's film never feels stilted, largely thanks to his bracingly modern heroine who takes no prisoners, and makes no apologies for her conniving behavior.|Fresh
It's pure fun, suitable for most everyone -- and a worthy addition to the Austen canon.|Fresh
The film is a fine showcase for Stillman's typically inspired bon mots and the atypical charms of his leading lady.|Fresh
In the case of Love & Friendship, the match between adaptor and adaptee is exquisite and advantageous to both.|Fresh
Jane Austen, who used dialogue as a veil that reveals and conceals, and writer-director Whit Stillman, with his love for the elegant pense, are such an obvious match that you wonder why it took them this long to get together.|Fresh
...Whit Stillman's adaptation of Jane Austen's Lady Susan is a surprisingly hilarious period piece that centers on Austen's titular character, played perfectly by a deliciously nefarious Kate Beckinsale|Fresh
Perhaps only by reading the book after you've seen this is the skill of Stillman's treatment to be fully grasped - it's one of the deftest feats of literary interpolation in ages.|Fresh
Stillman's fleet and funny adaptation makes it a pleasure to follow these entanglements (and to understand the strict social rules regulating everyone's behavior).|Fresh
A lovely and intricate web with a seductive spider at the center, played deftly by Kate Beckinsale.|Fresh
"""Love & Friendship"" is a most particular pleasure."|Fresh
Whether debutants in New York City or landed gentry in England, Stillman is perfectly at home, delivering the same dry humor and tender observations about the affairs of the highest echelons of society.|Fresh
"Sharp insight, coupled with the amusing way that the heroine phrases her quips, make ""Love & Friendship"" pleasurable to watch even when it all starts to feel like too much about too little."|Fresh
Although it's difficult even by the end to entirely sort out who's related to whom and how, the actors acquit themselves nicely, and it's always good to have Stephen Fry around in this sort of tony affair ...|Fresh
"A supremely elegant and delicately filigreed adaptation of Jane Austen's epistolary novella ""Lady Susan."""|Fresh
With his ebullient and scaldingly droll latest - a superlative screwball adaptation of Jane Austen's novella 'Lady Susan' - Stillman may have finally located an ensemble of characters who exist in their own time.|Fresh
