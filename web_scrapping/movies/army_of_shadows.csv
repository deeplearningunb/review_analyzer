As close to a masterpiece as any film you're likely to see this year.|Fresh
|Fresh
A film to be seen and savored for its moral magnitude.|Fresh
From the first sight of German soldiers goose-stepping past the Arc de Triomphe to a postscript that spells out the fate of characters whose moral confusion is all too real, Army of Shadows is a movie of its time -- and ours.|Fresh
For anyone interested in the impact of war on ordinary men, Army of Shadows proves a sobering and invaluable experience.|Fresh
This memorable movie movingly pays tribute to those who chose not to remain silent, to those ordinary men and women who chose to do extraordinary things... from the shadows.|Fresh
The greatness of Army of Shadows comes from the way it is able to convey many of the cruel paradoxes of war. What is an intimate and messy affair for some ends up being a remote and tactical exercise for others.|Fresh
"""Jean-Pierre Melville cherishes paradox and free thinking,"" and both elements are on beautiful display in his masterpiece."|Fresh
one of those blessed pictures in which all elements, from its writing through to its editing, coalesce into a work of profound philosophical and emotional unity|Fresh
after falling out with the filmmaker on Le Deuxieme Souffle, Lino Ventura agreed to work with Melville again only on condition that they never speak directly to each other on set.|Fresh
As bleak as it is compelling, it will leave you wondering if these freedom fighters haven't done more damage to each other than they have to the Nazi aggressors.|Fresh
a film that tests your nerves and will, which is why it is such a fitting portrait of men and women risking their lives for a pursuit they may never live to see successful|Fresh
|Fresh
a stunning, globetrotting spy masterpiece|Fresh
It took decades for the film to be rediscovered, reassessed and proclaimed a masterpiece.|Fresh
Rich in the elegance, assurance and quasi-formality that often define Melville's style.|Fresh
The fascination comes in minute observation of the Resistance soldiers' mannerisms, demeanor and interaction.|Fresh
It's hard to believe that Melville's 1969 masterpiece--one of the most accurate chronicles of the French Resistance--never got released in the US until 2006; Splendidly acted, this film draws on the helmer's own experience.|Fresh
"Although it has several suspenseful sequences, ""Shadows"" is not a spy thriller, precisely. It's much more along the lines of a melancholy mood piece..."|Fresh
A superb contribution from an A-class film-maker.|Fresh
One of the masterpieces of its era and its genre.|Fresh
ARMY OF SHADOWS is a remarkable and superb film, and American audiences should be rejoicing that is finally (if belatedly) has reached theaters.|Fresh
A fascinating picture of bureaucratic drudgery, even in the middle of war and occupation.|Fresh
|Fresh
Unlike the romantic images of freedom fighters perpetuated by the popular media, Melville's movie is stripped of self-congratulatory hero worship and other puffery.|Fresh
There is nothing more to say, except 'Go.'|Fresh
Rare is the film that actually improves with time. Among that handful is the 1969 French thriller Army of Shadows.|Fresh
Melville stages riveting set pieces, tense little nuggets of men striking in the dark and dealing out death.|Fresh
It's a haunting and sublime work that offers a realistic but horrific account of the underground Resistance.|Fresh
Place it squarely in the category of overlooked gems.|Fresh
Its lack of sentimentality and melodrama is what elevates this thriller to another level.|Fresh
Characterizations as thin as those in Army of Shadows would detract from most movies, but here, they give the movie strength. Melville's point is that the people themselves are not as important as their cause.|Fresh
... more than lives up to its reputation.|Fresh
... a riveting account of life among the French Resistance during World War II's Nazi occupation.|Fresh
Watching it evokes a combination of pity for [the protagonists'] naive idealism and awe at Melville's uncanny brilliance.|Fresh
Another masterpiece on Melville's resume.|Fresh
The result is in many ways the height of Melville's splicings of daredevil, adventure-story heroics and exceedingly grim twists of fate.|Fresh
Its moral is just as relevant today as it ever was during the resistance years -- that the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.|Fresh
It doesn't require a lot of dialog and action to create a mood; instead it fills the screen with tension and the constant threat of danger.|Fresh
A painstaking study in courage and conviction under agonizing pressure.|Fresh
Austere yet probing portrait of the French resistance...beautifully made and thoroughly engrossing.|Fresh
Taut, superb acting, narrative told by mood rather than action, the understated visuals, the elements of 'Army of Shadows' merge to seep in under the skin and create an unforgettable and disturbing experience.|Fresh
Escapism in Melville's cinema inevitably gives way to existentialism; pure entertainment becomes unattainable.|Fresh
There is little safety in Army of Shadows, and its dangers add up humanly, not melodramatically (to call it a 'war film' seems trite).|Fresh
Melville outlines the valorous and dirty deeds of heroes in taut action sequences that reach unusually existential heights. [Blu-ray]|Fresh
In [Melville's] stark and unvarnished film, the violence is routine and ugly, the moral choices painful and uncertain, the relationships deep yet fragile, the victories costly and ephemeral.|Fresh
Deals with the French resistance during World War II, but it's nothing like any other French resistance film ever made.|Fresh
Hopefully, this re-release will spawn new interest and permit the real film buff the chance to see what has been hidden from us for over 35 years.|Fresh
If anything, the vision is more fatalistic than any of Melville's crime classics.|Fresh
Like all Melville's films, it's as cold as cold can be and completely free of exhilarating heroics.|Fresh
The results bear witness to a time when sacrifice was bleached of everything but itself.|Fresh
Melville's impressionistic look at the Resistance is without a doubt the best war film I never knew existed.|Fresh
Masterfully restrained yet frequently nerve-wracking, with sequences on par with Hitchcock at his most tension-filled, this film is one of Melville's best.|Fresh
What's so devastating about Army of Shadows is how physically we respond to the terrible decisions faced by the resistance fighters.|Fresh
Rarely has a film shown so truly that place in the heart where hope lives with fatalism.|Fresh
It becomes overwhelming as we watch -- a classic of life in the underground, of terror, love, friendship, betrayal, and of death hovering over all.|Fresh
A morally ambiguous look at the necessity, the perversity and, sometimes, the generosity of death during wartime.|Fresh
It is arguably the tensest, hardest-edged movie of Melville's career ... and that's saying something.|Fresh
... the most meaningful atmosphere of exquisite suspense you're likely to see at the movies this year. Or most years.|Fresh
Masterfully made, with no detail unattended.|Fresh
Movies don't get any better than this.|Fresh
It's a strange enough film, yet weirdly great. No movie has quite gotten the clammy weight of fear, the sense of hopelessness that would necessarily haunt underground workers.|Fresh
[Those] with a weakness for dry heroism, dark-toned humor, and storytelling of pantherish pace and grace -- in short, lovers of cinema -- should reach for their fedoras, turn up the collars of their coats, and sneak to this picture through a mist of rain.|Fresh
The cast of characters is small and well-drawn by an ensemble of veteran actors.|Fresh
... taut tale of intrigue and daring ...|Fresh
Almost 40 years after it was made, Army of Shadows has more to tell us about the internal toll of war and taking a stand than anything Hollywood has produced.|Fresh
... a riveting historical film noir.|Fresh
[A] rare work of art that thrills the senses and the mind.|Fresh
Melville milks the tension for all its worth.|Fresh
Emerges from the mists of time in a new 35mm restoration as a career-capping epic tragedy.|Fresh
Another Melville masterpiece|Fresh
Not a bad effort -- but filled with credibility gaps and much in need of tightening.|Rotten
Disarmingly restrained and terrifyingly tense.|Fresh
A work of moving ideological commitment as well as beautifully detailed orchestration.|Fresh
Melville handles with consummate cinematic mastery the suspenseful set-pieces.|Fresh
Jean-Pierre Melville's Army of Shadows finally emerges from anonymity this April to assume its rightful canonical place alongside the French master's peerless Parisian noirs.|Fresh
The action is tense. Dark shadows and long moody silences predominate. The dialogue is clipped and sparse: Melville's heroes are men and women of few words and big deeds.|Fresh
The film is long and episodic, strangely divided between art-house enigmas and melodramatic payoffs for the matinee crowd.|Rotten
[Features] very strong performances.|Fresh
