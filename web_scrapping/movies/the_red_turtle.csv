A beautifully crafted epic from Studio Ghibli that takes a simple story and expands it with superb visuals and unexpected power and grace.|Fresh

The finest love letter imaginable to what is quickly becoming an obsolete art.|Fresh
The touch of magic realism doesn't help you escape the feeling that this arthouse Fantasy Island is a feature-length inspirational poster.|Rotten
It's an admirable film and beautiful and entertaining but you feel the weight of the world in it, a sense of gloom that doesn't lift.|Fresh
"Though the tone of ""Turtle"" is very adult - the younger set may squirm despite its very lean 80-minute run time - it is perfectly family friendly. It's a thing of quiet beauty that is exceptionally rare in the world of animation."|Fresh
It's like a minimalist watercolor version of a Pixar silent where monsters and villains are entirely absent, replaced by the inevitable ebb and flow of seasons and time passing.|Fresh
Animation, handmade, is highly creative and, above all, functional to the story that is told. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Red Turtle is a work of art as universal in theme and reach as diverse as the French, Japanese and Dutch influences of its production. It delights in the symbiosis of man and nature, and the circle of life we all share.|Fresh

"""The Red Turtle"" is a rare creature, an 80-minute animated film with no dialogue (unless ""Hey!"" counts) that is both beautiful and harrowing, joyful and melancholy."|Fresh
There is not a lot of plot -- lest we forget that simply living is its own story -- with the film instead growing increasingly existential and even experiential (the exquisite animation and sound design is quite transporting).|Fresh
Leaves it up to use to find metaphoric meaning.|Fresh
With nary a word, The Red Turtle manages to speak in lofty, unconvincing tones.|Rotten
The Red Turtle is perhaps too serene, overall, to capture the mood of many modern filmgoers, but it has a grace and poetry about it which, together with its charming animation, are bound to win it a dedicated legion of fans.|Fresh
It tells a profound emotional story using only a few simple ingredients, and it only works in animation.|Fresh
Deceptively deep in both its sumptuous visual imagery and in its subtly moving themes, The Red Turtle is a transcendent little gem.|Fresh
This is a film to relax into, to enter as in a dream, and to relish for hours and days afterward.|Fresh
[Michael] Dudok de Wit has made an absorbing and captivating little movie.|Fresh
The Red Turtle is a nearly perfect movie for kids (and adults) of almost any age.|Fresh
It is remarkable how seamless is the blend between de Wit's wry minimalist sensibility and Ghibli's penchant for evoking natural beauty in a style that looks like a water colour had life breathed into it.|Fresh
Although the protagonist never says a word, and although director Michaël Dudok de Wit doesn't explain the fantastic elements that are at the center of the story, The Red Turtle hooks from beginning to end. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Every scene is stunning to look at, and the experience of watching it is both calming and moving.|Fresh
The latest movie from Japan's Studio Ghibli - a fresh take on Robinson Crusoe - breaks with the fantastical Miyazaki style, but sets a new standard for inspired minimalist animation.|Fresh
Ghibli's first animated film directed by a foreigner is a wonder mixture of Japanese and Western sensibilities. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Red Turtle is a truly delightful film that does its parent company proud. Hugely recommended.|Fresh
There's something essential, meditative and soul-soothingly simple about The Red Turtle.|Fresh
The depth and texture on show here - conjured from a surge of pencil marks and watercolour washes - is remarkable. The film is a must for the big screen.|Fresh
A precise and elegant fable, which uses magical realism to wind its elements together, The Red Turtle hints rather than hollers about the emotional bond between man and animal.|Fresh
While admiring the atmospheric animation I was left a little underwhelmed by the ponderous narrative.|Rotten
The images are tamely drawn; the tale is wanly evolved.|Rotten
It's a simple and profound story that is both intimate and universal. This is a beautiful film that must be seen.|Fresh
There are few words, but The Red Turtle doesn't need them: nature is the star of this film.|Fresh
The film is simple, not overwhelmingly meaningful in any kind of thought-provoking way, but it is a beautiful and transporting little mini-world of its own.|Fresh
Small children often experience the world as simultaneously solid and fantastical; De Wit's beautiful film tugs us into that mindset.|Fresh
A bewitching animation about a castaway trying to get off an island -- the sort of film you wish Terrence Malick made.|Fresh
It is a work of art which transcends boundaries of language, culture, geography and age. It is simply magnificent.|Fresh
The Red Turtle is a dialogue-free love story, strange and sparingly supernatural.|Fresh
Refreshingly different and highly recommended, especially if you have ever watched in awe as David Attenborough explains our wonderful world.|Fresh
It's a film about loneliness and the steps we take to overcome it, wrapped up in a delightfully simple story for all ages.|Fresh
One for the desert island films list.|Fresh
The experience is captivating, transcendental even.|Fresh
It's a superb piece of work, beautiful and enigmatic.|Fresh
Dudok de Wit and Ghibli have birthed a pan-continental marvel: a fable-cum-fantasy of a life adrift, aching with tender beauty and awed by nature's extremes.|Fresh
A lush and luminous visual symphony, which celebrates nature as both a furious, deadly force and a soothing source of love, this arthouse animation deserves to draw a big crowd.|Fresh
A breathtaking debut feature, simply drawn, rich in texture, and warm of heart.|Fresh
Studio Ghibli's first international co-production is beautifully crafted and full of wonder.|Fresh
a beautifully moving ode to the rhythms of time and nature and our connection with the worlds we inhabit|Fresh
The mesmerising The Red Turtle casts a spell from the opening scene.|Fresh
Told through gorgeous animation, this is a film that marvelously encompasses life itself, resulting in not just the best animated film of last year, but one of the best of the last several years.|Fresh
With The Red Turtle, where a man's solitude is relieved by a moment of wonder, it's fantastically difficult to decide which is more amazing -- nature's power or humanity's art.|Fresh
Sumptuous, survivalist fable. Because of its leisurely, dreamlike pace, I suspect its appeal will be more to adults than children.|Fresh
So maybe the film tries too hard, and makes you try to think too hard. But there is no doubt that it is a great achievement in the genre, and the ending is truly touching. You may well walk out with a tear to accompany that sigh of relief.|Fresh
Ultimately a mediation not only on what it means to be human but, more significantly, what it means to be as one with the natural order of the world.|Fresh
The Red Turtle is beautifully, brilliantly rendered and storyboarded by Dudok de Wit the old-fashioned way.|Fresh
The Red Turtle more than merits that most overused of descriptors: It's enthrallingly, impressively and mind-blowingly one of a kind.|Fresh
Birth, survival, mating, death: The life experience is reduced to its essentials in this stripped-down, dialogue-free fable...|Fresh
"If you're expecting ""The Red Turtle"" to be a raucous animated tale with anthropomorphic critters conversing in pop-culture cliches, you're in for an acute case of shell shock."|Fresh
It's about as beautifully simple and lithe as an epic visual feast can get, with Ghibli-esque themes about our spiritual connection to nature kept high in the mix, and an overarching bittersweetness that keeps the fantasy grounded in human emotion.|Fresh
Though Dudok de Wit's film is a nominee for Best Animated Feature, it says here it won't win ... Regardless, there are more taxing ways to spend 80 minutes than leisurely absorbing his gorgeously framed, often moving images.|Fresh
The unfussy, semi-realistic ligne claire (clear line) drawing style is a perfect match for the story, and color is used both expressively and symbolically...|Fresh
As this gently powerful story proceeds through the cycle of life, one would have to have a heart harder than a turtle shell not to be moved.|Fresh
The first non-Japanese animation from Studio Ghibli is a simple fable on paper, but this heart-rending depiction of a man stranded on a desert island is a tour de force in visual storytelling.|Fresh
This gorgeously drawn movie is much more than a children's film. It's a meditation on the very meaning of existence, identity and love.|Fresh
A magical and mystical animated film about an island, a castaway, a shapeshifting being, and dreams.|Fresh
The Red Turtle is a thoughtful piece of art and one worth your time. It's one of the best animated films in years.|Fresh
"A one-of-a-kind film that lingers long in the memory, ""The Red Turtle"" suggests that when it comes to animation, there are still whole new worlds to explore."|Fresh
Every single shot in The Red Turtle is perfect.|Fresh
The conflicts presented are few, and the ravishingly beautiful tale is relatively safe for children, although they might miss much of its subtle commentary on accepting and pushing against our limitations.|Fresh
Without a word of dialog, it says more than most animated films could ever hope to.|Fresh
A stellar experience with absolutely top notch animation and sound design from beginning to end.|Fresh
It seems almost churlish to suggest that the mysterious storyline is maybe overly woo-woo and precious.|Fresh
Dutch-born writer/director Michael Dudok de Wit has a distinct minimalist sensibility that shines throughout his first feature-length animated film, The Red Turtle.|Fresh
Lovely to look at, but lesser Ghibli.|Rotten
Whatever your perspective, there's one thing for sure: The Red Turtle is unlike anything else you've seen in a while.|Fresh
I dare you to look away.|Fresh
It is this delicate thing, capable of making an audience laugh and cry and smile all at the same time. It is not to be missed.|Fresh
This is one of those animations that creates a world so beautiful the characters need only wander around in it.|Fresh
"Watching ""The Red Turtle"" ... is like falling into an 80-minute wormhole of spare artistry."|Fresh
Incredibly artful, sincere work that rewards patience with an achingly human story of life and death as it tours the vast recesses of the mind.|Fresh
"Dialogue-free, ""The Red Turtle"" begins at simplicity, then accumulates the most delicate of emotions in one compelling scene after another... superlative visual storytelling. The existential allegories? They'll take care of themselves."|Fresh

A calm, quietly touching beauty, a fable about man, nature, family, the environment -- I don't know, life itself.|Fresh
"It's possible that you will feel slightly underwhelmed by the end, even as you murmur to yourself, ""Well, that was lovely."" But underwhelmed is not quite the same as disappointed."|Fresh
...evokes, in its primeval beauty, something of a seaside Garden of Eden.|Fresh
A magical love story - the romance between a castaway and a natural spirit - that explores the relationship between human beings and nature. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A fable, beautifully drawn in calm, soothing colors, it doesn't even have dialogue, let alone a throbbing soundtrack. Those sounds you hear are the sounds of silence, and eventually they become hypnotic.|Fresh
This is a timeless tale that has no need to shout (or even speak) about how deliriously beautiful it is.|Fresh
A hypnotic story, risky and overflowing with sensitivity that arouses curiosity, tension, surprise, admiration, empathy or emotion. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a beautiful example of what animation as a medium is capable of, of what it can achieve that live-action storytelling cannot.|Fresh
Truth, grace, and simplicity rule in this film, which establishes Dudok de Wit as a rising star in world animation and provides audiences on these shores with a memorably unusual adventure.|Fresh
Beautiful word-free drama about castaway who finds love.|Fresh
The animation of The Red Turtle is exquisite, making the film a visual splendor. But the story itself is almost simplistic to a fault, flirting with the fantastical but not going far enough.|Fresh
A full animated feature of rich themes and breathtaking imagery.|Fresh
Despite the surrealism, the road that this unorthodox family follows is largely universal.|Fresh
Though not a canonical Ghibli picture, the fact that their last two features The Tale of the Princess Kaguya and When Marnie Was There centered on well-conceived female characters makes the gender politics here doubly disappointing.|Rotten
Wholly original, yet informed by legends of both the East and West, it invites us to contemplate humanity's connections to the natural world and the realm of the spirit.|Fresh
This quiet meditation on humans' relationship with nature hews to Ghibli's core values of exquisitely rendered visual images combined with gently ruminative sensibilities.|Fresh
A transcendent masterpiece that speaks volumes without saying a word.|Fresh
Told with simplicity, elegance and no dialogue whatsoever, it's an animated fable about loneliness and hope.|Fresh
It's more sensation than story --more impressionistic than thematic. As an accomplishment alone, it should be held as a landmark... but as a narrative rather than as an object to admire, it struggles to have anything salient to say.|Fresh
If you want to see it as a parable, that's up to you. In all ways, the film plays its hand gently.|Fresh
The lack of dialogue may skew towards the experimental, but The Red Turtle's humanity is completely experiential in a way that matches the best Studio Ghibli joints.|Fresh
The Red Turtle succeeds as both a sumptuous story of humanity's potential for unity with nature and an example of the unique human capacity for understanding through art.|Fresh
...a combination of digital and hand drawn animation which reflects both the beauty and cruelty of nature and man's place within it.|Fresh
A thoroughly disarming fairy tale, one that initially appears familiar, but eventually reveals itself to be something new, and altogether unexpected.|Fresh
... a profound meditation on ingenuity and the human condition.|Fresh
The delicacy of the animated movie The Red Turtle... is so quietly breathtaking that to call it a tone poem doesn't quite do the film justice.|Fresh
Equally enchanting, poetic, sad, breathtaking and mesmerizing. It's among the best Animated films in recent years.|Fresh
Dudok de Wit makes every scene gripping. It also doubles as an example of the universal power of visual storytelling.|Fresh
Should you see The Red Turtle? Yes, definitely if you're willing to take in the hypnotic images without worrying about the plot (which is almost as simple as it seems) or waiting for a telling piece of dialogue.|Fresh
The Red Turtle is an elegant reminder that hand-drawn animation has a unique grace that no CGI animation can replicate, regardless of how well it's executed.|Fresh
"""The Red Turtle"" practices a minor, gentle magic. It wants you to smile and say, ""Ahh,"" rather than gasp and say, ""Wow."""|Fresh
The animators don't overplay the loveliness, preferring subdued colors punctuated by the occasional vivid blue. Red rarely appears, and the many dream sequences are as gray as the night from which they emerge.|Fresh
"""The Red Turtle"" is poetry made cinema, an exquisite existential allegory that says everything without having to say anything at all."|Fresh
Like Ghibli's classic films, especially Hayao Miyazaki's, it lavishes as much attention on the natural world as the creatures who inhabit it.|Fresh
The hand-drawn animation is absolutely gorgeous... Yet I found The Red Turtle to be relentlessly depressing, tainted by cruelty.|Rotten
You can read this gorgeous and soothing semi-fantasy as an honest and gutting look at one man's bottomless guilt - or you could bend your logical mind and accept it as that and so much more.|Fresh
It invites us - as in, anyone who's ever felt stranded - to consider our little spot in the world. Lavish with stunning imagery, the experience will ripple into your dreams.|Fresh
Dudok de Wit modulates our emotions in sophisticated ways, first accessing the awe of The Black Stallion, then straight-up guilt and, finally, an evolution that can't be explained by anything other than hope.|Fresh
A thoughtful film about the cycle of life, and a sublime cinematic achievement. A masterpiece, in fact.|Fresh
Director Michael Dudok de Wit is drawn to transcendental refinement, seeking to provide us refuge from the excess of our world.|Fresh
A fable of love to the union of respect and armony with Nature, which doesn't need words to convey the breadth of nuances within the relationship between the shipwrecked and the mysterious turtle. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Red Turtle is a wondrous work of animation, that will surprise with how it hides profundity within its seemingly simplistic narrative.|Fresh
Rich, dense, and delicately devastating in its examination of the parts of life that truly matter.|Fresh
Add The Red Turtle to the growing stack of largely disappointing films from Ghibli's new generation of untested directors.|Rotten
"""The Red Turtle"" is a visually stunning poetic fable, but there's more on its mind than simply beauty."|Fresh
Though some may find its allusiveness and magical-realist turns to be overly fanciful, The Red Turtle nevertheless remains throughout a simple, gripping story of survival ...|Fresh
The Red Turtle will make you want to ... discover your own private island paradise.|Fresh
The movie is so rich with texture, pattern, and subtle color effects and gradations that you're not just seeing a drawing move but running your hands over the imaginary paper the living images are flickering over.|Fresh
Although it's a stylistic leap from Studio Ghibli's beloved classics, its contemplation of such familiar themes will no doubt resonate with soot sprite and river spirit fans alike.|Fresh
There's no doubt that The Red Turtle is charming and enchanting, but it's muted tone, leisurely pace and jarring lack of dialogue in the last half make for a less emotive conclusion than the simple story could have earned.|Rotten
An enchanting, serene feature that makes for an ineffably moving, and truly engaging cinematic experience.|Fresh
The Red Turtle is about the importance of life, big or small, and its interconnectedness. It's a beautiful and thoughtful film.|Fresh
Dudok de Wit's sparse work acquires the power of a fable, leaping years and revealing images that have the timeless power of cave drawings. The final scenes are resolutely simple but deeply powerful, encapsulating life's passage.|Fresh
The island's gorgeous to look at, but that beauty hides a darker side - and that's just as true for The Red Turtle.|Fresh
Everything about this fantastical story is enchantingly simple. But don't be fooled by its almost meditative mood, The Red Turtle is one of the most affecting films of the year.|Fresh
To this viewer, too, The Red Turtle resembles a short film padded to feature length, and I confess that its 80 minutes felt very long.|Rotten
The Red Turtle is an exquisite piece of art, a breathless celebration of nature, and an achingly beautiful story of survival against all odds that feels like a fairy tale in its delivery. In other words, it is essential viewing.|Fresh
A simple but deep animation jewel that sticks in your head for hours after leaving the movie theater. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Dudok de Wit tells his tale in deft, economical strokes, without adding superfluous detail.|Fresh
The Red Turtle is one of the more subtle films of the year so far, relying heavily on the omnipresent touch of spirituality and the connective tissue of humans and nature.|Fresh
Unlikely as it sounds, this strangely compelling allegory is punctuated by nerve-wrecking action scenes, as the survivors battle against elements and circumstance.|Fresh
A delicate essay on the transience of life and the disproportionate weight that we often put on what is not essential. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
It's a work of beauty; the underwater swimming sequences have the fluidity of ballet, and it is continuously eye-catching, with a simple story line that should easily cross borders.|Fresh
With unpretentious poetry to spare, Dutch illustrator and animator Michael Dudok de Wit winningly expands to feature length the verve that has been evident in his award-winning short films for two decades.|Fresh
Michaël Dudok De Wit excels at producing compelling drama from such extreme self-imposed limitations.|Fresh
This is a quiet little masterpiece of images, each one rich with meaning, that collectively speak to a universal process.|Fresh
Though there isn't a single word of dialogue in the film's 80-minute running time, the big questions it asks, about ambition, acceptance and the beauty of companionship, ring loud in every heart-melting frame.|Fresh
Like The Red Turtle's shipwrecked protagonist, you have to simply stop fighting the current and go with the flow.|Fresh
A fable so simple, so pure, it feels as if it has existed for hundreds of years, like a brilliant shard of sea glass rendered smooth and elegant through generations of retelling.|Fresh
