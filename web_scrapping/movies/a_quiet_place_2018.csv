A Quiet Place is flipping fantastic.|Fresh

10 Best of 2018: Honorable Mention.|Fresh
The sound design is super important toward the narrative and meaning of the film.|Fresh
Whereas so many scary movies are rooted in a backhanded, ironic breed of cynicism - what's more monstrous in monster movies than the people trying to survive the monsters? - A Quiet Place appeals to the better angels of our nature.|Fresh
John Krasinski finalmente abandona la sombra de su entra√±able personaje de The Office para convertirse en una promesa del cine de horror.|Fresh

You would want to scream but also you wouldn't want to scream. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

This unique horror film offers an emotional resonance that makes it truly stand out.|Fresh
Krasinski blends genres seamlessly and to great effect. It is one of the most intense theater experiences I can remember and yet the familial aspects are just as grounded and touching as the monster moments are terrifying.|Fresh
Krasinski steers A Quiet Place far beyond its intriguing premise to a place that I want to visit as often as possible.|Fresh
"""A Quiet Place"" could go down as a modern horror classic"|Fresh

I could feel myself being expertly manipulated by every single person who worked on the movie and I loved them for it.|Fresh
A Quiet Place is a big screen movie through and through, designed for mass audiences to shriek and jump and laugh together.|Fresh

Thinking big, Krasinski goes small.|Fresh
After a promising opening, the holes in the film's conceit and its general flimsiness become increasingly problematic.|Rotten
A ruthless, old-fashioned monster horror that will have audiences around the world resisting a scream and gasping for breath.|Fresh

It has you white-knuckling the arm rests of your seat for almost the entire runtime.|Fresh
Reviewers within the deaf community have had both positive and tempered reactions to A Quiet Place, but what I unabashedly appreciate is Krasinski's insistence on hiring deaf talent to help shape the film.|Fresh
The mediocre nature of the film's actual scares betray what is mostly a thrilling film.|Fresh
Barring a few logistical holes ... A Quiet Place is a taut ninety-minutes of unfiltered dread and suspense.|Fresh
A creature feature where the monsters are genuinely terrifying.|Fresh
Krasinski charges this film with many meanings, each of which can devastate a person. The silence is literal for these characters, but it's also metaphorical.|Fresh
A film about silence shouldn't be this loud.|Rotten
Almost every scene is a throbbing set piece, because the premise pivots on the very core of human nature.|Fresh
An ingenious concept from which the film wrings every bit of almost unbearable tension and gasp-worthy shocks.|Fresh
I'm just glad that Krasinski showed us the monsters.|Fresh
I think they did an awesome job creating tension with each sound, and the monster was great.|Fresh
It was really intense...I liked the way they built up the tension...the kids were great.|Fresh
While it works on the level of surviving an onslaught of otherworldly beings, its true merit comes in how that onslaught exposes humanity-through both heroism and failure.|Fresh
Krasinski co-writes, directs and stars in the smart, nerve-wracking gut-punch of a monster flick, A Quiet Place.|Fresh
This movie is a winner on every level...I won't be shocked at all if people start talking about A Quiet Place getting Oscar buzz.|Fresh
As a simple, modern horror, A Quiet Place demonstrates a deft and canny ability to turn the minutiae of everyday monotony into the stuff of nightmares.|Fresh
Krasinksi proves an astutely skilled study in genre and manages to administer the difficult balance of emotional depth and high anxiety throughout the course of a simplistic metaphor on parenthood.|Fresh
"But the difficulty does not lie in the lack of verbiage, but in our prohibitions. We're an ableist society, often fearful of the ""arduous"" journey that comes with empathizing with the deaf."|Fresh
A Quiet Place sits comfortably in the fun, poppy subgenre of horror, a popcorn thriller more than a dread-infused meditation on terror, but manages to play around with its own setting and characters enough to stand out.|Fresh
"Honestly, this is what the latest ""Cloverfield"" movie should've been."|Fresh
Alongside Blunt, the other actors all handle expressing heightened emotions without being able to use their voices extremely well, especially deaf actor Millicent Simmonds... where the ability to hear is a matter of life or death.|Fresh

This is a suspense/horror movie that ironically will give audiences a lot to talk about.|Fresh
Krasinski served up a horror-thriller unlike any other with A Quiet Place.|Fresh
If the creatures are somewhat of a let-down, Emily Blunt more than makes up for it.|Fresh
A Quiet Place may be reactionary, but it only wants to be entertainment, the same way Affleck and Gibson movies do. The goal in this one is effective horror.|Rotten
The universe of A Quiet Place doesn't stretch any farther than the Abbott family can travel on foot, which allows Krasinski to tell a taut and empathetic story about a family trying to survive together.|Fresh
A combo of a fable about a family banding together and a technical exercise that works the nerves, and it worked mine while it flickered in front of me, but it has left me with sense-memories of being jostled and worked over and not much else.|Fresh
Few horror films root their narratives as deeply within their audio design, and Paramount's fine-tuned Blu-ray of A Quiet Place should be an essential addition to the libraries of fans and audiophiles alike.|Fresh
The best horror movies find inspiration in the limits of their hypothesis... and in its final moments, A Quiet Place both solves and acknowledges the latent goofiness of its premise.|Fresh
A Quiet Place is truly a revelation. A simple premise turns out to be an intense, exciting, poignant and ridiculously scary story.|Fresh
A Quiet Place, John Krasinski's first horror movie, is kind of a laughable exercise.|Rotten
Don't watch it alone!|Fresh
Stripped down to its barest elements and just barely scraping by the 90-minute mark, it's devilish in its simplicity.|Fresh

As in all the best horror films, the tropes address primal fears in ways that are simpler to process, but no less unsettling because of it. It's also got one of the best fade to black moments in recent filmdom.|Fresh
The inanities it requires of its characters are pushing it even for a monster movie.|Rotten
A Quiet Place could be placed in the horror genre, but it's so much more than that. It's a love story, a rich tapestry of family life.|Fresh

Sure, it's just a movie but A Quiet Place is so effective that you'll be deathly afraid of making a sound - just like the main characters.|Fresh
A marvelous film that is genuinely frightening, without the zeal or polish of a routine studio picture where all the scares are conducted to convention.|Fresh
This is a gem that is held together by two transparent Pilars: mise-en-scene and sound design. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
One can't help think about how bombastic most modern films are and how few have utilized silence to such artful effect as Krasinski and his team do in this taut, spare thriller.|Fresh
The ingredient that puts this very effective little horror gem over the top is Emily Blunt. Thousands of actresses have played women in peril in horror movies, but Blunt shows you the value of shelling out for one from the A-List.|Fresh

The breathless opening reveals Krasinski's sophisticated filmmaking approach, setting up the premise and showcasing the meticulous attention to detail that will turn his lean story into a masterclass of tension.|Fresh

An absolute blast that you can only experience to its fullest inside a packed theater with a QUIET audience, of course.|Fresh
[John Krasinksi's] strength shows here in his ability to nurture a concept into a living, breathing movie.|Fresh
The beast that lives in the head of serious filmgoers, that slaughters those who talk, rustle, munch, stomp up and down the aisle and check text messages, is literalised on screen for the first time.|Fresh
This means that the experience of watching the movie is extremely tense-any loud footstep, any accidentally knocked-over object could mean almost-instant death for the characters.|Fresh
A Quiet Place is a gem of a horror film. It's high on tension, low on gore and a great option for a night out with friends -- or anyone else who enjoys a big screen scare.|Fresh
Though accompanied with a rich score by Marco Beltrami, A Quiet Place communicates the power and simplicity of the silent cinema.|Fresh
And for a film where sound is so important to the lives of the characters, Krasinski doesn't really pay all that much heed to the sound design of his film.|Rotten
"""A Quiet Place"" is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had watching a movie, and is already being heralded by many critics as a genre-redefining classic."|Fresh

It can take a little while for a movie to reel audiences in but A Quiet Place will hook them from the very opening scene.|Fresh
The film is perfectly structured... It doesn't change the rules of the game. It doesn't create new elements. Nor does it cheat, although some parts of the plot depend on inconveniences that are a little too convenient. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

The acting and craftsmanship here put this in the top 10% of B-grade scares and make this a crackling piece of entertainment.|Fresh
The actors are so strong that it's easy to identify with them, seeing thoughts flash across their faces moments before they are required to make a fateful decision.|Fresh
It's a clever premise brilliantly realized, and never less than a big-screen blast.|Fresh
Krasinski and screenwriters Bryan Woods and Scott Beck ensure that this is as much about the family as it is the monster stuff, and therefore it's surprisingly moving at times.|Fresh
What happens on the screen isn't as important as what goes on in the hearts, minds, and ears of those of us who surrender to the powerful allure of this not so quiet place. Listen to the lesson.|Fresh
A Quiet Place is so unmoored from anything like subtext or complexity that without a keenly intelligent and efficient script, its seams start to show almost immediately.|Rotten
I have not seen any of the two previous films by Krasinski but at least here it is more than clear that we are facing a real filmmaker.|Fresh
If there's anything that makes A Quiet Place worth seeing, it's that it is a rare experience to sit in the cinema in complete silence. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

"Recent attempts at ""smart horror"" didn't offer up reality but they did have an internal logic for the world the films created. A Quiet Place fails this basic test."|Rotten
A Quiet Place is a movie built around a gimmick, but it's been jerry-rigged awfully well.|Fresh
It's Blunt who does the really heavy-lifting here, albeit playing a role almost as old as cinema itself: the beautiful woman in terrible danger.|Fresh
[Blunt is] excellent, as is her husband's film.|Fresh
A Quiet Place keys into some primal emotions, as well as shredding your nerves, sometimes both at the same time.|Fresh
A modern suspense classic. Krasinski delivers a unique cinematic experience from start to finish. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is about as terrifying as movies get. Superb performances and expertly directed.|Fresh
While almost everything about A Quiet Place works perfectly, the best stuff goes unsaid, which is certainly appropriate.|Fresh
Eerie and angst-riddled, it's a tour-de-force for John Krasinksi and an unsettling, totally different kind of creature feature.|Fresh
The concept is pure and perfectly suited to the genre, and it's a brilliant conceit because it makes you a part of the experience. When you watch A Quiet Place, you'll sit glued to your seat in a theater so quiet you can hear a pin drop.|Fresh
You'll root for the Abbotts till your cheeks are sodden. All hail a blockbuster that's ultra-sound. And pray that it blows the competition away.|Fresh

It's one thing to stumble upon an idea so straightforward and pure - 'Lights Out,' a terrific 2016 horror movie, had one - that it's a wonder it hasn't been used before. It's yet another thing to execute it so impeccably so as to have not wasted it.|Fresh

The film's effectiveness arises, rather, from the elimination of everything inessential and a steady focus on teamwork both on and off-screen.|Fresh
A Quiet Place is not a great movie but it is a good one that takes what could have just been a simple-minded gimmick movie and turns it into something better.|Fresh
John Krasinski mines some gut-wrenching tension out of A Quiet Place's ingenious premise.|Fresh

If this were simply a thespian throw-down, the wordless women would crush the berserker aliens in no time.|Fresh

It's said that the most of the 'horror' in classic horror films is derived from the sound effects and background score. Director John Krasinski has turned that dictum upon its head.|Fresh
Way overrated M. Night Shyamalan-type sci-fi-horror hybrid with serious credibility issues and too many jump in your face moments.|Rotten

For the entire night after I saw A Quiet Place I thought every sound was too loud.|Fresh
Despite not bleeding us all the way out, it's still a genuinely eerie experience.|Fresh
Best horror movie in a couple of decades. Some scenes are so terrifying and intense that you'll find yourself unable to breath. In the end you'll need your own quiet place.|Fresh
A gripping, edge of your seat thriller that's tight and effective in generating the scares by manipulating those old reptilian parts of our brains we still carry around with us. (Full Content Parental Review - Violence, Scares, etc. - also Available)|Fresh

Like Aliens retooled as a militant librarian's fantasy, John Krasinski's relentless shocker thrives on a nifty premise.|Fresh
A Quiet Placeis a thoroughly relatable thriller laced with horror-movie tropes. Perhaps that's why it works so well even for a wimp like me. The movie runs 90 minutes and is thoroughly satisfying. Other filmmakers would do well to take note of this.|Fresh

A winner in every way.|Fresh
Krasinski... doesn't just direct the film -- he conducts it.|Fresh

"I can't recall the last time I found myself caring as intently for the characters in a horror picture as I did for the family in ""A Quiet Place""..."|Fresh

Working from a script he wrote with Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, director Krasinski exhibits a sure sense of what will hold the audience, moment to moment.|Fresh
Krasinski has made one of the most poetic horror movies of recent years. Its sound design alone is glorious, locating the infinite gradations in that thing we so casually call silence.|Fresh
An edge-of-your-seat family drama that just happens to have monsters.|Fresh
Isn't an earth-shaking addition to the horror genre, but it's a good example of what a clever concept can achieve when slickly rendered.|Fresh
If you're looking for a film that will keep you thrillingly off-balance, this is the place.|Fresh
If ever a film had me mentally tiptoeing over a booby-trapped carpet of eggshells while quietly gibbering with anxiety, it's this brutal sci-fi suspense thriller...|Fresh
"Forget ""Get out!"" and ""Don't go in there!"" Creepy new fright fest A Quiet Place amps its fear with a simple ""Shhh."""|Fresh
Krasinski may take it all very seriously, but that doesn't make it serious. I don't think that's the movie's intended takeaway, but as I laughed my way into the aisle after it was over, it was the only one that seemed to stick.|Rotten
The film's nail-biting tension makes for pleasing genre thrills and a conduit for parental anxiety. As good a film as you'll see this year.|Fresh
...an undeniably tense picture that demonstrates John Krasinski's skills behind the camera. Be quiet, walk carefully, and go see it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director-star Krasinski creates a new horror classic about a family that can only stay alive if no one makes a sound. Emily Blunt delivers a tour de force of silent emotion as approaching monsters fry your nerves to a frazzle.|Fresh
In a genre that has often been plagued by nudge-nudge, wink-wink storytelling, the simple honesty of a family facing impossible odds and eking through is truly chilling.|Fresh
"Deliciously coiled tension arrives briskly and often in ""A Quiet Place,"" a near-silent thriller with a humdinger conceit. The unnerving terror threatening to boil to the surface at any moment is where the film most excels."|Fresh
"Something this silent and shockingly effective reminds us how barraged with noise we are by most movies, and how essentially empty that noise is. (""THX! The audience is listening!"" No, they're not. They're numbed to the experience)."|Fresh
"...the Abbotts have restructured their family life into ""A Quiet Place."" And that aspect of the film...is one of the continuing pleasures of John Krasinski's tense, beautifully crafted and acted third film."|Fresh
The most innovative horror film since The Blair Witch Project. The unbeatable frontrunner for scary movie of the year.|Fresh
We don't get many thrill rides of this caliber, and we don't often get to see a level of talent erupt in such ferocity as we do here. This is a monster movie for the ages.|Fresh
Tension is carefully amplified in this stripped-down scenario up to the halfway point, then the jeopardy ratchets up and doesn't quit. After a lean 95 minutes, you'll be spat out, panting and demolished.|Fresh
Despite a somewhat too tidy ending, it's a terrific movie, beautifully made and carried along by strong performances and skillful storytelling.|Fresh
A Quiet Place is brief, taut and often quite terrifying.|Fresh
Krasinski's assured and confident direction speedily sweeps us over these minor speed bumps with skin-crawling jump-scares and showcase sequences.|Fresh
The central concept isn't terribly original, but Krasinski's treatment of it is unadorned and fresh. The movie grabs you at the start and never lets go.|Fresh
Besides having a double-barrelled surname that would suit any self-respecting jam band, the Krasinski-Blunts are indomitable together.|Fresh
This movie is so stressful.|Fresh
In its convincing portrayal of a situation where a rusty nail is as lethal as an unexploded bomb, and the few remaining inhabitants seem - much like the audience - more likely to die of stress than anything else, the movie rocks.|Fresh
Krasinski makes suspension of disbelief easy, and the movie mostly works - I can't remember the last time I was in a movie theater so quiet.|Fresh
There‚Äôs plenty...that doesn‚Äôt hold up to scrutiny and even more that feels conspicuously derivative. But tell that to your pants as you pee them.|Fresh
The result is frightening, and it feels wholly original.|Fresh
[Noah] Jupe is poignantly convincing - a perpetually worried middle-aged man in a child's body - while [Millicent] Simmonds' Regan is so formidable in her adolescent rebelliousness that it all seems wasted on a mere alien.|Fresh
A Quiet Place isn't revolutionary, relying on enough abrupt shocks and grisly effects to satisfy chronic horror fans. But it works better as a mutation of the genre, placing aural dread ahead of visceral gore.|Fresh
You can't deny the film's effectiveness. Krasinski has crafted a very scary and surprisingly affecting horror movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.|Fresh
A nerve-shredding thriller tense from the opening scene to the very end.|Fresh
For my first watch, I was glued. This movie makes you reflect on human beings in general...A Quiet Place is really unique.|Fresh
Easily the best film Krasinski has made, and it features the finest performance he's ever given, constructing a classy B-movie that explores the foundation of familial relationships, but also delivers sizable chills from total silence.|Fresh
"Fear can sharpen the senses. In ""A Quiet Place,"" it also helps Krasinski fine-tune his filmmaking."|Fresh
Pure visual storytelling class.|Fresh
The collective, dread-inducing moan I heard from the audience around me at that reveal is surely what horror filmmakers live for more than the shock and gore. (Because it's real suspense; like Hitchcock's ticking bomb under the table, we know it's there.)|Fresh
In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared down and very original affair.|Fresh
Size isn't everything. Witness the miniaturist marvel that is A Quiet Place.|Fresh

See enough scary movies and you start to anticipate when to cover your eyes. What makes A Quiet Place such a terrifying entry in the genre is that you need to know when to cover your ears.|Fresh

Catch this film if you are curious about how silence can be so captivating.|Fresh
It is smart, it moves fast, it has a hugely satisfying ending -- and it deserves to attract a much broader audience than the usual horror film devotees.|Fresh
Krasinski directs himself well, as the solid, protective fatherly presence. But he wisely throws most of the movie to Emily Blunt, who turns out to be a strong silent film actress.|Fresh
An apocalypse unlike any onscreen before. A film often almost unbearably tense, in part because it audaciously reconsiders the role sound plays in eliciting our emotional response.|Fresh
At just 90 minutes, A Quiet Place is brisk, but it's also patient; this is one of those monster movies that builds tension from the absence of the monster...|Fresh
A Quiet Place is completely gripping, and in a film fully reliant on facial communication, exquisitely acted by those amazing kids, and by Krasinski and Blunt, who've never been better.|Fresh
What is most satisfying here is not just the effective frights that unpredictably punctuate the family's existence, but the empathy that builds up with them and how moved we are by their plight.|Fresh
A Quiet Place is far from quiet but a horror thriller for the ages.|Fresh
"""A Quiet Place"" is the one film where, if you are surrounded by popcorn-crunching, cellophane rattling and cell-phone-chatting neighbors, you will wish these monsters were real."|Fresh
Krasinski gets terrific performances from everyone: It's a convincing family. Which is nice, in a way, despite the ghastliness of the situation.|Fresh
This may be a sci-fi fantasy about giant man-eating bugs, but it's grounded in human facts and folly. Little here is safe. Nothing is predictable.|Fresh
To Krasinski's credit, he doubles down on this concept, forcing the family of four to communicate through whispers and sign language that is subtitled for the viewers; it successfully transforms all sound into a horror element|Fresh
While the use of sound here is the hook, the success of the film rests almost purely on simple, old-fashioned filmmaking skill, and that's a trick Krasinksi has down cold.|Fresh
I left the cinema not wanting to make noise, for fear of the creatures getting me, and that's the mark of an effective horror movie if I ever heard it.|Fresh
John Krasinski's film turns the act of survival into a powerful statement of defiance against the vagaries of the unknown.|Fresh

Takes a scenario we've seen hundreds of times before - how to survive after the fall of civilisation - and makes it fresh with a superb conceit.|Fresh
Presenting the domestic unit and protective parenting as crucial salves in times of despair, Krasinski finds room for sentiment, even optimism, amid this avalanche of toothy suspense thrills.|Fresh
A Quiet Place, with its extremely well thought-out use of silence and noise, is another one of the new age pioneers that is stretching boundaries. Rarely has a scary movie been so filled with vulnerable protagonists and fraught with abject fear.|Fresh
When A Quiet Place has one finger on the panic button and the other on mute, it's a nervy, terrifying thrill.|Fresh
Despite some B movie residue, in the novelty of the premise and no shortage of 'bump in the night' spooks, it is pro-human and pro-intellectual, reinterpreting 'survival of the fittest' as 'survival of the smartest'.|Fresh

"Sometimes, getting on the clever/whatever wavelength of a horror film and just rolling with can be a part of the fun. ""A Quiet Place"" is that kind of movie."|Fresh

Beyond the fact that the film is an incredible piece of genre storytelling, on a technical level A Quiet Place is an absolute marvel as well, proving that innovation can be so very crucial when it comes to crafting movies in this day and age.|Fresh
