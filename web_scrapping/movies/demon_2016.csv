This is a portrait of Poland as a not-so-sweet little village, unable to move on from small-town xenophobia against Jews like Hana or modern outsiders like Piotr, even as its unresolved past returns, like a dybbuk, to reinhabit the present...|Fresh
The writing and direction of Demon are too sloppy - messy, even - to give  a stable shape to materials as complex as those found in the film.|Rotten
... a provocative mixture of horror movies... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Marcin Wrona is attempting to make a serious movie within a genre framework, and he succeeds in balancing the right amounts of fear, humour, and grotesquerie.|Fresh
[Marcin] Wrona creates an increasingly eerie atmosphere, and a sense of menace so profound, it keeps us engrossed right up to the last frame.|Fresh
. . .Demon shares another common horror film problem -- it doesn't satisfactorily resolve the chaos it has indulged.|Fresh
Demon skips from climax to credits without much in the way of denouement. It feels abrupt, like treading on a step that isn't there.|Fresh
Demon is a powerful movie that, once seen, can't be easily shaken off.|Fresh
[Andrzej Wajda] didn't make this horror film, but his spirit hangs over it.|Fresh
We've seen weddings explored as a chaotic setting in cinema numerous times before, but there's something uniquely compelling and wholly original about what Wrona creates with Demon.|Fresh

Demon isn't a bad film; it's a disappointing one.|Rotten
A fistfight between the bridegroom and one of his guests is the least bad thing that happens at the wedding of Piotr (Itay Tiran) and Zaneta (Agnieszka Zulewska).|Fresh
Ultimately, what lingers most strongly in Wrona's impressive film is less the actual aberration, and more the examination of how people as a group react to it being in their midst.|Fresh
A paranormal descent into madness and mayhem that's hauntingly good.|Fresh
A swift, elegant film about something dark and harrowing resurfacing from the past to cause havoc in the present.|Fresh
Tiran and Zulewska give powerful performances as a man overtaken by a malevolent spirit and the new bride who fights to save him from it.|Fresh
Not only an instant genre classic but also an astute and affecting rumination on the notion that the shades of the past are always with us and can disrupt us to the point of personal and societal collapse.|Fresh
Demon is a fine film steeped deeply in its culture.|Fresh
Demon feels too crowded by half, unable to build the momentum it needs to really get under our skin.|Rotten
For a tale of repressed guilt, Demon sparkles with humor, reveling in the macabre.|Fresh
The past cannot and will not remain covered up. Demon is worth seeing, if only to re-emphasize that.|Fresh
It isn't always out a frighten audiences, but Wrona has some strong ideas about the hollowing out of a man's soul that keeps the effort engrossing.|Fresh
This world and the otherworldly embrace in riotous fashion as the wedding party grows more degenerate and destructive through the night. [D]ark seethes into the greater dark. The ordinary will get you, because the extraordinary is directly beneath it.|Fresh
It's a horror picture that derives from the worst horror of the 20th century -- the Holocaust -- and how its ghosts continue to haunt the people of Poland no matter how hard they try to forget.|Fresh
Classy and contained and, at the same time, wickedly crazed.|Fresh
"You can almost see the filmmaking process with Wrona chumming the waters with macabre tentacles and philosophical probings only to back away and say ""that's it"" sans an explanation or guide-wires."|Fresh
[T]he horrors of the scenario remain unspoken. They're implied just enough that we don't need them to be said.|Fresh
As it reaches its culmination, Demon ends on a particularly mysterious and obscure note but it works all the better for it, ensuring it remains lodged in your thoughts long afterwards.|Fresh
Setting aside its generic and misleading title, Marcin Wrona's Demon is a very eerie tale of possession, and a testament to what can be done without special effects.|Fresh
Demon, Wrona's third and last feature, a Polish-Israeli co-production, is a supernatural film, as well as a family of melodrama and extremely dark comedy.|Fresh
Wrona keeps everything creepily ambiguous right up to the end, when the foggy dawn breaks and what we have witnessed becomes like a dream within a dream.|Fresh
"""Demon"" isn't afraid to be blunt. But bluntness isn't always a crime, and this is a case where a film tries to make a lack of subtlety work for it, not against it."|Fresh
Crackling, spookily atmospheric, intelligent, sometimes funny ghost story. It builds on family secrets to take on wider social and historical resonance for Poles and Jews.|Fresh
Demon ranks up there with The Witch and The Babadook as one of the best recent horror films.|Fresh
Wrona's film isn't about demonic possession so much as it a ghost story, a piece of shameful history that refuses to be buried (it is telling that the film opens with a tracking shot of a front loader making its way from an excavation site...|Fresh
It's comedy, as much as the eerie atmosphere and Tiran's very physical performance, that distinguishes Demon from routine ghost stories.|Fresh
"Perhaps it's best to appreciate ""Demon"" not for what it implies but for what it simply and unmistakably is: A bravura testament to a talent silenced far too soon."|Fresh
It's also so weighted down with mysticism and metaphor it forgets to quicken your pulse or whiten your knuckles.|Rotten
More interesting than the horror imagery is the film's painfully somber message-no matter how far we try to run, the sins of history surround us always.|Fresh
A comedy of errors similar to Death at a Funeral with the tense atmosphere of the unknown calling to mind The Shining for reasons both general and specific..|Fresh
Skillfully realized story of a dybbuk, a diabolical spirit from Jewish folklore who addresses wrongdoings.|Fresh
Cynics and pragmatists suggest that unknown factors surface after marriage. Demon, an often auspicious union of satire and horror, offers a variation.|Fresh
Nailing a tricky sense of physical anarchy (as well as some far subtler domestic tensions), Marcin Wrona's Polish import is an eerie, extraordinarily poised piece of horror.|Fresh
The film has a powerful undercurrent suggesting the feverish workings of a troubled yet brilliant mind.|Fresh
Whatever Demon's autobiographical elements, this film feels incredibly personal; like a howl of pain ripped straight out of someone's soul.|Fresh
Ambiguity is a worthy artistic goal, of course. But when Demon ends, the audience is left to sort through a thicket of dangling plot threads.|Rotten
"Things head eventually in an abstract direction that may have played better onstage than it does here (""we must forget what we didn't see here,"" guests are eventually instructed), but a compelling atmosphere lingers."|Fresh
"This subject matter is not unfamiliar, but Demon is imaginative in its approach, faultlessly modulated in execution, and hauntingly faithful to the original subtitle of Der Dibuk: ""Between Two Worlds."""|Fresh
Demon is a film that improves the longer it sits with you, as various images seep into your consciousness and reappear without warning.|Fresh
DEMON is a prodigious story, one that terrifies and resonates and remains.|Fresh
Demon is a smarter, more elegant brand of horror, one that wrestles with complicated, festering cultural conflicts that, in turn, advance the matters at hand.|Fresh
Once the wedding begins, director Wrona springs a dazzling variety of set pieces of exponentially intensifying strangeness and sadness.|Fresh
Marcin Wrona's Demon is spooky fun that unexpectedly mines the same collective guilt that powered Pawel Pawlikowski's brilliant historical drama Ida.|Fresh
I highly recommend it.|Fresh
Demon raises many questions, but supplies no easy answers. What it delivers, however, is one of the scariest, most sickeningly creepy horror films of the year.|Fresh
