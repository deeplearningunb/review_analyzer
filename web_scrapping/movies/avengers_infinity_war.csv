A huge, monumental feature that will at once please, torture, frustrate, and delight its dedicated fanbase|Fresh
This is the kind of film that comic book fans have spent their entire lives dreaming about, one that breathes life into events that heretofore could only have existed on the page, or in the imagination.|Fresh
The directors demonstrate how to juggle disparate segments while maintaining an emotional thread.|Fresh
One thing that positively separates Avengers: Infinity War from other MCU films is that our villain Thanos is a real threat...it truly felt like anything could happen.|Fresh
Infinity War is fun and does a nice job of mixing all the tones from these characters' other films. It's peak superhero entertainment.|Fresh
If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you will want to watch this movie with like-minded fans.|Fresh
I'm not the greatest fan when it comes to comic book movies but this one feels so epic and ambitious it's hard not to become engaged with its story. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
It's a mostly-thrilling roller coaster ride for Marvel fans, though I wouldn't say it's my favorite in the MCU canon. Some parts are overlong and some went by way too fast.|Fresh
If you're a MCU fan, watch it. If you're a comics fan, watch it. If you love action, watch it.|Fresh
It's still mostly a good movie with a lot of fun scenes. They do a good job balancing all the characters but I did not like the ending|Fresh

A triumph for Marvel, Disney and blockbuster filmmaking. By fusing the best parts of the 18 movies behind it, the sum is considerably greater.|Fresh
Infinity War highlights just how dude-centric the MCU has been for 10 years.|Rotten
Infinity War truly felt like a perfect culmination of the whole MCU [Marvel Cinematic Universe].|Fresh
Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have already demonstrated their ability to keep a lot of superhero plates spinning, but they take their talent to a whole new level here, somehow finding a moment for every character to shine.|Fresh
While the movie has all of the humor and wit that have become Marvel's trademark, this is also the darkest and most devastating onscreen offering they've ever given us.|Fresh
Personally, I think that most people will either like this movie or love it.|Fresh
It manages to give the audience a full gamut of emotions, from rage to heartbreak.|Fresh
In the end, the plot of the film was still the same familiar Marvel clichés, just shown from a new perspective.|Fresh
Wall-to-wall action, a well-developed lead villain, and some legitimately funny moments, as a celebration of 10 years of the MCU, this is a real blast.|Fresh
Infinity War works on a visual, narrative and emotional level.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War wasn't merely a film, it was an event-my usual cinema was jam-packed with eager fans, buzzing with excitement. The most astonishing moment of this entire experience was the weight of leaving the cinema in a heavy silence.|Fresh
We have such feels when we watch Infinity War because Marvel has earned our emotions. They built these characters, they developed our connection to them and we've seen them struggle with heroics to always come out on the right side.|Fresh
[Avengers: Infinity War] is a humongous film, just like its villain, and thoroughly enjoyable.|Fresh
The MCU has arrived at one hell of a climax.|Fresh
[It's] a gargantuan circus tent and functions roughly the same; maybe you don't like every act in the circus, but the ones that you do are worth the admission alone.|Fresh
Infinity War es la película más grande que Marvel Studios ha puesto a nuestro alcance, pero con casi veinte películas que le preceden, hay una pequeña sensación de que el MCU nos ha dado todo lo que tenía para ofrecer.|Fresh
If you take away only one thing from this review, make it this: you will not be disappointed with this movie.|Fresh
Filled with emotion, thrilling action, great character dynamics, dark themes, and an incredible ending, Avengers: Infinity War is simply one of the best Marvel films to date.|Fresh
Marvel's 10-year plan to get viewers invested in its flawlessly cast roster of geniuses, weirdos, misfits, and monsters has actually worked, finally paying some real emotional dividends.|Fresh
Now in their nineteenth endeavor, the Joe and Anthony Russo-directed Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel Studios demonstrates, not with a bang but with a whisper, that they are mighty.|Fresh
It seems every MCU film has been increasingly bolder; none are as trusting that audiences, wherever it goes, will follow as this is.|Fresh
The emotional stakes are raised in this exciting Marvel entry, which manages to balance all of its storylines remarkably well.|Fresh
But if you've been a fan of even a small handful of the previous Marvel films, there's little chance that you won't feel satisfied with this. And by 'satisfied', we mean shaken to the core.|Fresh
Infinity War is a worthy entry into the franchise and it encapsulates all the best aspects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe--which is mainly the character interactions.|Fresh
Infinity War manages to live up to an insane amount of hype. These characters are just so fun to watch together on screen that I hope it never ends.|Fresh
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" just has so many characters to deal with that it struggles to feel like anything truly special other than fluffy entertainment."|Fresh
Fantastic fun, though with so many superheroes jostling for position it's hard to delve deep even in 2.5 hours. There are plenty of jokes, some hilarious, some endearingly clunky. Brolin imbues Thanos with remarkable depth.|Fresh
For those who have been waiting for this culmination of Marvel's efforts for the past decade, Avengers: Infinity War will be a strong experience.|Fresh
The defining chapter in the next step of the world's biggest film series, Avengers: Infinity War has to be seen on the big screen in order to be truly appreciated.|Fresh
It's still incomplete and next year's follow-up may change everything, but at the moment, it appears Marvel's ambitious opus, ten years in the making, has been worth the build-up.|Fresh
Infinity Wars just doesn't have a lot of style to call its own|Fresh
Infinity War is not just trash, but it turns age-old questions of faith into trash -- and does it for fun. Maybe the best word for that is: pathetic.|Rotten
Audaciously epic and stirringly entertaining, it's a devastating, historic spectacle (emphasis on devastating).|Fresh
Infinity War is a very fun movie that rarely stops to take a breath.|Fresh
It is a monument to everything Marvel Studios has accomplished to this point whilst also eschewing many of the expectations and clichés it helped build about the genre.|Fresh
Short version: Very good, better than the second, not as good as the first, not as good as Guardians of The Galaxy 2 or Black Panther more recently.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War is like a Thanksgiving feast for Marvel fans. It's the characters we love in action together on a scale we've never seen before. But as a complete experience in and of itself, it just isn't.|Fresh
Infinity War is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination...but it comes off more as the crossover story arc you need instead of the one you really want|Fresh
The culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first 10 years will wreck you emotionally.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War is the most Marvel movie that Marvel has ever Marveled.|Fresh
...the pseudo-TV episode Infinity War just builds upon its 18 predecessors only to burn them all to the ground to make us Tune In Next Time.|Rotten
A spectacle that leaves the audience breathless.|Fresh
That the film holds together as well as it does, and provides some truly fan-destroying shocks along the way, is nothing short of miraculous.|Fresh
An overstuffed but ultimately satisfying chapter in the ever-expanding Marvel world.|Fresh
It's emotional, it's grim, it's fun and it's big - Avengers 4 has an awful lot to live up to, but for now, just bask in the excellence of Infinity War.|Fresh
The 19th film in Marvel's ongoing series is, by a wide stretch, its most challenging.|Fresh
The culmination of ten years of groundwork. A master plan unlike any other. Everything has led to this moment, and what a moment it ends up being.|Fresh
"Although burdened with enough scale that can minimize the meaning of ""scale,"" Infinity War rarely buckles when there are a million ways that it could. Now that's a marvelous show!"|Fresh
"Now does ""Infinity War"" have a plethora of CGI excess overload? You betcha. But does it uniquely blend the characters and fittingly award them proper screen time without becoming a convoluted mess? Yes."|Fresh
The emotions are high, everything has weight, and the action and laughs are nonstop.|Fresh
This imbued Infinity War with a heart that many of the other films lack. Perhaps most visible is the way in which parenthood and love comes roaring into the MCU.|Fresh
While Hindi viewers will be able to follow the vastness of the Marvel universe and enjoy the movie for the big ticket spectacle that it is, we wish the voice cast was kept constant in all the Avenger Hindi dubs.|Fresh
"This movie is definitely a ""Part 1,"" so final review is reserved for when Part 2 is over, BUT- so much good stuff! (Except the romance. Stop forcing it in, MCU.)"|Fresh
This movie is phenomenal, and it ends in such a poetically beautiful way.|Fresh
A tremendously satisfying piece of gargantuan blockbuster cinema that delivers as many shocks as it does thrills.|Fresh
[Marvel] pulls it off. This does feel like 10 years of storytelling and it feels like these are characters that you have watched go through things and watched them grow.|Fresh
It's very well paced, it's very well balanced in terms of how it deals with the cahracters, but man is it action-packed!|Fresh
It lived up to all the hype.|Fresh
Colorful, goofy, funky and with heart...best authentic comic book I've ever seen, with a payoff that's extraordinary.|Fresh
Infinity War didn't wear me down in the way that Age of Ultron did, it didn't give me the high of the first Avengers either. Like I said, manage expectations and you'll be just fine.|Fresh
There was only one choice to ensure the sheer logistics didn't leave [us] with nothing more than the chaotic flailing of explosions and one-liners: make Thanos the star.|Fresh
Infinity War tackles some big ideas and makes some brave choices that may cause you to reassess the entire Marvel franchise.|Fresh
You do feel the weight of a little too much going on, but at the end of the day, the movie never breaks under that. Easily the best villain the MCU has ever had.|Fresh
... Infinity War is an exhilarating and shocking ride.|Fresh
Epic.|Fresh
Given the monumental task that these filmmakers had they still managed to tell an entertaining story.|Fresh
The film's risk comes from the inherent need to 'balance' a myriad of characters' storylines, yet the story itself is nothing more than those same MCU building blocks.|Fresh
There is a sense of relief that one has that Avengers: Infinity War proved to be a really good movie that doesn't waste any of the goodwill built up over the past 10 years.|Fresh
Visually exhilarating, with moments of gasp-inducing turns, Infinity War is the great, almost operatic showdown fans have been anticipating with every new title.|Fresh
It's powerful, it's draining, it's fantastically harrowing.|Fresh
Whatever your opinion of Marvel and their box office domination, there is no denying that Infinity War is an endlessly entertaining that will leave some in a far more fragile emotional state than they perhaps expected.|Fresh
Possibly the greatest - and most ambitious - superhero movie to date.|Fresh
[Chris] Evans has stepped up from being a relatively unknown performer to establish himself as not only the heart, but the backbone of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.|Fresh
It's something you have to see to believe, and once you see it, you still won't believe it.|Fresh
"I suppose it's par for the course, for what is the Marvel Borg collective if not a celebration of uniformity? Excuse me for asking this comic book-based ""Emperor's New Clothes"" to aim higher."|Rotten
Avengers: Infinity War is like binge-watching a 22-episode TV series all in one sitting.|Fresh
The film is engaging, entertaining, and dark enough for me to get a kick out of the reveling evil on screen.|Fresh
What is surprising about Infinity War when you watch it a second time on VOD is how much of the film endures because of the character development across the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.|Fresh
With all of the noise, the explosions and the distractions, this ends up being a film about Thanos. And that's a good thing.|Fresh
[The directors and writers] have delivered an action-packed spectacle, filled with the great characters that the fans have come to know and love, ultimately resulting in a grand epic that is nothing short of compelling and entertaining.|Fresh
Less easily justified are a handful of crucially puzzling decisions made by several of the protagonists with regard to those Stones not yet in Thanos' grasp.|Fresh
Infinity War is an absolute achievement on a logistical level and as daring as any comic book movie has a right to be.|Fresh
There are too many characters in this movie for anyone to really summarize it in a cohesive manner.|Rotten
A misstep that sets up an overly predictable follow-up where repercussions are inconsequential.|Rotten
Despite the crowding and the abundance of story, the Russos offered up something that was relatively easy to follow, because all of the various strands of the story laid out over the last ten years were tossed aside for a simple and basic plot.|Fresh
When they cross the line into noncomic violence and torture with me, I'm done being amused.|Rotten
To a certain extent, the film manages to redeem the worst Marvel films that have been made in the last 10 years... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The missing heroes will appear and the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue to live, kicking and producing movies until the cash register stops ringing. This is the business.|Rotten
Death looms in every scene.|Fresh
The variety of the action, combined with the intense music score from Alan Silvestri, should keep you alert for the full duration.|Fresh
There's an overwhelming nature to the Marvel factory's narrative, but it manages to combine these characters and genres without losing a sense of adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The movie feels consequential and delivers emotional heft, not to mention laughs galore.|Fresh
This isn't film, this is manufacturing. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
"That feeling - the abruptness of the ending, the ""left in the lurch"" lack of satisfaction - is certainly the most bold and brazen risk-taking the MCU has dared try in the last decade."|Fresh
Amidst an ocean of strong performances is a movie that is exciting, exhilarating, tragic, hilariously funny at times, and deadly serious.|Fresh
Shockingly short on memorable images, with most scenes composed in the banal shot-reverse-shot coverage familiar from episodic television.|Rotten
Infinity War succeeds in sweeping you into a grand adventure and reminding you why you love these characters, but it doesn't solve the narrative problems that haunt Marvel.|Fresh
'Infinity War' isn't a life-altering experience that changes the language of film, but it is an ass-kicking popcorn superhero flick that delivers the spectacle fans have waited years for.|Fresh
If a movie can be defined by the strength of its villain, Avengers Infinity War is a giant. Towering over the spectacle is Josh Brolin's evil despot Thanos, whose striking capture motion performance and physicality comes close to stealing the film.|Fresh
A minor improvement over Avengers: Age of Ultron...|Rotten
[The Russos] have succeeded... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An impossibly coherent, soulful take on an entire galaxy's worth of superheroes.|Fresh
This is 'Avengers: Disassemble', a dark but deliberate film that, despite some flaws, is easily the best group flick that Marvel has yet produced.|Fresh
The directing duo of the Russo brothers have proven time and again that they are wonderful weavers of character interaction, and they use that as their glue to hold this massive cinematic attempt together.|Fresh
My goodness this is fun.|Fresh
As a longtime detester of the MCU machine, I must admit that it brought me some joy.|Rotten
Not only is it incomplete despite a running time of 149 minutes... but its action would be meaningless to anyone who hasn't seen a good many previous Marvel pictures.|Rotten
It's as good as can be with an overcrowded character stew.|Fresh
Everything that has been said about this film, perhaps this year's most anticipated movie, is true.|Fresh
In truth, Avengers: Infinity Wars works best as the first part of something much bigger... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The danger is real, the humor is spot on and the action is fantastic... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
For better or worse, Avengers: Infinity War is a blast.|Fresh
The rebel Goonie grows up and brings on the Apocalypse.|Fresh
Succeeds as a multi-layered, multi-character and emotionally resounding superhero opera.|Fresh
The story is energetic enough to sustain so many big characters. And the Russo brothers do a decent job juggling them all.|Fresh
There is plenty of time for huge superhero battles, though, and for the geek-out moments that fans will go crazy for.|Fresh
Too many characters, too much plot, too much everything|Rotten
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a thrilling, nearly overwhelming cinematic experience that serves as a satisfying culmination of all that's come before it."|Fresh
Like any culmination of a long-running series, there's purpose and emotion as this blockbuster intertwines its many strands, provides a gripping payoff and paves - as always - another path forward.|Fresh
This is a big film with big implications for the series, and for that it should be praised.|Fresh
Infinity War is entertaining and by no means a disappointment, but it's otherwise kind of empty.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War has trouble fitting in so many characters and giving them proper emotional moments as well as the fireworks in its 149 minute run time.|Rotten
Almost 20 movies in, maybe someone should have realized that it wasn't going to be possible to continue topping the previous installments.|Fresh
The conclusion of Infinity War is so shocking because it doesn't feel like a cliffhanger, more like a drastic wiping clean of the slate before the whole cycle starts again, with whatever reversal of fortune or comprehensive reboot it may be.|Fresh
The title of this movie should be 'Avengers: Infinity War Part One,' because that is what it is. It is not a movie that stands on its own. It is a leaning monolith that would fall flat without 'Part Two' to lean against.|Fresh
An exhausting barrel roll of a narrative, functioning less as a complete story and more as a frenetic series finale.|Fresh
While the MCU still hasn't gotten the formula quite right for true villainy, they have certainly mastered the equation for entertaining banter & epic superhero moments.|Fresh
This is why I find the movie's belief that it's doing something experimental and unprecedented more than uncomfortable: Infinity War gambles dangerously with the way people process real deaths, never mind fictional ones.|Rotten
For a movie with a ridiculously unwieldy cast, Infinity War is surprisingly comprehensible and fun.|Fresh
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is bold, bombastic, and likely to bum a lot of people out."|Fresh
It all amounts to heaps of superhero, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink, asinine spectacle.|Rotten
Avengers: Infinity War has taken all of the elements that have made past films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe work and given them a shot of steroids.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity Wars is clearly a superhero flick for everybody. At times this works, and at times its excessiveness works a little bit against itself.|Fresh
Infinity War is a sobering reminder that even the biggest, strongest communities sometimes face adversity that results in sacrifice, uncertainty, and loss.|Fresh
The movie deserves to be full of itself.|Fresh
How long are we going to have to start enduring jokes about -- or from -- the 80's? [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Wow! [Infinity War] has left me on quite a cliffhanger. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Aside from a few frames of Thanos laboring on his feelings, there is no other commentary other than the idea of sacrifice. {Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
A two-and-a-half-hour thrillride, with plenty of action, laughs and potential for tearing-up, directing duo Anthony and Joe Russo have done an amazing job of shoehorning Marvel's myriad of superheroes into a coherent tale.|Fresh
The action is clear, entertaining and sufficiently varied. It holds on the tension constantly and the sense of urgency is never gone. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A spectacular display of monotony.|Fresh
It is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems, apocalypse must now enter into it.|Rotten
Avengers: Infinity War begins to close the portal to Marvel Studios' three phases in an extravagant fashion, combining the star power of several successful franchises to create an enviable ensemble|Fresh
Joe and Anthony Russo's film is like an over-egged birthday cake, edible in patches but spoilt by too many competing ingredients.|Rotten
The film-making ambition is a joy to behold, the delivery impressive and, as for the spine-tingling ending, well it's close to genius.|Fresh
It's non stop, great fun and doesn't feel too long.|Fresh
It may still move at hectic speed from one gargantuan punch-up to the next, but - under the direction of Joe and Anthony Russo - it's well paced for the sort of extravaganza it is. The all-star parade never becomes a pile-up.|Fresh
Faced with such brilliant results, there is no alternative but to look forward to how the story will continue... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A bloated-yet-breezy blockbuster.|Fresh
All-in-all, Avengers: Infinity War is a pretty big success. It's rather incredible that these guys were able to cram so much into one epic-sized film and have it turn out this well.|Fresh
For fans, this is the pay-off you've been waiting for, which is saying something. It's the most epic MCU film to date.|Fresh
The major concession is that the film's organic structure and its resistance to showcase one indestructible character adds much-needed spontaneity to Marvel Studios' ageing formula.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War is more than just a great superhero movie. The emotional impact on the audience, the artistry, and the brilliant storytelling are so astonishingly good, that it is simply a great film. Period.|Fresh
The movie equivalent of a theme park ride. Has highs, lows, excitement and an ending to make sure you wanna go on it again... after you've regained your breath. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This chaotic but surprisingly nimble instalment, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, brings together an eye-popping ensemble cast of A-listers (imagine the table read!) and pushes them into playful new configurations.|Fresh
Thanos is given tremendous emotional depth and development but the rest of the vast superhero pantheon appear to have been given two hours of busy work.|Fresh
... witnessing the selfless struggle of it all unfolding has both the necessary epic feel of a summer blockbuster infused with all the heart fans have come to expect from Marvel - 'nuff said.|Fresh
One has to treat the culmination of 10 years of Marvel movies as a season finale, or at least the first part of a season finale. It's not really a movie in its own right.|Fresh
If some pacing issues and the occasional bloat prevent it from quite reaching the upper echelons of the MCU, there's still more than enough here to keep viewers sated, saturated, and salivating over what's certain to be a poignant and potent Part Deux.|Fresh
Feels more like several movies squished together like a cinematic panini. Still, it's easy to be swept along by Banner's Hulkus Interruptus condition that frustrates him mightily.|Fresh
Nothing is solved as fighters on both sides die and that's the end of the story. ...So what's left?|Rotten
While this is a massive comic-book spectacle, what's most amazing is how - after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996 - Marvel, led by Kevin Feige, now dominates the global box-office.|Fresh
It is a massive spectacle full of fun character moments, impressive action sequences and a real sense of stakes.|Fresh
This is an epic tale sheathed in spandex, a super heroic soap opera. The Russos know how to deliver the bang, but also when to lay back.|Fresh
"The film plays like an ""event book"" reads"|Fresh
It's fine, but you wonder how they can expect you to care about an earth-shattering conclusion when the previous two hours (and 18 movies) were all about these magic stones that can undo anything.|Fresh
This blockbuster leaves you wildly curious about the sequel, even if you are not an Avengers fanatic.|Fresh
Has twists that keep you hooked and make you gasp. The MCU will never be the same again.|Fresh
As it is, everything feels like a bait and switch.|Rotten
Avengers: Infinity War isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be.|Fresh
This is probably the best, if not second best, movie in the MCU...this movie makes some bold, heavy choices.|Fresh
My default feeling throughout was numbness bordering on fatigue.|Rotten
Thanks to Thanos, Infinity War is much more than a two-part blockbuster, and for the first time in a long time, we can't easily anticipate more of the same, because the road ahead for superheroes is murky, complicated, and terrifying.|Fresh
This is a wildly entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions.|Fresh
Enjoyable but empty, Avengers: Infinity War embodies the humdrum side of the MCU.|Rotten
It's freakishly big. It encompasses dozens of characters. It has a million moving parts. So the good news about Avengers is that this culmination of a 10-year story loop is relatively coherent.|Fresh
All-all-all, Infinity War is a film that surpasses most superhero films in terms of vision, scale, grandeur and execution.|Fresh
"Too long, too dark, too confusing - and it should state up front it is part one of a ""to be continued"" movie. The humor helps you endure the overrunning length."|Rotten
How does art land in the world? Genre filmmaking at its best provides topical spark, often beyond the will of its creators.|Fresh
Everyone shows up in this film, there is not a single weak performance to speak of.|Fresh
As expected, Avengers: Infinity War has one of the most sensational and complicated group of action scenes in the MCU so far. This is, after all, the big fight.|Fresh
But that all goes to show that Infinity War is the kind of film that reels you in and you become emotionally invested. I'll definitely be watching again.|Fresh
Clocking in at more than two-and-a-half hours, Infinity War never drags. Having multiple characters and storylines to cut back and forth between helps build a sense of pace.|Fresh
The Russo Brothers have confectioned a film whose frenetic pacing can fatigue Marvel skeptics, but will cause joyous anxiety for loyal fans. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War is relentless action and entertainment, packed with super-heroes, super-heroines, superpowers and a super cliffhanger.|Fresh
This is a movie for hardcore fans... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
After seeing Infinity War, I wasn't sure if I'd see it again but after thinking about it a bit longer, I do feel I could get more out of a second viewing.|Fresh
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a super movie - gigantic, but with an undeniable, powerful, humanity."|Fresh
Infinity War is a treat, and a welcome addition to the now-decade-old Avengers series. Already, we can't wait for the next one.|Fresh
Infinity War is an achievement unparalleled in movie history, the culmination of 10 years, 19 movies and comic book stories going back to 1941 when Captain America was originally created by Jack Kirby.|Fresh
[Infinity War] delivers on its promises without exceeding itself and also drops various surprises to various characters that we have seen grow throughout the last decade. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Despite its weak book end, ""Infinity War"" is a great adaptation and stellar crossover..."|Fresh
Although I know that I disliked Avengers: Infinity War long before it arrived at its long-overdue climax, that sequence is the part that I disliked the most.|Rotten
It's an infinity all right. The definition of overkill.|Rotten
So much happens, getting bored is physically impossible. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Our superheroes are on the tightrope, but in the end, they are a group of extraordinary people who will fight the battle that we cannot fight. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This jumping backwards and forwards from too many plot threads sometimes dissipates the tension and over-complicates everything. Fortunately, the contractually-impossible cast is mostly in strong form.|Fresh
It's ironic that one of Marvel's darkest films is also one of its most fun, with the character banter and personality clashes that have made so many Marvel movies memorable in full abundance.|Fresh
Whether the wit fizzes or flops, a Marvel movie will always live or die by its action set-pieces. And in this latest adventure, they are truly spectacular...|Fresh
For a movie with dozens of superheroes battling in half a dozen war-torn worlds, Marvel's penultimate epic is remarkably orderly.|Fresh
Intense violence, strong messages in shocking Marvel epic.|Fresh
On the surface Avengers: Infinity War feels like the usual winning formula. But as the film unfolds you realise it is a monumental undertaking, gradually emerging as the War And Peace of superhero movies.|Fresh
Slightly above average for an MCU movie, though more of a triumph of continuity than of entertainment or filmmaking.|Fresh
There's just too much of this thing.|Fresh
What prevents Avengers: Infinity War from being as entertaining as some of its predecessors is that there aren't many small moments that make the explosions and CGI monsters more meaningful.|Fresh
Infinity War feels about as emotionally empty as a child slamming action figures together.|Rotten
Thanos is an idiot, but neither he nor the filmmakers know this.|Rotten
Avengers: Infinity War is almost unwieldy, but as always, the strength of this deep cast and their ability to balance serious stakes and snarky humor gets it right.|Fresh
It lifts, inspires and stings in a raw way that studio blockbusters rarely manage.|Fresh
Given that the plot motor is Thanos's worry that the universe is overpopulated, sly self-awareness is shown as the filmmakers embrace drastic solutions to the problems of braiding multiple franchises into one.|Fresh
An impressive feat simply because of the discipline and skill required to deliver so much in such a comparatively tight package.|Fresh
The movie is packed with fun banter and set pieces, but it's not really about anything, and the ending falls flat.|Rotten
Infinity War gets by with a witty first hour and the starry appeal of the cast, but the gears really grind near the finish.|Rotten
Fans will likely find Infinity War satisfactory. As narrative filmmaking, however, it's a disaster: a bloated monstrosity that smothers to death its most intriguing aspects.|Rotten
All I know is that Marvel has lived up to its reputation for daring its filmmakers to break boundaries, and trusting its audience to go along for the ride. I don't think fans will be disappointed.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War is everything you wanted and more - it's the end of the beginning of the end, an ambitious spectacle that confidently juggles character moments between the most epic action Marvel has ever attempted.|Fresh
Thankfully, this $300 million entry into the Marvel comic-book movie universe is one of the better films pumped out by Marvel Studios and certainly makes up for the tornado of dung that was Avengers: Age of Ultron.|Fresh
A totally different beast: darker, riskier, and more brutal. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A disenchanting rain of colors that spans 150 minutes that will continue for years to come. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Ten years of Marvel superheroism culminates in a battle for the universe itself. Exhausting, bitterly humorous, and gripped in a stunning finality, it's almost too much to take in, yet somehow not enough.|Fresh
The outcome satisfyingly tops the trip and resonates long after you leave the theater. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Because so much is purposefully unresolved and so little is actually decided, I just can't say I enjoyed watching Infinity War all that much.|Rotten
I had a lot of fun with the action and amusing banter and did not mind being inundated with CGI or the 2+ hour run time.|Fresh
While these films have been flooding the market, you've got to hand it to uber-producer Kevin Feige whose grand design comes into sharper and sharper focus.|Fresh
If you thought Marvel was flagging after ten years of relentless action, Infinity War Part 1 suggests they haven't even got started.|Fresh
It's a rollercoaster ride that leaves you breathless, invested and eventually panting for more. Marvel's Cinematic Universe really is something to savour and hold up as special.|Fresh
It's a long but slight, expansive but restricted, and busy but straightforward contradiction of a movie.|Rotten
The fact is that in Infinity War... everyone has their moment and meshes perfectly with the whole. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's stunning to realize that their attempts to do so are the most emotionally affecting things in the whole of the perfectly-named Infinity War: people valiantly, desperately trying to evoke humanity in the midst of a machine that makes that impossible.|Rotten
The Russos, while tipping their hat to these individual filmmakers who put their unique stamp on each of their own films, elevate their own art and skilfully weave a story that seems cohesive and resonant, physically and emotionally.|Fresh
The equivalent of a bad one-night stand with a very weak climax that you wish would've ended much, much sooner.|Rotten
But on the whole, Infinity War is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that pits all of the good guys against the ultimate big bad for all of the marbles in the universe.|Fresh
Over the last decade, the Marvel movies have shown us they can be more - weirder, funnier, more eccentric, even more politically loaded than simple adventure stories. This one feels like a step backward.|Rotten
Expect to be mightily entertained by this offering that expertly mixes action and comedy before segueing into something that sort of reaches for Shakespearean levels. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
The [Russo] brothers clearly know what clicks and to keep things moving.|Fresh
By the time Infinity War draws to its enigmatic whopper of a close, even viewers feeling burned out by the guys-in-long-underwear genre will find themselves eager for the sequel. Is it next summer yet?|Fresh
Yes, I want to see the next Marvel movie. But I long for popcorn movies like the last couple of Mission: Impossible installments, in which, after two-plus hours of ridiculously entertaining action, the mission actually is accomplished.|Fresh
This is a movie that needs the other 18 to exist before it. Otherwise, we'd know very little about these characters, their concerns, and why we should care for them.|Fresh
If Infinity War were the Second World War, I'd go all Churchill and declare that this is not even the beginning of the end. But it is definitely the end of the beginning.|Fresh
'Epic' doesn't even begin to describe this mind-exploding spectacle.|Fresh
Infinity War is, in short, an astonishing and impossible achievement.|Fresh
It's the sense that everything has been building to this moment and now, as the fun truly begins, there's nothing left to do but sit back and revel in the spectacle of it all.|Fresh
There's a lot to meditate on in this breathlessly told comic book adventure film.|Fresh
A film that's overlong and overstuffed but somehow avoids being a chore to watch.|Fresh
There's a lot going on in Infinity War, including actual suffering, sacrifice and real emotions, most of which won't sink in until the end credits roll.|Fresh
...as much a fantastic amusement park ride as a cinematic experience, with an engaging cast doing an incredible job of not getting lost in the proceedings.|Fresh
Intriguing, but virtually devoid of suspense. Funny, but pressing too hard for laughs. Monotonous, but not boring...Still, the ambitious Infinity War should be mandatory viewing for serious Marvel movie fans.|Fresh
There is whip-smart warfront humor to lighten the mood but, most importantly, in bleak times on and off the screen, they give us something vital: hope.|Fresh
Infinity War's place in the Avengers saga is much like that of the middle chapters in the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars: It's chief purpose is to leave you hungry for next summer's finale. And that much, it does.|Fresh
"After uneven start, ""Infinity War"" finishes with a bang."|Fresh
"For Marvel fans preparing to see the grim, thrilling ""Avengers: Infinity War"" for the first time, only one piece of advice will do: brace yourselves."|Fresh

You know all that Infinity War hype? It lives up to it. And then some.|Fresh
Relentless, entertaining and more than a touch surprising, yet starved of substance and likely to leave many feeling shortchanged.|Fresh
It's crowded, busy and noisy--and if you're a Marvel fan, pretty close to heaven.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War does the impossible. It tops all previous 19 Marvel movies while continuing to redefine the action genre.|Fresh
For all the blockbuster spectacle on display, the film ends up in a place that's unexpectedly poetic and poignant, proving that even a movie of this size still has the ability to surprise - and more to the point: tell a good story.|Fresh
For those less schooled in all the backstories, Infinity War scatterguns enough laughs, thrilling digital effects and exhilarating chaos to compensate for any confusion.|Fresh
After 2.5 hours of watching superheroes battle dark forces, I'm exhausted. And elated.|Fresh
There are some decent laughs before things turn serious, and the deft timing that has always been one of the sneakier pleasures of this multi-chapter behemoth is in evidence as heroes collide in attitude and physique.|Fresh
Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else.|Rotten
Equal parts exciting and exhausting, the film's resonant emotional crux and solid supervillain are unfortunately outweighed by an overwhelming amount of ambition and scope.|Fresh
Infinity War is a dark and satisfying superhero flick, full of death, if you're into that sort of thing.|Fresh
"Hail, hail --- the gang's all here! ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is totally thrilling, hilarious and vastly entertaining!"|Fresh
The reported budget of about $300 million should, in all likelihood, look like a bargain when the final returns are tallied.|Fresh
The scope of the movie is massive. Yet, it feels intimate because, through the previous Marvel movies, we have become emotionally invested in many of these characters.|Fresh
Infinity War certainly isn't totally perfect, but it's a damn fun time that rises to its challenge.|Fresh
"""Infinity War"" isn't concerned with endings, but as set-ups go, it's a humdinger, going apocalyptic while still retaining familiar beats of humor, heart, and body-smashing confrontations."|Fresh
In some sense, this is every Marvel movie combined. So if the first installment of the two-part culmination of all that effort seems a bit loaded, I'd say other critics need to put their nitpicky hats away. This is for the fans, and they have earned it.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War changes everything... maybe.|Rotten
Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, in places both old and new, we get to witness some of the most beautiful and awe inspiring images the directors (and the entire MCU) have delivered to date.|Fresh
It's intended to knock your socks off and, in the end, it finally attains a stirring, if slightly morose, grandeur.|Fresh
The final moments of Infinity War are haunting and impactful and mysterious.|Fresh
...a business play forcing us to make yet another down payment on our collective Marvel mortgage.|Rotten
Be prepared to sweat, cry, and clench your armrest because Avengers: Infinity War is one hell of a ride.|Fresh
If the Marvel Cinematic Universe aims to reshape popular entertainment, it needs to move beyond climax after climax with unremarkable, repetitive violence.|Rotten
Watching Infinity War is like riding the most exhausting Six Flags roller coaster in existence three times consecutively|Fresh
It's a little unwieldy, there are slow patches and the odd misstep, there are so many characters that your favourite might feel hard done by, and it is definitely Part 1... but the fact is that Infinity War is pretty damn thrilling.|Fresh
The flavors of this multi-movie sundae blend beautifully.|Fresh
Marvel betrays the richness of its comic books in pursuit of the bedazzlement of the modern blockbuster movie; leaving us undernourished but entertained.|Rotten
If you've felt we're nearing superhero exhaustion, Marvel just went and changed the rules leaving you begging for more - proving yet again that they are the real masters of this game.|Fresh
Somehow nearly every story that's been started in this cinematic universe gets serviced. That's no small feat for a series that centers on more than a dozen different characters, and yet still manages to make every one of them count.|Fresh
This movie almost, but not quite seamlessly, brings together the disparate strands of a decade's worth of Marvel/Disney movies.|Fresh
This is Marvel doing the absolute best version of the formula it's been criticised for overusing. They've blown it right up and now need to throw out that formula for good.|Fresh
It's not exactly a crowded mess, but a tricky ending to this mad, mad, mad universe -- complete with all the requisite players -- will keep 'em coming back for more.|Rotten
A celebration of mediocrity on a scale the cinema has never seen before. Avengers: Infinity War isn't a movie: it's advertising and brand management|Rotten
"Ten years ago this month, the Marvel universe was launched with the fresh, lively, relatively easygoing ""Iron Man."" It seems more like 100."|Rotten
"Maybe ""Deadpool 2"" will be better..."|Rotten
Never boring, visually impressive, but ultimately rather depressing and unsatisfying, Infinity War will leave you wanting more. But not necessarily in the best way.|Rotten
"It took us 19 movies over a span of 11 years to finally reach this destination. The end result? ""Infinity War"" is just too much of everything."|Rotten
It's too much. Too many characters, too much action, too much everything. It's a superhero surplus with too many heroes and not enough screen. It's Infinity overload.|Rotten
Sitting through its 2 hours and 30 minutes is like gorging on tapas: You wind up both overstuffed and unsatisfied.|Rotten
Even by Marvel's own standards of serviceable mediocrity, Infinity War fails.|Rotten
Not even the threat of universal annihilation, it seems, will keep this assembly line from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency.|Rotten
There's no pacing in Avengers: Infinity War. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time.|Rotten
Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War -- an overstuffed sausage of summer entertainment -- is the Ocean's Thirteen of spandexed heroism, if you can imagine a version of that movie with two times as many Brad Pitts and no poker dealers.|Rotten
The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination.|Rotten
Throughout the film, rapidity of dialogue and drama is mistaken for actual rhythm, of which directors Anthony and Joe Russo have one mode: pedal-to-the-metal pandemonium.|Rotten
Love or loathe the genre, when I see a film this ambitious actually hitting its targets AND managing to stay human and accessible, I can't help but be extraordinarily impressed.|Fresh
The best Marvel film ever-the most complete, the most emotional, and the most thrilling.|Fresh
An adrenaline rush of a film laced with bombastic action, thrilling setpieces and a level of satisfaction that's the cumulation of a decade-long journey.|Fresh
"Only now could the MCU arrive at a place where bluffs can be irrefutably called and gauntlets, real or metaphorical, can be thrown down. With audacity and thoughtfulness, ""Infinity War"" upends the comparative breeziness of all that came before it."|Fresh
It's effective at being all the things it needs to be, even if that necessity is the thing that holds it back the most.|Fresh
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is almost three hours of non-stop action on multiple battlefields leading to a conclusion that will forever change the Marvel cinematic universe."|Fresh
This movie isn't actually about the Avengers. It's about Thanos.|Fresh
There is a fissure between critics and audiences, which I can admit. The movie is critic-proof. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is superhero porn, strictly for the fans, while 'Black Panther' was undeniably excellent, transcending the comic book fan base.|Fresh
Infinity War is so gargantuan in scope, it almost becomes too much to digest. The smaller moments that have made the Marvel Cinematic Universe so enjoyable are lost in the spectacle.|Fresh
The high doesn't last, but it's dizzying all the same.|Fresh
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR is nearly spread too thin by its massive amount of plot and characters. It redeems itself by being full of surprises and foreboding; focusing on the heroes' relationships and real peril in fierce, unrestrained action.|Fresh
Expectations surpassed. An ambitious, exhilarating and deeply satisfying culmination to a decade of great Marvel films. Thanos now reigns as the best villain of the MCU. Period. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It somehow meets every single impossible expectation you have for it. To be fair, it's only because you're stupid.|Fresh
Epic in scope and a stunning achievement in blockbuster cinema, Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War is a thrilling superhero extravaganza that will make you laugh, gasp and cry.|Fresh
The stakes have never been higher with the release of Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War.|Fresh
I'm breaking my rating scale for this one as this is the kind of crazy ambitious film that should be impossible to make this captivating, spectacular and memorable.|Fresh
It is a bold undertaking, to readjust what is expected of the MCU/Avengers formula, and there are moments when the sheer scale and momentum match the narrative ambition|Fresh
Easily the best Marvel movie ever made, this is also shaping up to be one of the great blockbusters of the 21st-century.|Fresh
Ten years of Marvel movies all culminate in  Avengers: Infinity War. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no.|Fresh
The exorbitant action scenes hit all the necessary crowd-pleasing buttons at regular intervals, but for a movie with infinite potential...it's possible to feel they banked on a rather narrow algorithm.|Fresh
Be sure to stick around, empty popcorn bag in hand, for the post-credits scene, which left me wanting another sequel. Preferably tomorrow.|Fresh
At times it feels like the Fellowship of the Infinity Stones.|Fresh
...an epic romp across the breadth if the Marvel Cinematic Universe with all the action, comedy, pageantry, and sturm und drangyou could hope for.|Fresh
... Unafraid, even eager to take the story and characters in dark, surprising new directions.|Fresh
Trust me -- if you've enjoyed any aspect of the last 10 years in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Infinity War will have something for you, and a lot of that is down to how it manages its stable of superheroes.|Fresh
It should never have been this good.|Fresh
The Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest entry is its biggest, most ambitious piece of storytelling in the studio's 10 years of existence and the minute you exit the theatre, you'll be lining up at the box office to buy another ticket. It's that good.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War succeeds in eliciting the emotional responses that Marvel has worked on building up over the last ten years.|Fresh
A deeply satisfying tale of pathos and wit that manages to credibly link dozens of characters, multiple narrative threads and innumerable arguments, stretching from the first Iron Man a decade ago to Black Panther mere weeks ago.|Fresh
Just when it looks as if all hope is smothered under the heavy weight of fan expectations [and] a reported $300 million budget, it comes roaring to life with a wake-'em-up battle on the fields of Wakanda and a quietly spectacular, sobering ending.|Fresh
Buckle up, folks, because this is the movie Marvel has been building toward for a decade, and it's astonishing.|Fresh
A culmination without being a finale, Avengers: Infinity War is an impressive achievement in blockbuster movie-making. But there's no denying that, expectation-wise, the MCU is starting to look a little bit like a victim of its own success.|Fresh
This movie completely, utterly, belongs to Josh Brolin's warmongering villain Thanos.|Fresh
"Marvel has set an amazing stage for Avengers: Infinity War, and my only real question walking into the theater was, ""How can they possibly bring all of this together in a way that works as an actual movie?"" You'll be shocked how well they pull it off."|Fresh
All the past decade's Marvel movies have been heading toward this showdown. Turns out the payoff was worth the wait.|Fresh
If only the film were better modulated, or perhaps longer, or more elegantly shaped, or ... well, it's hard to say exactly what's wrong here.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War delivers an exciting culmination of the MCU, though it's overstuffed and suffers from certain typical Marvel movie problems.|Fresh
[T]he most ambitious, most audacious, most mindblowing superhero film ever produced... THIS is why the superhero genre exists.|Fresh
This is a knockout sci-fi movie that travels around the universe and back, and not only does it capture the vastness of that but it's also perhaps the most beautiful, colorful film Marvel has released to date.|Fresh
In a cinematic world stuffed with big-budget movies, Infinity War is a genuine blockbuster.|Fresh
A wildly ambitious and incredibly successful exercise in long-form cinematic storytelling.|Fresh
Part of what makes Infinity War thrilling is the way it weaves its various narrative strands into a seamless whole-or, at least, as close to seamless as one might reasonably hope.|Fresh
After 10 years of lean, threadbare, Lilliputian tales, Marvel Studios has, thank heavens, finally decided to go big.|Fresh
The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs (those roguish Guardians!) that won't quit.|Fresh
"""Infinity War"" is big, blustery and brave, taking viewers to places that they may not be used to going."|Fresh
Thanos as an overall villain is menacing, powerful and with a purpose. He believes his mission is the right mission, no matter how heinous it may be.|Fresh
This is definitely a fun movie. But it doesn't make for a great movie.|Fresh
It's overlong, overcrowded and over here. But it gives everyone a go on the tricycle and propels each to dramatic (if not exactly fresh) catastrophes.|Fresh
Infinity War is a wildly ambitious and entertaining ride in which good old fashioned team work just about carries the day.|Fresh
Here, the special-ness comes from the pleasure of seeing all these larger-than-life personalities smashed together into one supersized adventure.|Fresh
It's not perfect, but it goes to a place most tentpole movies wouldn't dream of, while retaining the scale, excitement, and humour you've come to demand from an MCU movie.|Fresh
I fell short of loving this movie, but I liked it a lot...the humor to me was the highlight of the movie.|Fresh
Marvel has solved their third-act problem and villain problem and then some. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. But then, neither are our heroes.|Fresh
The Russo brothers are the true superpower of the Marvel universe. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The cliffhanger climax of Infinity War left the audience at my screening in a state that I can only describe with the most tired of critical clichés: They were stunned.|Fresh
Even as the movie forces audiences to submit to so many cataclysmic events, the directors manage to direct the cascading mayhem to a unique kind of cliffhanger.|Fresh
The one over-riding joy that continually propels Infinity War to better things stems from watching the movie come alive as so many disparate elements react to one another.|Fresh
What lies beyond it, I'm sure we'll know soon enough. For now, I'm enjoying Marvel's version of denouement-excessive and inevitable.|Fresh
You shouldn't be able to care about that many people at once. And yet, Avengers: Infinity War more than pulls it off.|Fresh
Infinity War, by design, feels like one half of a completed puzzle, with the other pieces strewn about waiting to be put together.|Fresh
Welcome to the ultimate superhero extravaganza.|Fresh
If you've been solidly along for the Marvel ride up to this point, you'll enjoy this leg of the journey even if it hasn't yet reached the terminal.|Fresh
Overall, however, Infinity War lands the vast majority of the emotional beats it's reaching for, which is why we're here anyway.|Fresh
Making good on Nick Fury's promise from 10 years ago, Infinity War is fun, thrilling, and emotional.|Fresh
You're gonna want to watch the next one the second this one ends. The final minutes proves just how good Marvel has been at building this universe over the past decade. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
An exhilarating and heart-aching cinematic event.|Fresh
A movie that mostly gets it right - and isn't afraid to go for truly dramatic moments, or remind us that even superheroes can be mortal.|Fresh
The It's a Mad,Mad,Mad,Mad World of superhero movies It happens to be both an all-star cast and an all-star roster of superheroes,since the superheroes are what made most of the actors A-list stars.We get to see all these stars put on a big show for us.|Fresh
Marvel has pulled off all sorts of cinematic flavors in its 10-year legacy, from heist films and political thrillers to space operas and fantasy epics. Now it boasts a full-fledged Shakespearean tragedy.|Fresh
What saves Infinity War from being just another bloated supergroup tour - and what will end up being the thing that blows fans' minds to dust - is the film's final stretch.|Fresh
The action is great and there is much good humor, but this is clearly the appetizer for next year's big finish.|Fresh
It's a unique, exceptional achievement that somehow leaves you both fully satisfied and desperate for more.|Fresh
This story may be on its last legs, but as table-setting for an even bigger threat, Infinity War daringly leaves more questions in the air. The way this world ends looks to be not with a bang, but a whimper.|Fresh
It's just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology. And confident also in the note of apocalyptic darkness. I know it's silly. And yet I can't help looking forward to the next supersized episode of mayhem.|Fresh
"What ""Infinity War"" accomplishes, with surprising ease, is complete immersion in this elaborate world, reflecting how deft Marvel has been in assembling it."|Fresh
"Avengers: Infinity War cares a bit too much about being ""Part 1"" and holding enough development for ""Part 2,"" but MCU fans should see their 10-year buildup expectations met - not exceeded, but met."|Fresh
For the first time in a while, I can't wait to see what happens next.|Fresh
It pays off the emotional investment movie audiences have been making in these characters for years, sometimes in genuinely heart-wrenching ways.|Fresh
This isn't just the biggest superhero movie ever, this is the biggest movie of all time...From the get-go you're thrown right in with no time to waste and not a second is - the two and half hours fly by.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War just might be the dorkiest movie ever made.|Fresh
Marvel's triumph is not that we are loyal audiences, not even loyal fans. We are slaves.|Fresh
This is, ultimately, a jaw-dropping game-changer.|Fresh
A textbook team-up movie.|Fresh
A superhero-space-opera that will knock you off your feet and quite possibly bring a lump to your throat.|Fresh
"If, for decades, the metaphor for propulsive blockbuster filmmaking was the ""ride,"" then watching ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is like going to a theme park and taking three spins on every ride there."|Fresh
If you're a fan of these characters and you're invested in their fates, there are plenty of thrills. But you better be really invested.|Fresh
I've been writing about Infinity War for the better part of a year, but I was not prepared for what it had in store. I stared at it slack-jawed for the last ten minutes, astonished at the places where Marvel took this film.|Fresh
With so many ingredients to stir into this overflowing pot, you have to hand it to the two experienced teams of Marvel collaborators who had a feel for how to pull this magnum opus off.|Fresh
The symbiosis of good versus evil is the pillar of its existence and measures up to a deeply felt extravaganza for the superhero senses. In many aspects, this is a remarkable film and the best that the MCU has offered yet.|Fresh
Rewarding and audacious in ways the franchise has never been before and isn't likely to be again. It's a movie that is not screwing around.|Fresh
L'apothéose de 10 ans de Marvel Cinematic Universe - ou du moins, la première partie. [Full review in French]|Fresh
After 10 years of investment in this series and these characters, boy does Infinity War knock the wind out of you. Humor, sky high stakes and a truly overwhelming amount of emotion.|Fresh
Marvel lays it all on the table for their latest super nova'd blockbuster Avengers Infinity War and then ruthlessly wipes it off clean.|Fresh
There's just too much of it. A victim of its own success, there are just too many appealing characters here to stuff into one story.|Rotten
Infinity War contains just about everybody...as if the sheer volume of Marvel characters would give the movie dramatic force. The opposite occurs.|Rotten
Overstuffed but underwhelming, 'Infinity War' is burdened with too many characters, too many battles, and an ending that is meant to shock but is obviously a cheap trick.|Rotten
Stunning action sequences, especially the climactic battle that rivals the immense Battle of Helms Deep in The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers.|Fresh
The mood shifts from one-liners to kitchen sink drama to downright bleak throughout, without ever jarring greatly. Surprise is the Russo's main weapon here. We never know what's coming next.|Fresh
[Chris] Pratt jumps from blustery to goofy to vulnerable to insecure to funny with ease, as he trades barbs with Thor and his own sidekicks. Dude has charisma to spare.|Fresh
"""Infinity War"" isn't just a proper sequel to that film; it's also the towering peak all these Marvel movies have been building to."|Fresh
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a successful tuneup for a tumultuous, significant chapter in the continuing Marvel Cinematic Universe that will alter the trajectory of the franchise as it enters its second decade."|Fresh
"Thanos packs a heck of a punch in ""Infinity War"" - he pretty much punches everyone. It's the emotion behind those punches that will surprise you."|Fresh
Some characters were used well, others were in support, and then some were just there because the contract said so...there's a lot happening, a lot of jumping around...but a decade of set up for an epic buildup I personally loved.|Fresh
Infinity War is going to please most people. It has some very shocking elements and a few disappointing elements...but this is a blast of a Marvel movie.|Fresh
[Spoiler-free review:] Marvel's superhero movies may not run the risk of being called 'elegant,' but they're sure as hell sturdy, well-built popcorn flicks that send audiences out unequivocally satisfied.|Fresh
It's true that darkness permeates Avengers: Infinity War, but it's also a masterfully crafted popcorn movie.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War is epic in a way that has been often aspired to but never fully grasped when it comes to the translation from comic book panel to the Big Screen.|Fresh
It's the epitome of a summer blockbuster. The explosive action is practically nonstop, breaking only occasionally for jokes and a touch of romance - though without ever breaking its grim, apocalyptic tone.|Fresh
A glorious, shocking, edge-of-the-seat adventure that boasts one of Marvel's best-ever villains ... perfectly played by Brolin and mesmerising from the first frame until the last.|Fresh
For critics who have spent much of the 21st century sniffing at the rise of the Marvel Comics Universe, it is probably time to admit that when the films are this good, they deserve every last beaming member of their audience.|Fresh
Avengers: Infinity War knows what it wants to be and goes about pursuing that goal with relentless intensity.|Fresh
What's on screen now, however, is table-setting for events to come, a groaning board of superheroes, a superabundance of undifferentiated superpowers, and an ending that's more exciting than anything that precedes it.|Fresh
The commotion of an ending will leave the public anxious for the next chapter, but Infinity War does tell a whole story by itself. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film ten years in the making whose only obstacle is its own success.|Fresh
Infinity War jumps from one incredible sequence to the next with dazzling ease and speed. Each leap brings a new level of entertainment and intensifies the emotional core of the story. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
