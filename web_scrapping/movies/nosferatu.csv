The movie's best effect is its star...He looks every bit like an actual demonic wild-thing, retrieved from deep within the German wilderness and trotted out to perform for Murnau's camera.|Fresh
...Nosferatu is a masterpiece of silent cinema that includes some of the creepiest images ever recorded on film.|Fresh
Still one of the scariest, most unnerving films ever made.|Fresh
There is pure expressionist inspiration in Murnau's juxtaposition of the malign wolves and the terrified old women: a poetry of fear.|Fresh
Count Orlock, played by the hideous Max Schreck, creeps through Murnau's archetypal silent imagery with a mesmerising authority that retains a surprising amount of tension.|Fresh
'Nosferatu' is worthwhile on two counts: mise-en-scne and the actor who is the title (and sole) vampire.|Fresh
Most likely the first horror film to express something beyond simple chills and thrills.|Fresh
Contains some truly iconic moments, but too much of it, i.e. any scene without Orlock, is less than stellar.|Fresh
His body is twisted and perverted, gnarling in on itself and constantly invading the personal space of the people around him.|Fresh
A landmark motion picture.|Fresh

Murnau proved his directorial artistry in Sunrise for Fox about three years earlier, but in this picture he's a master artisan demonstrating not only a knowledge of the subtler side of directing but in photography.|Fresh
Still quite eerie|Fresh
The first great vampire film, F.W. Murnau's silent classic... recreates the famous bloodsucker as a feral ghoul...|Fresh
|Fresh
Before there was Bela Lugosi, there was Max Schreck. Grab this ultimate edition of one of the greatest of all horror films, preferably during daylight hours.|Fresh
Watching Nosferatu is like standing in the same room as death itself.|Fresh
After the destruction was ordered of all negatives and prints, the story of Nosferatu's survival beyond death is almost as preternatural as Count Orlok's own shadowy existence.|Fresh
It is difficult to watch Nosferatu simply because it is so hard to find a decent copy of the film.|Fresh
A visual and emotional treat.|Fresh
FW Murnau's expressionist horror - and the world's first vampire film - still casts its long shadow over the history of both Germany and cinema|Fresh
The film shows Murnau's uncanny mixture of expressionism and location shooting at its finest.|Fresh
A masterpiece of the German silent cinema and easily the most effective version of Dracula on record.|Fresh
Murnau's classic vampire movie, though not his best film, remains one of the most poetic of all horror films.|Fresh
|Fresh
Freaky, lovely and very frightening.|Fresh
Murnau's horror masterwork features a treasure-trove of silent film techniques, unearthly locations and a truly horrid vampire played by Max Schreck.|Fresh
...the score by Christian Death, Electric Hellfire Club, and other post-pube gloomsters isn't ill-used here.... [The print] looks as though it's been run across a cheese grater.|Rotten
It's a visual marvel and a inventive landmark in filmmaking history, but it's also a bit too empty.|Fresh
A classic vampire experience!|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
The plot was stolen (from Stoker) without recompense. Also set lasting standards for horror film and film in general.|Fresh
|Fresh
A groundbreaking gothic film whose creative camerawork and dark cinematography is still copied in the movies of today.|Fresh
Almost unique in imagining a vampire who is not darkly attractive, but corpselike and ghastlyâ€¦ the imagery resists allegorization, remaining simply, unsettlingly, itself.|Fresh
The best, eeriest, most formally clever retelling of one of cinema's favorite stories.|Fresh
Essential classic Murnau Dracula film. Still the creepiest version.|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
In the realm of vampire films, this 1922 silent is the original motherlode. No one since has matched vampire Max Schreck's creepy loathsomeness.|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
A silent landmark that forged a genre through basic, often crude techniques of light, shadow, and special effects.|Fresh
|Fresh
This classic horror film is like a fine wine that only gets better with age...|Fresh
Brilliant artistry.|Fresh
...an achievement that reminds us that the simple, structured approaches towards the legend of Dracula are the ones that really terrify.|Fresh
Nosferatu stills could easily fill a solid wing at an art gallery-they wouldn't be out of place at the MOMA right next to its Picassos.|Fresh
The movie's two main strengths are Max Schreck's compelling performance, as the eerily inhuman vampire, and Murnau's unparallelled ability to blend naturalistic and expressionistic elements.|Fresh
Based illegally on Bram Stoker's Dracula, F. W. Murnau's film is undeniably the best and probably the most faithful of the myriad of films based on the novel.|Fresh
|Fresh
Like the message, the acting will strike contemporary audiences as near hysterical, yet the actors' expressionism is a perfect fit for the expressionism of the filmmaker.|Fresh
Nosferatu earns its place in the cinematic archives, but its accessibility to modern viewers is surely all but lost.|Rotten
|Fresh
One of the most haunting, atmospheric films I've ever seen.|Fresh
It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us. It shows not that vampires can jump out of shadows, but that evil can grow there, nourished on death.|Fresh
In the scores of vampire films that have followed Nosferatu in the subsequent decades, none have been able to match its physical beauty, its intensity of vision, or its grasp of true evil.|Fresh
While it clearly moves at a slower pace than most modern films, it is still one of the most beautiful and atmospheric horror pictures ever made.|Fresh
F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horror still has the power to chill the viewer, due in no small part to the amazing Max Schreck in the title role.|Fresh
As vampire movies go, few are more memorable than Nosferatu, which is not only the first screen version of Dracula, but, in some ways, remains the best.|Fresh
