What makes Deadpool a very, very special member of the Marvel Universe is that he rides that Bugs Bunny plane of existence where he has a direct, ongoing conversation with us, the audience.|Fresh
This movie is funny. Like, REALLY funny. In fact, I'd call it the funniest big-budget superhero movie that we've seen.|Fresh
He [Ryan Reynolds] has created a character that is charming, funny, snarky and uncouth with an edge of smugness, yet thanks to the dynamic charisma of both actor and character you are immediately drawn to him despite his faults.|Fresh
The best elements center around Reynolds and Baccarin, who both do great work in this one.|Fresh
Deadpool as a character is big and loud and borderline obnoxious so the movie around him does a great job of being small and focused, letting him steal the show.|Fresh
It is a nice change of pace that brings plenty of laughs and a bit of originality to the Marvel universe.|Fresh
Deadpool is a superb testing ground for a new generation of superpowered comedy.|Fresh
You've heard the story Deadpool tells a million times before; but the attitude with which it is told here makes it feel fresh and as close to innovative as you're going to see in a tentpole blockbuster anytime soon.|Fresh
Its two key errors are an assumption that breaking the fourth wall in itself denotes wit, and that when you have a smart idea, you're best off flogging it for all its worth.|Rotten
Deadpool does kind of feel like the Ant-Man of the Marvel Mutant Movies. If you know how I feel about Ant-Man, you know that's a compliment.|Fresh

If this is the sort of thing you generally like, this is a movie you will specifically love, and probably want to see again, right away.|Fresh
My cheeks are in literal pain right now because I was laughing so much in this movie, and whenever I wasn't doing that I was grinning in awe.|Fresh
It's a filling, deliberately over-loaded, spicy chimichanga combo platter of a film, and there isn't a kiddie table in the room.|Fresh
Parents will be flustered, uptight yuppies will be disgusted, and fans will be hopping in their seats with the kind of joy typically reserved for next-in-line at the bouncy castle.|Fresh
Overall a very well-produced movie. I only had a problem with some of the fight scenes and CGI...but I forgave that because the movie as a whole really entertained me.|Fresh
This movie is entertaining, romantic, and just fills you with a bubbly feeling in your loins.|Fresh
Deadpool manages to orchestrate outrageous and oversized riffs on genre hallmarks into something that works better and functions more enjoyably than that which it skewers.|Fresh
Invites you to giggle at the total self-seriousness and wackness of the genre as a whole.|Fresh
Something incredible has happened. Ryan Reynolds has finally found a vehicle worth his talents: bringing Deadpool to life and giving the superhero genre just the right smack it needs.|Fresh
It has a nice balance. It's never too much [fourth wall breaking], it's just enough to know that this is a different type of superhero and this is what he does.|Fresh
It might be one of the best movies that Marvel has ever produced.|Fresh
Deadpool's very own feature film is a riotous success laced with the fourth wall breaking, dick-joke quips, bloody dismemberment, and dementedly twisted snark people have come to love|Fresh
I like Reynolds as an actor, and even I was bored.|Rotten
Supported by a very clever script, Deadpool is deliciously irreverent, subversive and uproariously funny.|Fresh
The reason any of this works is because of one man. Ryan Reynolds is in the form of his life.|Fresh
There are echoes of Watchmen and Sin City to a film that eventually proves to have more style than substance.|Rotten
Deadpool is breezy and fun and more jokes land than not, and it openly derides the usual moralizing of superhero movies, instead gleefully pursuing brains-splattering violence and profanity.|Fresh
Be prepared to see this flick more than once; there is next to no down time in the whole affair since the quips fly at lightning pace.|Fresh
Hmmm, dark jokes disguising a possibly serious subtext. Now, isn't that ironic?|Fresh
Throughout the film that jolts the audience through starts and stops like a crazed bumper-car ride on acid, the promise and glimmers of genius are interspersed between the same old tropes the film attempts to subvert.|Rotten
Reynolds does a great job of juggling Deadpool's mania and Wade's fatalism while making sure that the character is still sympathetic in both modes.|Fresh
With the same goofiness and self-referential humor as a character like Spider-Man, but combined with the graphic violence most often seen in DC comics; perhaps Deadpool is just the perfect clash of contradictions.|Fresh
Tim Miller delivers a feat for his directorial debut, and on the superhero movie rating scale - which we can safely say has certainly had its ups and downs - Deadpool is pretty fresh.|Fresh
A more rebellious Deadpool would comment on how its climax looks just like every other Marvel climax, but instead there's safety to the tone that veers only from amusing to dull.|Rotten
There isn't an aspect of superhero lore that isn't rubbished by the Apatow-meets-Spider-Man comedy Deadpool. By the lights of this decade's movie making, that's a lot of rubbishing.|Fresh
Things drag in the movie's overly serious middle section, but Reynolds' gift for rapid-fire putdowns adds spice to the frenetic action.|Fresh
Deadpool boasts some great stylish action, and is probably the funniest movie of the young year.|Fresh
Deadpool tries so hard and is so trying.|Rotten
[Deadpool] the (anti)hero we didn't even know we needed.|Fresh
Much of Deadpool is a disreputable delight.|Fresh
Fans of the comics will probably be satisfied, but if you're looking for a genuinely weird comic book adaptation, you're better off watching Tank Girl or The Tick.|Rotten
"Starting with a sarcastic run of opening credits and consistently infused with the title character's vitriolic outbursts, the first solo outing for Marvel's ""Merc with a Mouth"" gets by strictly on attitude."|Fresh
Who needs a hero when you can have an entertaining antihero?|Fresh
An entertaining, refreshing action flick with enough genuine laughs to fill out the forgiving 108-minute run time.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds was born in a damn lab to play this role, and T.J. Miller is equally good as possibly the most realistic superhero sidekick ever.|Fresh
The funniest superhero movie I've ever seen. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a fun, hyper-violent, gleefully perverse frolic into the super-powered absurd.|Fresh
Deadpool is the kind of movie that will just get more marvellous each time it is viewed.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds, the king of charming smarminess, hits the big time.|Fresh
Deadpool does an impressive job of bringing its insane and loveable anti-hero to life, with energy and a level of detail that marks it apart.|Fresh
The thing you walk into it expecting it to be is completely and in all ways the thing that it is. This can be taken as both a good thing and a bad thing.|Fresh
A superhero film is only as good as the actor playing him and, if ever an actor was meant to play Deadpool, it is Ryan Reynolds.|Fresh
As far as origin stories go, this one's a blast, in no small measure due to Reynolds, who clearly relishes the part, and director Tim Miller, who keeps you entertained and amused throughout.|Fresh
Bloody and violent in all the right places and outrageously funny/filthy in all the wrong ones, too.|Fresh
A better, sharper, raunchier, and unapologetically entertaining movie experience that is up there with the best hard-core comic book movies.|Fresh
A relentlessly-hilarious cross of Kick-Ass (2013) and Watchmen (2009) that leaves your appetite whetted for a sequel.|Fresh
Deadpool is fleet, flippant and genuinely funny, peppered with pop-culture references, Marvel in-jokes and fourth-wall-breaking quips to the audience.|Fresh
Its been years in the making but fans of Marvel's incendiary, foul-mouthed anti-hero superhero Deadpool are finally getting a film, and it's the movie they've always wanted.|Fresh
Deadpool has some of the wit and satirical bite of [Zombieland] -- just enough to make up for the snark.|Fresh
Low-down dirty fun.|Fresh
Spectacularly unpleasant.|Rotten
Irreverent, outrageous, and strewn with self-aware commentary and dark humor, Deadpool (2016) is as different a comic book superhero movie from the self-serious Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice as you'll find.|Fresh
From the very opening minutes of the film, it is made abundantly clear that Deadpool -- a character in the latest among Marvel's long slate of upcoming superhero films -- is not like any other superhero.|Fresh
A crass, ornery heap of fun. It isn't close to perfect, but something of such high entertainment value doesn't have to be.|Fresh
A fast, funny, freak-flag-flying, four-letter-word-filled flick, making fun of the formulaic franchise and featuring Spider-Man's punk cousin, Deadpool (not his real cousin).|Fresh
A hilarious, ultra-violent and therefore fairly faithful adaptation of the cult comic book character, that you wouldn't see elsewhere in Marvel's overbearing, overly serious superhero universe.|Fresh
It looks the clichs right in the eye, brings them in for a warm bear hug, and slyly sinks a katana in their unsuspecting backs.|Fresh
"""Deadpool"" is with spirit but without gumption, smarts, or conviction."|Rotten
Deadpool brandishes its meta-credentials with the title character's cocky, abrasive relish.|Fresh
'Deadpool' isn't your dad's superhero movie.|Fresh
Irreverent and incorrigible, Deadpool pricks the pomposity of your average Hollywood comic book movie with a delicious laugh-out-loud script.|Fresh
The LGBT movement gets an ostensibly unwelcome filmic addition in the guise of Ryan Reynolds's wisecracking bi-sexual mercenary Wade Wilson.|Rotten
It is, in fact, every bit as a gutsy, cheeky and an incredibly fun as you'd imagined, but it's also a film that, when stripped down to the bare bones, deals with the basic idea of an antihero better than most.|Fresh
The primogenitor of Deadpool is Dennis Miller's '90s standup: sneering, smarmy, arch, and peppered with pop-culture references|Rotten
I'm not sure if this has the material to justify multiple sequels but as a stand-alone superhero movie, it's about as much fun as you could ask for.|Fresh
The timing is impeccable: It hardly seems a coincidence that Deadpool's startling popularity has occurred in parallel to the establishment-gigging rise of another rude, self-confident outlier, Donald Trump.|Fresh
Lavishly vulgar, completely disrespectful, gratuitously bloody -- and an awful lot of tasteless fun if you're not turned off by those things.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds becomes a certified movie star. DEADPOOL makes all the other superhero characters look like relics from the 1950s - except the Black Widow.|Fresh
Superhero movies have long needed a character as twisted as Deadpool. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With a deliciously subversive approach, Deadpool is sure to be one the year's blockbusters.|Fresh
He smirks and makes terrible jokes and makes you laugh, and still gets the girl. What more do you want from a comic book character?|Fresh
Deadpool is to the superhero genre what Shane Black's Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is to Detective Noir and Hollywood.|Fresh
Blithely acerbic and loopily enthusiastic in turn, complete with mocking comments direct to the camera, Ryan Reynolds plays the Marvel Comics character Deadpool... as an antidote to the solemn superhero industry.|Fresh

Deadpool, regardless if it's good or bad, still deserves some degree of credit for how entertaining it manages to be. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Tim Miller, whose background is in VFX houses and animated segments from the likes of Thor: The Dark World, adheres to stock-standard, CG-assisted thrills from the word go.|Rotten
Playful, irreverent and loads of fun.|Fresh

The terrible truth is that 'Deadpool' is not worth to disconnect a few hours of reality. Ends up depleting saturation. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
In the Marvel Universe of movies, this one has one of the smallest budgets, with no big name stars, but the filmmakers use humor to turn this into a positive.|Fresh
In what appears to be an unofficial global apology for his dead-in-the-water performance in the 2011 debacle The Green Lantern, Ryan Reynolds pushes hard on his funny buttons in this try-hard superhero pseudo-send up.|Fresh
Some of the jokes in Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick's script (from the Marvel comics by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza) are pretty funny, which helps compensate for the dreary familiarity of the CGI fight scenes.|Fresh
The spandex-stretches of irreverence and genre ridicule do enough to dress up what remains a formulaic story. When the scoffs turns smirky, though, Deadpool gets tiresome.|Fresh
Undoubtedly one of the new century's few effective comic-book adaptations...|Fresh
A completely unique take on the superhero genre. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool is dead-on with its sense of humor and incisive wit, and while it doesn't thoroughly skewer superhero movies or take note of the current climate, it tends to nail any target in its crosshairs.|Fresh
It's a milestone of the superhero genre, delivering an effective adult movie that's full of fun. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Witless, wisecracking, lewd and irreverent Marvel's comic-book creation.|Rotten
It is an enormous contributor to dumbing down a relatively new film genre straining for credibility and American culture in general.|Rotten
Complaints about the smallness of the film aside, it's also a helluva a lot of fun to see Deadpool in a hard 'R.'|Fresh
Deadpool fans and comic fans should love this movie.|Fresh
An exhausting, grating experience, lacking in wit and cleverness as it crumbles underneath its wall-to-wall torrent of jokes.|Rotten
Sit back, relax and enjoy this unpatronising, entertaining and utterly filthy movie.|Fresh
A self-parodic comedy with several action, slow-motion sequences, CGI and dueling muscles. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As predictable as its plotting may be, as much as it rehearses comic book movie conventions while acting like it's above that fray, too smart by half, Deadpool benefits from Ryan Reynolds' snarky comic performance.|Rotten
Ryan Reynold finally does justice to the character in this hillarious R rated superhero movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool's intention is not to amaze us with a strong and exciting story, but to make us partakers of the nonsense of its protagonist, which makes surprisingly well. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
On the face of being saturated by superhero movies, self parody seems to be the right way to go. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Both the filmmakers and the characters on-screen are so pleased with themselves that this might just be the smuggest movie ever made.|Fresh
Full of violence, a couple of X-men, and plenty of jokes, this film delivers entertainment on every level. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool is the perfecto film for those who want a superhero movie that embraces everything that's polliticaly incorrect. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""I may be super, but I'm no hero,"" declares the title character. He is not lying."|Fresh
Exactly the movie you expect out of this character, and, well, how awesome is that?|Fresh
The film is a spectacular achievement, a true portrayal of the character's irreverence with own irreverence, a comedy that defies genres and an action movie that don't get lost in the clich. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool is a carefully made, often hilarious action picture with heart and passion, brought to us by filmmakers who embrace the spirit of the source material.|Fresh
This is enthusiastically outrageous throughout.|Fresh
Captures everything about the comic book that's managed to win over superhero weary fans for many years.|Fresh
However much the raunchy humor and postmodern genre disemboweling works, what I appreciated most about Deadpool is that the stakes were decidedly personal-intimate, even.|Fresh
A reference isn't a joke, and I didn't find Deadpool - the movie or the character - funny at all.|Rotten
Vulgar, violent and incredibly funny. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that makes constant jokes about cliches and that somehow is full of them. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten

Deadpool is different from most superhero movies that have been made in recent years, the proposal is fresh and different thanks to the nature of its protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that was made with love and respect to the original material that is refreshing and audiences will enjoy from beginning to end. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool knows he's in Yet Another Superhero Movie, and, by skewering the idea of Yet Another Superhero Movie, assures that this is not really Yet Another Superhero Movie.|Fresh
In an era of increasingly reluctant and angst-riddled crusaders, [Deadpool] makes being a superhero look fun.|Fresh
A funny, fresh and undeniably self-deprecating hero is enough to make this Marvel movie stand out among its peers.|Fresh
The film's emphasis on deconstruction rather than destruction does mean that everything - from the action to the character beats - operates on a smaller scale. In an age of boring spectacle, that seems more radical than anything else.|Fresh
Deadpool may not be the best superhero film ever made but, boy oh boy, is it the gutsiest.|Fresh
It's deliberately puerile, often joyously, sometimes annoyingly, but never dull as the filmmakers have a blast revelling in general superhero movie misbehaviour.|Fresh
Deadpool has been a labour of love for star Ryan Reynolds and he is the reason to see the film.|Fresh
You wanna see Stan Lee DJ at a strip club? Well now you can.|Fresh
Even though Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is strikingly reminiscent of Stephen J. Cannell's appealing anti-hero PI James Rockford, this is just another superhero movie filled with boring sameness. How many times can one sit through the same thing?|Rotten
For the most part it's crudely disreputable fare, buoyed up by ironic bubblegum tunes ...|Fresh
Entertaining, but a little schizophrenic.|Fresh
The casting of a hunk to play the hero and a hunk to play the villain is indicative of a film that wants to appear to take risks while not really taking any at all.|Rotten
A superhero romp that threatened to be smug, smarmy and self-satisfied is -- well, yes, it's occasionally all those things. But it's also fresh, funny and absolutely kick-ass.|Fresh
"Smart-aleck, teenage boys now have their ""Citizen Kane."""|Fresh
Scornful, satirical and surprislingly snarky - with two, teasing post-credit sequences.|Fresh
Bursting at the seams with dick jokes, boob shots and larky splatter, Deadpool is simultaneously the most 'adult' Marvel movie to date and the most supremely juvenile.|Fresh
For a film obviously positioned as a franchise starter, its sardonic antihero takes a new path during his origin story, and his big-screen debut stands capably on its own.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds (...) does more a stand up narrative, than a performance or cinematic narrative. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deadpool is full of the best intentions and fan service, but it is also a victim of its very limited budget. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This comic book superhero comedy is just plain super fun , a raunchy movie that parodies the whole genre while still honoring it. Ryan Reynolds has found a vehicle worth his talents.|Fresh
It is more a character study than a superhero adventure. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's great humor from beginning to end with action sequences that are on par with the jokes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Despite some notable flaws, Deadpool is just what superhero cinema needs. It's a shot of adrenaline directly into the Marvel nervous system.|Fresh
An antihero who's sarcastic, profane, self-aware and funny as hell, a cathartic break from the portentous comic-book flicks saturating the release slate these days.|Fresh
"A film so fun you will leave the theatre sayin: ""lets go get some chimichangas!"". [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
True to the character, this film is now a classic in Ryan Reynolds' filmography. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Snarky, crude, irreverent - if this is what you are looking for in an action movie then you have some to the right place.|Fresh
It's still a superhero movie that has the 'hero' protagonist, the big baddie and lots of romance. But it also goes surprisingly beyond the usual tropes of action. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This one's got attitude. If only it weren't quite so self-satisfied with that attitude. And not entirely justified in it, either.|Rotten
"If it were a regular R-rated comedy, Deadpool's ""taboo"" ingredients wouldn't be considered boundary-breaking at all. But in a superhero movie, this stuff feels revolutionary."|Fresh
Watching Deadpool feels a bit like downing a shot of something stiff, while simultaneously having the same again thrown in your face. It's bracing, and if you're not ready for it, it can rock you back on your heels.|Fresh
Thankfully, amid the sweaty mayhem there's a particularly sweet love story. Baccarin takes the role of Vanessa and clearly has a ball early doors as she matches Reynolds stride for stride.|Fresh
Deadpool hooks you into Wade's trauma, but mostly it's content to skate along on the cheekiness of his death-sport attitude. The film's airy cynicism says: he's not the hero we dream of, he's just the one we deserve.|Fresh
Deadpool, much like its source material, is an irreverent, bloody, and riotous twist on the superhero genre - a must-see comic book movie experience.|Fresh
Deadpool may not be the superhero movie we deserve. But, after an onslaught of increasingly formulaic big-screen adventures with ever-escalating stakes, it just might be the superhero movie we need.|Fresh
It's a tangy olio that lacks substance and consistency, and despite that, its in-your-face moxie comes at you in all the right ways, gripping you by the gunny sack with a big glorious joker smile and never letting go.|Fresh
There are dozens of entertaining pop culture references, and even the opening credits have a self-mocking tone. It starts off flat, but then, about 20 minutes in, takes off. The end result is surprising and a lot of fun.|Fresh
"While the ""Merc with a Mouth"" is a novel and undeniably funny superhero film, like a relentless case of the runs, Deadpool's torrent of inappropriate/​smart-aleck jokes and pop culture references can be exhausting."|Fresh
By the end of Deadpool I was left with the feeling that it probably was more fun to make than it is to watch.|Rotten
Deadpool had me laughing from the clever opening credits to Ryan Reynolds' just as clever credit roll outtake. This is what Spider-man's two franchises should have been.|Fresh
Deadpool may be the comic book movie spoof to end all comic book movie spoofs.|Fresh
Deadpool is a deeply funny, relatable mutant hero.|Fresh
Amazing feature debut by Tim Miller. Plays to Reynolds strengths. Best opening credits ever. Funny and raunchy as heck. Zoolander who?|Fresh
Gory, profane, sexy superhero story great, but NOT for kids.|Fresh
"Sharing more in common with ""Kick-Ass 2"" than ""Kick-Ass,"" the long gestating ""Deadpool"" comic adaptation pulls no punches."|Fresh
My mom loved it.|Fresh
"""Deadpool"" surprised me a lot by how much irreverent fun it actually is. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"|Fresh
It's a welcome palate cleanser in a world where comic book flicks are increasingly ponderous and repetitive (see: the latest Batman v Superman: Rise of the Chins trailer).|Fresh
If ever an actor was born to play a motormouthed, juvenile masked creep, it was Ryan Reynolds to play Deadpool.|Fresh
Deadpool delivers on its gleefully profane promise within the first five seconds of the film.|Fresh
"""Deadpool"" is not so much a movie as an extended inside joke with a movie wrapped around it, plus an abject apology for Green Lantern."|Fresh
Dizzyingly scabrous, borderline offensive (alright!) and wonderfully refreshing.|Fresh
kudos to Fox for having the stones to give this one the full inappropriate R-rated treatment.|Fresh
Right from the opening credits, the audience realizes they are in for something a bit twisted and lacking any reverence (and that's a good thing).|Fresh
Reynolds has never meshed as well with a character or found a better outlet for his smirking, smart aleck persona.|Fresh
It's bloody good fun, kicking off with a tremendous opening-credits sequence and a terrifically entertaining action set piece. Reynolds is wonderfully fun. He's a chiseled movie star, to be sure, but he's always best when he can goof on the part.|Fresh
He swears like a sailor, he fills every conversation with sexual innuendo and generally behaves like a hyperactive teenager. But utterly oozing with charisma.|Fresh
"Much more so than Marvel's ""Guardian of the Galaxy,"" ""Deadpool"" is a film propelled by swagger, humor and action."|Fresh
Much of the success in bringing it off is due to Ryan Reynolds, whose film career often seen him trapped in roles that didn't make good use of his talents...|Fresh
This is a different kind of movie. The only rule it adheres to is that tropes are made to be eviscerated, turned on their heads, and trampled over.|Fresh
Behind all the glibness, all the gore, Deadpool is actually a rather poignant romance. I quite liked it, although it's not nearly as funny as its debutant director Tim Miller seems to think it is.|Fresh
Deadpool's relentless pace is refreshing, and so is the sense that viewers will be able to keep up.|Fresh
In a landscape where superhero roles are too often seen as paycheck parts, Reynolds breaks the mold. Too bad his film doesn't.|Fresh
A welcome acid corrective to the machine-tooled, marketing-driven product lapped up by the multiplex masses.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds hasn't had the best luck with superhero cinema. So I'm happy to report that Deadpool is an insane, anarchic riot of a movie.|Fresh
It's a guilty pleasure of a superhero movie that feels as naughty and as reckless as its central character intends. In that regard, it's mission more than accomplished.|Fresh
For all the creakiness of its plotting, this is a Marvel adaptation mercifully shorn of bombast. There is far more bite in its humour than in last year's Ant-Man. Reynolds plays the lead role in an enjoyably freewheeling fashion.|Fresh
You're initially jazzed by his effrontery, but Deadpool, with his relentlessly glib, nothing-sacred attitude, is not an individual who wears particularly well.|Rotten
Most importantly of all, the film is bloody hilarious.|Fresh
The movie delivers... in bloody spades.|Fresh
Deadpool was supposed to be a satirical masterpiece that pilloried the absurdities of the comic-book movie universe. It's not.|Rotten
Going all-in on its outrageous content means Deadpool does stand out from the horde of superhero movies, mostly for its potty mouth...|Fresh
this movie's junky feel is part of its charm. Sure it goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness. Still, Deadpool is party time for action junkies and Reynolds may just have found the role that makes his career.|Fresh
It's not subversive - it's meant to elasticize and enhance the superhero genre, to flatter the audience for being hip enough to get all of those in-jokes. And I was flattered.|Fresh
Deadpool is the 'edgy' stand-up hired to play the corporate gig: make the company laugh, but don't make the company mad.|Fresh
Deadpool ... has the singular virtue of being funnier than we've been led to believe a superhero film can be.|Fresh
There aren't many superhero movies that exploit the liberating effects of the hard-R rating. But to me, the mock opening credits are the only detail that is fresh - sophomoric, but fresh.|Rotten
Refreshingly crass.|Fresh
Beneath the layers of the faade, this really is just your normal, average superhero movie.|Rotten
Reynolds' mighty mutant title character is anything but a conventional superdude, even before he acquires his extreme skills, red-hooded cosplay costume and scarred face and mind.|Fresh
Deadpool is, on the whole, a big bowl of fun filled with great stunts, gory fight scenes, and sexy poses.|Fresh
If you are willing to accept a superpowered character who spits at superhero conventions, then Deadpool is a (expletive deleted) good time.|Fresh
"This R-rated, pop culture riffing, wisecracking subversive antihero is a hell of a lot of fun to hang out with, which is a good thing because the jokes fly so fast and furiously you'll probably have to watch ""Deadpool"" multiple times to catch them all."|Fresh
The winter movie doldrums finally got their wake-up call - and it's a crank.|Fresh
A too-cool thrill ride filled with all of the saturated fats of shameless '80s trash . . . as satisfying as a bacon double cheeseburger with a side of crack.|Fresh
Imagine Spider-Man with legitimately funny quips, waaay less angst, and a bug-eyed getup that's lethally accessorized.|Fresh
The film is as postmodernly self-referential as it can get, which should be a hoot for the average viewer and nirvana for connoisseurs of the Marvel Universe.|Fresh
Fans of X-Men will gobble it up, especially lewd teenage boys; newcomers to the Marvel Universe may miss some of the best zingers.|Fresh
"The filmmakers do a lot of winking and rib poking; they sell ""Deadpool"" so hard that you might wonder if Marvel has started to pay on commission."|Rotten
(Reynolds) delivers a perfect combination of kick-ass and smart-ass.|Fresh
The dirtiness that Deadpool injects into the squeaky-clean Marvel universe makes it into an energizing and eminently quotable blast.|Fresh
It's really bloody and really fun.|Fresh
Deadpool's flawed insolence is appealing, like a mangy pup crawling into your lap.|Fresh
Director Tim Miller and star Ryan Reynolds embrace this flawed hero, delivering an irreverent - and graphic - comedy that ranks as one of the best Marvel films to date.|Fresh
An exercise in following established formula while pretending to subvert it by slyly pointing out its absurdities and adding all sorts of nasty pop culture references and profane asides to the mix.|Rotten
Just what a lot of fans have been waiting for---especially if they've been waiting for a superhero who swears, farts, babbles, jokes, listens to Wham!, loves unicorns and enjoys rough sex.|Fresh
"Smart, sexy and outrageous, ""Deadpool"" delivers."|Fresh
Deadpool is certainly rough around the edges, but that's his - and the film's - charm.|Fresh
An anti-superhero movie (or maybe a super-antihero movie) that might have worked if it had the courage of its lack of convictions.|Rotten
"""Deadpool"" gives the superhero genre a kick in its pearly white teeth - and, for good measure, every other square inch of its pumped-up body."|Fresh
"Calling Deadpool ""just another comic book movie"" would do injustice to a film that makes a strong effort to deliver something different."|Fresh
It's a voraciously self-aware comedy, one that dines out on the inherent inanity of its own premise as much as it does the movies it's competing with.|Fresh
This is bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it's just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema's future.|Rotten
Deadpool, intended as a spiky antidote to superhero oversaturation, ends up impaling only itself.|Rotten
Deadpool succeeds where other irreverent send-ups of the genre failed... [But] the over-the-top mayhem, do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth trash talk, and jokey cynicism can't stop [it] from hurtling toward predictability.|Fresh
"""Deadpool"" made not be known to a wider audience, and he's certainly not a courageous figure, but his debut is one of the better ones in the Marvel universe, adding some needed filth to the superhero routine."|Fresh
Maximally cheeky. Perversely potty-mouthed. Riotously funny. Insanely violent. Uneven as all get out. And fun, fun, fun.|Fresh
"It takes a strong stomach for extreme violence and over-the-top obscenity, but if you're willing to roll with that, ""Deadpool"" is a hoot."|Fresh
The story is nothing special, but Reynolds and Miller make it fun by sheer force of their enthusiasm for the material.|Fresh
A wonderfully puerile claret-soaked swear-fest (and) hands down the funniest superhero movie ever.|Fresh
Given how feebly some superhero films struggle under their own weight, Deadpool is impressively nimble. And it pulls off its relentless self-reference with a confidence that's solidly entertaining, even if it isn't always endearing.|Fresh
The shock and glory is seeing this loopy sensibility transferred to the screen with little softening and no apology.|Fresh
DP is a lot more fun than most superheroes, but the film is barely able to take advantage.|Fresh
Mostly Reynolds is really funny, joyfully debasing himself and putting everything he has into making this the giddiest, most enjoyable Deadpool movie imaginable.|Fresh
[Deadpool] is filthy, degenerate and seriously pervy, and Reynolds -- decked out in red and black spandex, sporting two katanas and white canvas where eyes should be -- is every bit as flip, funny, nasty and self-deprecating as you'd want.|Fresh
In the end, it's hard to shake the feeling that they've made a movie for boys that only adults are allowed to see. For the future sleepover party where some open-minded parent allows a screening, it'll surely be a blast.|Rotten
Deadpool has arrived, and the comic-book movie will never be the same. That's a good thing. Sameness is just one element of the genre that this exceptionally bonkers, hyper-violent, hilarious film pokes a hole in.|Fresh
Deadpool is funny -- frequently hilarious.|Fresh
Deadpool is essentially the world's first superhero fan movie.|Fresh
If only Deadpool were as clever, dark and funny as it believes itself to be.|Rotten
The plot is tragically tedious and predictable... But the denouement is a complete delight thanks to Reynolds, who acrobatically defies the gravitas of Superman while letting his natural charm ooze through the suit.|Fresh
Weak villains and an unsatisfying revenge plot ultimately hold it back from being something more distinctive, but Deadpool delivers a large dose of unwholesome fun.|Fresh
[Reynolds] brings a ton of compassion and manic energy ... [but Deadpool] is a cartoon in the real world that never goes crazy enough.|Rotten
"While ""Deadpool"" heralds the arrival of a talented new director, its success belongs to Reynolds, who also served as a producer."|Fresh
Funny and zippy though it is, 'Deadpool' is the safe, studio-sanctioned version of 'edgy.'|Fresh
A terrifically faithful adaptation of some awfully obnoxious source material.|Fresh
Deadpool is arguably the most faithful and entertaining cinematic interpretation of the character that fans are likely to see.|Fresh
"""Deadpool"" might feel innovative, but the story itself is standard-issue."|Fresh
Deadpool is very good at what it sets out to do some of the time, and it's going to do exceedingly well because of this.|Fresh
Profane, violent and deliciously depraved, it's one of the most start-to-finish enjoyable comic-book movie this side of 2008's original Iron Man.|Fresh
"""Deadpool"" fails to live up to the potential of its beloved source material, subverting its own agenda by becoming a remarkably generic, by-the-numbers man-in-tights flick."|Rotten
May not be wildly fresh, but it does wriggle against its genre straightjacket, and if it doesn't quite escape, it puts on a great show in the process.|Fresh
Deadpool plays like a dim 15-year-old's impression of what a grown-up superhero film might look like.|Rotten
Reynolds is entertaining; it's rather sweet to see this eternally not-quite-a-star get closer than usual to justifying star billing.|Fresh
The politically incorrect material suits Ryan Reynolds as snugly as Marvel's tight red costume, giving the Canadian actor a chance to work out his mutant power for hurling snarky one-liners.|Fresh
Reynolds' giddiness at playing this insane, virtually indestructible mercenary has an infectious quality about it, and helps the gags that do hit to soar.|Fresh
If it doesn't grab you with the opening credits, you're in the wrong movie.|Fresh
Deadpool avoids enough pitfalls to both embrace and flamb the superhero genre while also finding time for romance, doling out equal handfuls of bullets, barbs and warm fuzzies.|Fresh
Deadpool is at once a welcome antidote to the played out superhero universe and an anomaly, destined to be trapped in its spandexed outliers.|Fresh
Deadpool is like Die Hard with Bruce Willis' character David Addison from his TV series Moonlighting, if he wore a mask & cursed more... It's silly, swaggering, & obscene, but I mean all of those words in the best possible way.|Fresh
Callous, crass, unpleasantly smug. Supposes it's being edgy because its protagonist swears a lot, but it's like a child saying bad words just to be naughty.|Rotten
If Deadpool is the ultimate anti-hero, then this is the ultimate anti-movie.|Rotten
It extends its middle finger to the concept of suspension of disbelief with repeated fourth wall breaks, while the references come thick, fast and proudly unsubtle.|Fresh
Deadpool is the bloodiest, darkest, most violent, and most hysterical comic book film to ever be released. Vulgarity hasn't been utilized this proficiently since the South Park film was released in theaters nearly two decades ago.|Fresh
As funny and charming as tearing a toenail.|Rotten
Tries to rebel but it's as insubordinate as a kid wearing a Megadeth T-shirt to Church on a Sunday, but an okay break from saving the world.|Fresh
Frankly, exuberantly nasty - in the nicest possible way.|Fresh
Deadpool is over-the-top funny, very bloody, violent and the best Marvel movie that's made for adults ! Not bad for an anti-hero that wears a mask, swings ninja swords and cannot die.|Fresh
The superhero genre is in trouble.|Fresh
Marvel (Fox) have rewritten the rules of the superhero genre with this offering.|Fresh
In many respects it's the best X-Men movie yet, because it seems to care less about 'world building' and 'big ideas' than about a single interesting character with a unique voice, joking his way through a satisfying, albeit conventional story.|Fresh
Early on, Deadpool teases audiences that it's going to lead a comedy-laced comic-book movie revolution, but it ends up joining the superhero establishment.|Rotten
You'd be hard-pressed to find a comic book film so faithful to the tone of its source material and absolutely nailing it. Cue Deadpool winking at the double entendre.|Fresh
A Marvel movie for those who think they're sick of Marvel movies but aren't really, it's as epically pleased with itself as Ryan Reynolds' lead performance.|Rotten
Oh, boy - is he fresh! Chances are you're going to love this well-written, witty, funny, romantic, sexy, silly, action packed, wild ride. I sure did!|Fresh
Deadpool stretches beyond sheer fan service to deliver a unique take on [superhero movies] that audiences unfamiliar with the character will enjoy as well.|Fresh
Just as Deadpool himself wears a mask to hide his hideous features, Deadpool conceals a highly conventional origin story under a lot of winking self-awareness.|Fresh
I found myself both enjoying the character and certain gags while wishing I could skip ahead 2-3 years to see the presumably superior sequel.|Rotten
Deadpool can fancy itself up as much as it wants and insist it's something totally different. But, yep, here we are: Another superhero movie origin story.|Rotten
Pointing out how crappy other movies are doesn't automatically make your movie good.|Rotten
Rarely boring, but not half as smart, funny or subversive as it clearly believes itself to be.|Rotten
A relentlessly-hilarious cross of Kick-Ass (2013) and Watchmen (2009) that leaves your appetite whetted for a sequel.|Fresh
"""Deadpool fans will be gratified to see their meta merc smirking, stabbing and snarking his way through his foes, stopping long enough to make a bunch of dick jokes, before it's back to the action."""|Fresh
The cynicism is so blatant and unpleasant, but seemingly pointed at nothing, that I found it draining to watch.|Rotten
Deadpool only reinforces the genre expectations of the superhero movie, hoping that a string of winks to the camera, and the occasional flash of nudity will distract from what is ultimately, a very by-the-book story.|Rotten
Deadpool benefits from an intimate story with more heart than you would expect, but also a go-for-broke zeal, edging at times into Naked Gun-style parody.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds slays in the role he was born to play.|Fresh
Sure, it's about as shocking as a middle schooler giving his teacher the finger, but there's something adorable about that kind of juvenile nonsense.|Fresh
Reynolds ... gives the best comedic performance the genre has ever seen ...|Fresh
Unapologetically by fans, for fans.|Fresh
Profane, hyper-violent, and never hesitant to take things a step or two beyond overkill, Deadpool is just the swift kick to the junk the genre needs.|Fresh
A fun, if patchy, alternative to the glut of 'the world is about to end unless we do something' comic-book films.|Fresh
This isn't the future of superhero movies, but it's an enjoyably obnoxious detour.|Fresh
Loud, lewd, inventive and outrageous, Deadpool is a delight.|Fresh
Deadpool is neurotic and needy - and very entertaining. An innocent pleasure.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds gets the full-throttle wisecracking showcase he deserves in this scabrously funny origin story.|Fresh
It's fun, but it's not for everyone, and definitely not for families.|Fresh
A really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos, as well as the first Marvel film to irreverently trash the brand.|Fresh
Ryan Reynolds, who played a misbegotten faux-Deadpool in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and has nobly spent the subsequent six years trying to atone by doing it right, may finally have found his defining role|Fresh
Anarchic, outrageous and filthily funny, this tongue-in-cheek X-Men movie tears up the superhero rulebook from within.|Fresh
The most romantic Marvel film since Steve Rogers first wooed Peggy Carter.|Fresh
"In its foul-mouthed, aggressively violent way, ""Deadpool"" proves to be nasty fun, casting a snotty Ryan Reynolds as a vengeance-seeking jerk who may have mutant powers but never acquired the stoicism or valor of the X-Men."|Fresh
It may not be original, but what the film lacks in freshness it makes up in cinematic bravura, from 'breaking the fourth wall' (talking to the audience) to self referential nonsense amidst violent mayhem|Fresh
Next to Deadpool, Tony Stark is that annoying uncle who loves to tell old knock-knock jokes. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
It's a film that's amused with itself, but thanks to a screwball screenplay by Rhett Rheese and Paul Wernick and a charmingly snarky lead turn by Ryan Reynolds, that amusement is both thoroughly earned and completely contagious.|Fresh
I'll just marvel at the fact that Fox finally grew the jooblies to let this film happen.|Fresh
The whiplash contrasts between snideness and sincerity are deeply rooted in the main character's psychology.|Fresh
With Fox's Deadpool movie, a new superhero icon has been born, and he just tea-bagged us all.|Fresh
Deadpool is a blissfully unique and hilarious action-packed blockbuster that stands as one of the best big-screen superhero origin stories that we've had the pleasure of seeing.|Fresh
"Justice has finally been done to the ""Merc with a Mouth."" Is it the next Citizen Kane? No. Is it the perfect Deadpool movie? You bet."|Fresh
"While there have been other R-rated comic book movies and even superhero sex scenes (hello ""Watchmen""!), none revel in it quite like ""Deadpool"" does."|Fresh
