A singular survival tale in space, Gravity is an experience that marvels and mesmerizes.|Fresh
...a very simplistic story against some incredible achievement in visual effects and filmmaking craft.|Fresh
It's hard to deny the spectatorial awe that Cuarón has engendered by the story's end as the film's very title (and theme) of gravity reaches a moving and emotional conclusion.|Fresh
...[a] wondrous package of technological achievement. The human feelings of hopelessness and the instinctual need to exist in the madness of fear and frustration is the calling card that really gives this game-changing gem its captivating conviction|Fresh
It is complex and profound without being pretentious or pedantic. In fact, if anything, its simplicity highlights the film's depth and study in contrasts. I thought it was a moving, beautiful, unique movie.|Fresh
It's got all the spectacle that your average audience wants to see, but also has enough thought and artistry to satisfy the true cinephile as well.|Fresh
Gravity really is the closest 99.99% of us will ever get to being in space, and it was beautiful.|Fresh
The screenwriters fill this chamber piece in space with loads of sentimentality.|Rotten
The searing action is never repetitive, and every frame is inspired. I'll pay to see this thrilling and wonderfully realized survival adventure again because the visual elements,... made the film taunt with breath-catching tension.|Fresh
What makes this by far the best film of the year is not the haiku-like storyline or Stone's heart-stopping scramble... but the tears. Gravity is one of the most outrageously emotionally manipulative films I have ever seen.|Fresh

Those of us who have never traveled beyond the earth's atmosphere -- hell, maybe even those who have -- will be easily convinced that Cuaron's outer space is the real deal.|Fresh
It's horrifying (and gorgeous), and you'll be thankful you're planted securely in your theater seat.|Fresh
This certain best-picture nominee sounds almost as good as it looks.|Fresh
It's an amazing feat of filmmaking, but where Cuarn should have applied similar elbow grease was on the script.|Fresh
Gravity is a movie of elegant beauty and surprising emotional power.|Fresh
The hype for Cuarn's ambitious Gravity has been . . . well . . . out of this world. Critics have fallen over themselves praising the film and I went into the theater expecting very big things indeed. I hate to say this, but I didn't love it.|Rotten
Gravity should be getting award consideration in several categories. Its spectacular cinematography creates a powerful juxtaposition between the sublime beauty of the cosmos and its powerful isolation.|Fresh
Cuaron keeps his film as realistic as it can get. No melodrama, no far-fetched stylised action scenes or convenient plot twists. The film stays unpredictable till the end.|Fresh
I adore this movie on every level...|Fresh
Whatever is achieved here visually is never really matched by a profound narrative.|Rotten
With its themes of spirituality, religion, birth, rebirth and hope, Gravity is a film that will move audiences in different ways. That's the beauty of it; it transcends genres, generations and time, a modern classic.|Fresh
A survival drama set almost entirely in the unfathomable abyss of outer space, Gravity is something now quite rare -- a truly popular big-budget Hollywood movie with a rich aesthetic pay-off.|Fresh
Gravity is less a feature film than cinema as experience: a new frontier in filmmaking that will appeal to studios trying to attract people to movie theaters.|Fresh
It's the very definition of a thriller, from the mysterious locale to the unpredictably tumultuous events containing no hope of survival.|Fresh
It is a big, bold picture that refuses to be timid, and it left me trembling. It's not just a film; it's something that happens to you.|Fresh
It is exhilarating film-making, engineered with dizzying invention, and it combines commanding 3D digital effects -- some of the best I've ever seen -- with a surprisingly soulful touch.|Fresh
Gravity becomes a character study driven by a riveting central performance and a radical thrill ride delivered with near real-time urgency which thrusts you through its implausibilities.|Fresh
Beautiful and poetic, the image of small humans in fathomless space is also elegiac and eventually frightening.|Fresh
Gravity dazzles with images that place us at the center of space flight...but keeps yanking us into a contrived fantasy version of space in which, among other things, the world's space stations are all lined up, like a low-orbit trailer park.|Rotten
So it was good, if a bit jarring, to feel myself shrink at the film's beginning, when I found myself floating above the surface of the earth for a little while in absolute silence.|Fresh
The film's impressiveness begins and ends with its sizzle-reel mentality, never amounting to much more than a dazzling technical exercise starring some really famous people.|Rotten
A work of techno-art, with images of humbling grandeur and scenes almost painful in the depth of horror they evoke.|Fresh
The CGI is flawless, and the beautiful shot construction is staggering.|Fresh
You don't have to love sci-fi to love Gravity, you just have to love the power of cinema to provide a transcendent experience.|Fresh
One of the greatest man-versus-nature movies in cinematic history.|Fresh
$90,000,000, a hundred, whatever they spent: this is a taut thriller built for audiences but also one of the most expensive experimental movies ever made. It's a thrill ride, but a work by a visual artist at the extremes of his acuity.|Fresh
An escape from the past that is simultaneously a flight to no future.|Rotten
One of the most amazingly immersive movies ever made, even on the small screen|Fresh
One of the best science fiction movies in years.|Fresh
This is a story about people floating through space, and Alfonso Cuarn's feature brilliantly contrives to make the viewer feel similarly untethered, to often thrilling effect. This is surely the closest cinema comes to three-dimensional virtual abseiling.|Fresh
I want to give Alfonso Cuarn's transformative masterpiece all the stars in the sky, but a glowing five will have to do for this wondrous piece of movie-making magic.|Fresh
It's a breathtaking masterpiece, a work of art, and a technical marvel, one that needs to be on your Blu-ray shelf from day one.|Fresh
The single most stressful two hours you can have in a movie theatre - in the best possible way.|Fresh
Surely there are Oscar nominations for all involved, and Gravity is set to be a classic.|Fresh
What could easily have been a dull practice in CGI is crafted by Alfonso Cuaron in to a journey for survival and learning how to cherish life...|Fresh
For all the complicated CG wizardry and ostensibly visionary gloss...[Gravity] is aesthetically and structurally regressive.|Rotten
We've seen films set in outer space before, but nothing has ever felt this real.|Fresh
A sleek, smooth, immersive, and rather overwhelming spectacle of economy, efficiency, and all-around proficiency.|Fresh
One of the ten best films of 2013.|Fresh
If Cuarn's long-gestating thriller is perhaps not quite the masterpiece we were hoping for, it is still a thrilling and visually striking work.|Fresh
A marvel of performance and effect utilizing the man against his environment/survival motif to justify visual and technical elegance and brilliance.|Fresh
You want to admire the technical achievement, except it never feels like a technical achievement. It just feels like you're there. And desperately want to leave.|Fresh
This masterpiece perfectly blends the elements of a science fiction blockbuster- A-list stars and amazing special effects- with a powerful and subtle story.|Fresh
Cuaron's knack for long takes amplifies the terror, where devastation approaches without a sound and that thump you hear could very well be your own pulse.|Fresh
It's a technical marvel -- appropriately breathtaking in its evocation of space's vastness and the buffeting suffered by the two astronauts in their efforts to anchor themselves to something solid. But Cuaron also knows how suspense works.|Fresh
Gravity is, in the end, a perfect melding of the technological and the emotional.|Fresh
An absolute technical marvel in every way possible -- from cinematography to special effects to sound design to score, all of Gravity's technical parts work together in perfect harmony for maximum effectiveness.|Fresh
Cuarn crucially knows how to deliver spectacle in a way that still counts -- and at a time when practically anything that can be imagined on the page can now be realised on screen, that's no mean feat.|Fresh
I was on the edge of my seat.|Fresh
Despite these flaws, Gravity is an amazing experience.|Fresh
Gravity asks that you think about these more lasting effects. And for that, and despite its distractions, its sad mother, its astronauts and ham radio connections, the movie is gorgeous and moving, more about possibility than credibility.|Fresh
A modern science-fiction classic that follows a fractured mother struggling to find herself in the vastness of space.|Fresh
Bullock's almost balletic performance imbues this vertiginous fantasy with a humanity and grace that beautifully complements director Alfonso Cuarn's breathtaking vision.|Fresh
"With Hollywood recycling and ""rebooting"" the same stories and sights more than ever, Gravity stands out as a spectacle not to be missed."|Fresh
That is probably one of the best acted, most visually stunning adventure films ever.|Fresh
Can one smell bull**** in space?|Rotten
Gravity resembles a cutting-edge video game more than it does a wholeheartedly immersive cinematic experience...|Fresh
Created through a painstaking combination of physical and digital performance that disintegrates the divide between live action and animation, Gravity boasts a level of sheer visual invention that would have left Stanley Kubrick's head spinning.|Fresh
Jaw-dropping wonder, dizzying vertigo, heart-stopping tension, spine-tingling shocks and visceral fear: Gravity stimulates them all... Bullock's vital signs [are] being monitored; that probably wouldn't be a bad idea for the viewer, too.|Fresh
The environment is entirely alien, the technology necessary to live in it has gone far beyond our ken, and humans float around haplessly waiting for the next systemic breakdown... It's hard not to identify with that set of circumstances.|Fresh
A nail-biting journey that's as nerve-wracking as it is technically impressive.|Fresh
The plot is one-track, the cast minimal and the pace leisurely. But it's a real pleasure to experience space in a movie without an alien in sight.|Fresh
One can easily imagine Robert Louis Stevenson or H Rider Haggard getting a kick out of Gravity.|Fresh
More like a 91-minute thrill-ride than an astronaut adventure movie, this tour de force throws us out into space without a safety line then thrills us with a series of near misses that take our breath away.|Fresh
Stunningly accomplished space survival adventure: heartstopping and heartbreaking; the best film of 2013 so far. Just don't call it science fiction.|Fresh
In space no one can hear you scream. No one can hear your jaw drop either.|Fresh
It's a bumpy trip, with two voyagers carrying, some will argue, excess charisma baggage. But it's a trip no space spectacle fan should miss.|Fresh
Gripping and utterly immersive space thriller with awe-inspiring visuals, state-of-the-art special effects, unmissable 3D work and a terrific central performance from Sandra Bullock.|Fresh
The film looks and feels so real you have to remind yourself virtually everything on screen doesn't actually exist.|Fresh
Everyone in for a unique cinematic ride against the backdrop of the abyss of outer space will have a fantastic time.|Fresh
Director and co-writer Cuarn brilliantly manages to create both awe at his glorious space vistas, and knuckle-gobbling tension at what's happening in the foreground.|Fresh
Finally the 3D film to knock your socks off. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarn's Gravity is a spectacular watch, which leaves you with a jaw dropping, head spinning, truly immersive space experience.|Fresh
The film of the year.|Fresh
a masterpiece of both action and psychology|Fresh
Like the title suggests, this is an astronaut adventure whose pull is hard to resist. By the time 90 stomach-shrinking minutes have elapsed, you'll feel like you've been bumped around the heavens.|Fresh
I would hate to make Gravity sound like nothing more than a technical achievement. The film does have a theme, and uses the marvels of its imagery to drive that meaning home.|Fresh
Keeps the tension at white-knuckle levels, evoking the paradoxically claustrophobic emptiness of space as the astronaut faces dangers intimate (asphyxiation) and existential (the void).|Fresh
Revolutionary in style and scope and one of the most audience-immersive films ever made.|Fresh
"""Gravity"" is a visual marvel, yet it's more than eye candy."|Fresh
A spectacular film that, for once, lives up to the hype|Fresh
The special effects are awesome while the storyline is just okay|Fresh
The stunning vista of the Earth spinning below, the scale of the emptiness, the distances, the astronauts and wreckage tumbling through the void...This is what 3D was made for.|Fresh
Less admirable than 2001, but more exciting|Fresh
Makes you feel as if you're floating through space|Fresh
Breathlessly paced with a procession of nerve-racking cliffhanger moment, Gravity is not just one of the best films about humans in space, it's one of the most tense tales about the power of the survival instinct.|Fresh
As a technical achievement, it's unparalleled...and its depiction of courage leaves a lasting impression. The little triumphs are always tempered by huge moments of melancholy and doubt, because there's always more harrowing danger just around the corner.|Fresh
Once the hype and hysteria descend from orbit, it'll be nice to have Gravity simply be what it is - an exciting, accomplished and flawed film from a director willing to take risks in the name of discovery.|Fresh
Much less than meets the eye. A victim once again of the professional critic's blurb machinery.|Rotten
While the movie is very heavy on special effects and dazzling visuals, the part of it that impressed me most was the very personal emotional journey of Stone (Bullock).|Fresh
Um filme que respeita a Cincia mesmo colocando-a totalmente a servio do Drama, revelando-se, no processo, como um dos melhores trabalhos de 2013.|Fresh
Isn't just a great movie, it's a great experience that frequently astonishes, captivates and embraces the challenge of raising the bar on what we should expect from modern day films.|Fresh
Blessed be the innovators but those interested in timelessness need to hire some writers and restore the basics to their rightful place in the cinematic firmament.|Fresh
In terms of old-fashioned, cliffhanger thrills, Gravity leads the pack this year. It plays like an extended version of the 'Open the pod-bay doors, HAL' sequence in Kubrick's '2001.'|Fresh
Totally glad I made the decision not to become an astronaut.|Fresh
The most exciting science-fiction space adventure ever made.|Fresh
Gravity is what cinema at its best should be - an experience that makes you grip the armrests tightly and slide to the edge of your seat as you become completely consumed by the story on the screen.|Fresh
"""Gravity"", a beautiful dance in space that is the closest replica anyone could ever ask for. Easily my favorite film of 2013."|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarn's film comes with a powerful force of its own - one which drags you towards the edge of your seat, forces your nails down into the cinema arm rests and sucks the breath out of you.|Fresh
By all means, see it. But if it actually does change your idea of cinema, you might want to see more movies.|Fresh
Once the lights fade and darkness envelops the theatre you're part of Stone's journey through the infinite.|Fresh
nothing if not a technical tour de force, possibly one of the greatest examples in recent years of how far cinematic technology can take us into experiences-both visceral and emotional-that most of us are unlikely to ever encounter|Fresh
Hugely moving and even, at times, terrifying, this is, without a doubt, the best mainstream American pic of the year thus far - gasp!|Fresh
Short But Engaging|Fresh
An eye-popping, digital/live-action marvel with new levels of sophistication in its groundbreaking special effects that leaves most other films looking like they're lagging light years behind.|Fresh
A minimalist masterpiece that more than merits the response it's gotten from the public and critics alike. How fitting, given its subject, that the acclaim has been universal.|Fresh
A triumph of nuance that imagines something from a source of simplicity and then wraps it in a cloak of wonderment, despair, alarm and sometimes outright horror.|Fresh
The clich 'edge of your seat' seems too mild for this exciting outer space thriller that combines technical magic with strong emotional pull.|Fresh
So many effects-heavy films promise to show you something you've never seen before. Gravity delivers.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarn makes it look effortless in Gravity, sculpting exemplary sound design, breathtaking images and 3D technology into a film that plunges the viewer straight to the heart of a sweat-inducing, pulse-racing nightmare scenario.|Fresh
A breathtakingly tense sci-fi thriller, a dazzling special-effects showcase that uses state-of-the-art technology to put us right in the spacesuits.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarn is among the world's finest, most versatile filmmakers, and someone who hasn't yet directed a dud. Gravity is quite OK too, but in the second tier of his work.|Rotten
A rendering of space in all its magisterial and exotic grandeur -- not only from what we've seen in footage and stills, but in the context of human presence, devastation, utter loneliness and salvation.|Fresh
Buckle up for a relentlessly-riveting, roller coaster ride through a deceptively-close outer space you can virtually reach out and touch!|Fresh
If I found a lamp, and a genie came out and granted me three wishes, I'd use one to raise Kubrick so I could take him to Gravity ... No element is out of place, no intention unrealized ... unity of time, place and character ... a work of the highest art.|Fresh
... the most spectacular and most accurate portrayal of how and why things work and fail in space... on IMAX and in 3D is finally and absolutely worth the price of admission.|Fresh
Perhaps the most remarkable thing is how the film makes the infinite vastness of outer space feel so intimate.|Fresh
visually beautiful and the science for the most part seems on the money right down to how the spacesuits move in a weightless environment.|Fresh
An elegant space film, with some of the best photography ever.|Fresh
An instant classic.|Fresh
To be frank, it's not Cuarn's best picture, not with Y Tu Mam Tambin and Children of Men on his resume. Yet what it lacks in sociopolitical heft and laser-point characterizations it makes up for in sheer visual spectacle.|Fresh
The closet I've ever been to being in space. There are times when you want to ask Sandra and George to move over because they and the so-so story are blocking the view.|Fresh
Director Cuaron may lack imagination in plot and character, but he excels in style.|Fresh
A magnificent thriller, and one of the most dumbfoundingly impressive technological feats in the 20 years since Jurassic Park put the world on notice about CGI.|Fresh
"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Gravity"" leaves the viewer with indelible memories that traverse between fantasy and nightmare flashbacks like an energizing pattern between positive and negative polarities."|Fresh
"Bullock and Clooney are good at playing themselves, but it felt like they ""phoned"" it in making the film feel shallow. Some nice visuals, but nothing that we haven't seen in far better Space films."|Rotten
Cuaron and his team have crafted a masterpiece that is so much more than it seems. All the pieces come together to form one of the most unforgettable movie-going experiences of recent memory.|Fresh
...a super-expensive thriller, at heart like many others, that I enjoyed reasonably well.|Fresh
Gravity has such a big screen scope, 3D clarity and gripping story that it'd be a crime to simply wait for Blu-ray to watch it.|Fresh
Cuaron thrusts us into the heavens for an adventure so lifelike you can almost reach out and touch the stars. And who wouldn't want to reach out and touch George Clooney and Sandra Bullock?|Fresh
"[The] director's last effort was another great science-fiction movie, ""Children of Men,"" which was borne of ideas. This one celebrates sensation. And it deserves to be one."|Fresh
A milestone in cinema. Ask me in twenty-five years about the most magical moviegoing excursions I've had, and I'm pretty sure I'll cite the day I saw Gravity as one of them.|Fresh
"""Gravity"" is a knock out, but without Bullock's movie-star charisma and everywoman relatability, the film wouldn't work nearly as well as it does."|Fresh
An intense visual wonder from Alfonso Cuaron with no extraneous BS. See it in 3-D if you can.|Fresh
Given what Cuarn has done here for the film medium, Gravity is nothing less than a 5-star 2001 Space Odyssey for a whole new generation of movie lovers. Take the ride.|Fresh
Let's just say seeing the film is the next best thing to the horror and beauty of being lost in space.|Fresh
Intense, astonishing sci-fi thriller has real soul.|Fresh
Gravity is 90 relentlessly frightening, unexpectedly moving minutes. It'll leave you shaking.|Fresh
Not since Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey has a mainstream film featured space exploration in such an evocative, heady, and realistic manner.|Fresh
Gravity doesn't travel any new ground with the space story. It just takes what has become standard and powers it into the cinema stratosphere with visuals that can't be fully appreciated in a single viewing and a story that is full of emotional fireworks.|Fresh
Cuaron's real victory in the film and his use of 3D is the way he lets it acquire an important role in the storytelling, because it allows the viewer to really get a sense of the unfathomable emptiness and isolation just above the clouds.|Fresh
Here is a movie that is everything a movie should be: relentlessly suspenseful and packed with cutting-edge effects while it's simultaneously filled with emotional gravity.|Fresh
An immersive masterwork -- a game-changer, both for the sci-fi genre and Hollywood filmmaking as a whole.|Fresh
The filmmakers put you out there with Ryan for 90 sweaty-palmed minutes.|Fresh
... a Worst-Space Scenario, in which everything that can go wrong does. It's basically 'Sandra Bullock and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Space Walk.'|Rotten
"Despite my few misgivings, I must admit that ""Gravity"" is an amazing experience."|Fresh
"""Gravity"" is an instant contender for Best Picture at the 2014 Academy Awards. And the buzz around Bullock as a possible Best Actress nominee is legitimate and well-founded."|Fresh
... with mind-boggling special effects, wonderful 3-D, and award-quality acting by Bullock, this is a movie not to be missed!|Fresh
A gonzo, gorgeous, brilliantly executed nightmare of a film.|Fresh
It's a movie that's not afraid to go deep or stare blankly at you to see if it can get you to blink first.|Fresh
This matter-of-fact thriller disdains sensationalism. Yet, the situations have you holding your breath as each new challenge or obstacle impedes the astronauts as they use their knowledge to find ways to stay alive.|Fresh
Combines a breathtaking use of 3D photography, terrifying action sequences and an emotionally gripping performance by Sandra Bullock to create a brilliant movie.|Fresh
Cuaron is as eager to invoke primal, instinctual fear as he is to indulge lyrical, philosophical reflection.|Fresh
This is a movie for movie theaters. This is a film that cannot be appreciated to its full extent off of the big screen. Gravity is why movie theaters exist.|Fresh
What immediately strikes you about 'Gravity' is how real everything looks. It's easy to think you're watching an IMAX documentary instead of Bullock and Clooney playing pretend.|Fresh
By taking the simple leap between a character's personal isolation and the equally terrifying physical isolation of space, Alfonso Cuaron creates a vertiginous masterpiece.|Fresh
An incredible, flawless, irresistible, white-knuckle, pound-your-head-against-the-wall-like-a-gorilla-smashing-coconuts exercise in technique.|Fresh
As an experience of pure cinema, an appreciation of its ability to show terrible and wonderful things, I can't think of its equal in 2013.|Fresh
As of right now, there's just nothing else like it. And that is a rare treat at the movies.|Fresh
Cuarn is so successful at immersing viewers in the astronauts' environment that Gravity is only marginally hampered by its flaws.|Fresh
A dazzling breakthrough for a director more gifted than even his many admirers may have suspected.|Fresh
Visually amazing, wonderfully suspenseful, and rooted in a place of humanity. A stellar popcorn movie.|Fresh
Doctoral theses will be penned on the breath-catchingly realistic, gorgeously choreographed, entirely mesmerizing opening ...|Fresh
At a scant 90 minutes, director Alfonso Cuarn's dramatic mystery/science-fiction/thriller will absolutely enthrall most viewers. I was riveted.|Fresh
"The most surprising and impressive thing about ""Gravity"" isn't its scale, its suspense, or its sense of wonder; it's that, in its heart, it is not primarily a film about astronauts, or space, or even a specific catastrophe."|Fresh
I like the movie's hopefulness, so against the grain of the end-of-everything scowling that we find in every other movie and TV show these days.|Fresh
"In the end ""Gravity"" has only the most basic things to say, but it says them so well and presents them so marvelously that it's a cinematic wonder."|Fresh
"""Gravity"" is one of the once-to-a-generation films that transform our sense of the immensity of space and the potential of film."|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarn and his son, Jons, have penned a fantastic yet credible story of courage, friendship, and survival. Even the title, 'Gravity,' is appropriate in its dual simplicity. (This) is a perfect movie. Seeing it in IMAX-3D is perfection plus.|Fresh
A gorgeous 90 minute long panic attack that caresses the soul while it obliterates the senses|Fresh
Gravity is the game-changing film of our generation. Cuaron has created a technical and emotional masterpiece that elevates the art form! See the film in IMAX 3D!|Fresh
Moves us closer to an art-house/blockbuster hybrid paradigm that could be Hollywood's salvation...a survivalist adventure that captures the primal terror of present death while exploring the will or won't to live.|Fresh
Gravity is a once in a generation film event.|Fresh
Get ready for a mind blowing, stomach churning, popcorn dropping space adventure that might be the most exciting movie you see all year.|Fresh
Cuaron has made a cinematic landmark that features mindblowing effects, relatable characters, and a career best performance from Sandra Bullock. GRAVITY is easily the best film of the year so far|Fresh
Cuaron has broken extraordinary ground here, creating a film-going immersion in outer space that, at least for those of us who've gotten no closer than an airplane allows, feels unfailingly right.|Fresh
Gravity is a celebration of the primal pleasure of movies.|Fresh
A viscerally exhilarating 91-minute thrill ride. It won't be remembered for its dialogue or characters, just for its game-changing sound and visual effects. Its style becomes its substance.|Fresh
If you can get past the heartstring-tugging, the amped up soundtrack, and George Clooney's relentless Clooneyness, this stunning space saga is the very reason we go to the movies.|Fresh
A true exercise in visual filmmaking and storytelling.|Fresh
This is one of the most stunning visual treats of the year and one of the most unforgettable thrill rides in recent memory.|Fresh
Spring for the IMAX 3D if you can, for the most immersive experience and the most realistic approximation of spaceflight this side of the moon.|Fresh
Like the movie itself, Bullock is brilliant, taking us inch by inch through Stone's alternating panic, despair, hope and hopelessness in the chaotic struggle to survive.|Fresh
The year's great cinematic visual achievement.|Fresh
An unforgettable experience.|Fresh
Prepare to return your jaw to its upright position.|Fresh
Gravity is magical, the kind of movie that will inspire a generation of kids to grab cameras and let their imaginations run wild, the proverbial face that launches a thousand ships.|Fresh
90 minutes of sheer excitement and terror, a dizzyingly participatory experience.|Fresh
It strives to bring cinema's past, especially the rip-roaring, edge-of-the-seat thrillers Hollywood used to make, into its technological, weightless, oxygen-free future.|Fresh
One of the most exhilarating experiences I've had in the cinema in recent memory.|Fresh
One of the most intense theater-going experiences I've had in years. It is more than just a great movie, it's a giant leap forward for the art of cinema.|Fresh
This enthralling tale of survival in space will open up young audiences' eyes to the excitement of out-of-this-world exploration -- and make older audiences remember the wonder they felt at 2001: A Space Odyssey.|Fresh
"As Cuarn spells out in his intro: ""Life in space is impossible"". So is forming any emotional attachment to Gravity."|Rotten
Gravity is the kind of enthralling, all-encompassing, giddy cinematic experience that surfaces once in a blue moon.|Fresh
Shockingly exciting.|Fresh
a cinematic spectacle without equal|Fresh
"""Gravity"" opens with a bravura sequence that is a genuine jaw-dropper. A game-changer. A paradigm of the sheer potency cutting-edge cinema can muster."|Fresh
The movie isn't perfect. But it provides a perfect moviegoing experience, and that's almost as good. The second time I went I watched a lot of the faces in the audience, and they looked just as I imagine mine did the first night I saw it: Whoa.|Fresh
It's a rare combination of jaw-dropping special effects and visual artistry, and it also works as slam-bang entertainment with just two actors and a swift running time of 90 minutes.|Fresh
An existential action movie that unashamedly embraces the sensation of awe.|Fresh
Words can do little to convey the visual astonishment this space opera creates. It is a film whose impact must be experienced in 3-D on a theatrical screen to be fully understood.|Fresh
A wildly suspenseful zero-g tale of survival 350 miles beyond the ozone layer, Alfonso Cuarn's space saga is emotionally jolting - and physically jolting, too.|Fresh
Yet Gravity also has an emotional and spiritual depth that, like 127 Hours, another film about man versus isolation, transcends what might at first seem a gimmicky plot device.|Fresh
That Gravity, in 2013, can make you wonder how it was made with almost every shot, is an incredible achievement. It manages to punch you in the nuts with reality and make you believe in magic all at the same time.|Fresh
"In one form or another, motion pictures have been with us since the middle of the 19th century, but there's never been one like ""Gravity."""|Fresh
"""Gravity"" must be seen in theaters to be appreciated; the prospect of watching this movie on anything less than a 40-foot screen is tantamount to listening to Beethoven through a tin can and a string."|Fresh
"Even as it looks to the heavens, ""Gravity"" is bound to earth, where the beauty is in the details."|Fresh
Gravity's great gift to the viewer is that it gives outer space back its beauty, terror, and wonder.|Fresh
Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey set the standard for films about space exploration. Until Now. But this one focuses on the human element and boy, are you in for a mind trip with Gravity. The cinematic achievement of the year.|Fresh
a real edge-of-your-seat thrill.|Fresh
Both a claustrophobic suspense thriller and a searing, emotional drama at the same time. And all along, it's absolutely gorgeous.|Fresh
Gravity... may actually be that rarest of beasts: An actual game-changer.|Fresh
A breathtaking film that's visually stunning, emotionally heart-wrenching, and has heart, soul, and even a bit of humor.|Fresh
Gravity into a thing of transcendent beauty and terror. It's more than a movie. It's some kind of miracle.|Fresh
This taut, austere, often wordless film explores the distinction between singularity and loneliness.|Fresh
You can't exactly call Alfonso Cuarn's Gravity the best film of its kind, because it has no kind: It stands alone as an extraordinary balance of 3-D effects, heroes-in-jeopardy storytelling and emotional depth.|Fresh
This is a film spectacular enough to demand the full IMAX 3-D treatment.|Fresh
Yes, director Alfonso Cuarn's Gravity is laden with ingenious special effects, but they make for a balletic visual experience that engulfs and transports the audience in a way that very few movies ever have.|Fresh
...a technical and emotional spectacle, creating a how-did-they-do-that illusion of weightlessness in all its beauty and peril.|Fresh
