We live in an anxious age of irony and increasing rancor, and if earnest antidotes seem too easy to dismiss, just try to resist Dina, a documentary about a middle-aged autistic couple. It may be the year's best documentary, and the best rom-com.|Fresh
Initially starting as a charming portrayal of American eccentrics, with a dose of Woody Allen-esque humour riddled by anxiety and neuroses, the film eventually grows more depth as it explores a topic rarely discussed in society.|Fresh
Dina looks like a Daniel Clowes graphic novel come to life, and its eccentric subjects would fit well as characters in Clowes' work.|Fresh
In addition to the great camerawork, I loved the filmmakers' dry, sardonic method of storytelling.|Fresh
Dina is a welcome feature to the autism canon that takes an observational approach, avoiding a forced narrative about the diagnosis.|Fresh
"Dina is a reminder that those of us who consider ourselves ""normal"" go through life in constant performance mode, play-acting our ideal version of ourselves from moment to moment."|Fresh
It's a rather remarkable feat.|Fresh
Romance, no matter what your mental capacity, is something beautiful. It's also a necessity for a woman like Dina, who has every reason to be mad at the world, yet soldiers on fueled by the unwavering belief that love conquers all.|Fresh
Overall, Dina is very well executed, though some audiences may find it a little too intimate for their own tastes.|Fresh

This gap is sometimes heartbreaking, occasionally funny and most often both.|Fresh
I liked Dina, the person, just fine. But I have real issues with the movie that bears her name.|Rotten
Dina is quite the character, such a non-stop talker she chatters through a dental procedure....The film, like its couple, is sweet and awkward, ending with hope for their future.|Fresh
Though their trip to the altar becomes a crowded and winning one, there are some intimate details which might have been better left unsaid.|Fresh
... the tableau-style presentation succeeds in embedding us with the film's subjects, letting viewers see the bond between Dina and Scott that, although sometimes brittle, stubbornly endures.|Fresh
Opinions will differ about the tact level of certain scenes, but overall this love story is valuable and touching.|Fresh
A diverting - if hardly life-changing - doc.|Fresh
Sickles and Santini excel at constructing a respectful (but never cold or clinical) distance from their subject, using long takes to let her explain herself in her own words.|Fresh
What emerges is a warm profile of two people who love each other, working a damned sight harder than many neurotypical couples to get over the humps in the road.|Fresh
Sickles and Santini's documentary is intimate, unvarnished and hugely touching, finding universal truths in its two subjects' unconventional romance.|Fresh

This modest, sensitively handled documentary becomes as compelling as any drama in this heartbreaking production.|Fresh
Powerful film-making, executed with subtle style.|Fresh
The off-center romance of Dina is enough to make you think that maybe there really is someone for everyone. There isn't, of course - it's among the biggest of the Big Lies - but it's reassuring to see that these nice folks are among the exceptions.|Fresh
The film is a fascinating look at love -- one that is not traditional but unarguably unconditional.|Fresh
It is a beautifully shot, coolly composed movie, in which the principals emerge as intensely likable and intelligent.|Fresh
A poignant snapshot of marginalised lives.|Fresh
[Antonio] Santini and [Dan] Sickles make us care deeply for Dina and Scott, so close is their access.|Fresh
It's rare for filmmakers to get so close to any couple, but a special sort of caution comes with watching the lives of people whose view of the world might be far from our own.|Fresh
The film slowly wins your heart as it explores the complexity of a relationship with problems that have no easy solutions.|Fresh
From the mundane to the eventful, the movie takes a fairly unflinching, yet respectful view of Dina and Scott's world, which includes family, friends, hobbies, home life, trips, rituals and old Top 40 songs.|Fresh
[An] affectionate and uncommonly intimate portrait of two people on the autism spectrum in a romantic relationship.|Fresh
... manages to balance sympathy for their situation without resorting to cheap sentiment, even if the approach lacks true objectivity.|Fresh
The film is mostly happy to stay in its sweetly mundane lane, but not without keeping a couple dramatic and moving bumps waiting down the road.|Fresh
"The documentary form has answered the call and offered up one of the most surprising and thoughtful romantic comedies of the year in ""Dina."""|Fresh
There are some extremely dark moments in Dina, and these are even more powerful because of Santini and Sickles' humanistic approach. Their care for Dina and Scott is clear in every frame.|Fresh
What redeems Dina is the fullness of the woman herself, who's managed her disability and survived a mortal threat in order to open up to the possibility of a long-term relationship.|Fresh
They are a sweet couple whom you want to root for, and their conditions and circumstances have imbued them with personalities that some might perceive as quirky.|Fresh
We come to understand that the camera's distance from its subjects as an act of respect that allows the complex, funny, and indomitable personalities to shine through.|Fresh
It's impossible not to care deeply about these anxious lovebirds, especially as we begin to understand the obstacles threatening their relationship.|Fresh
That the movie is so funny without ever being funny at these people's expense is something very special indeed.|Fresh
A tender love story, Dina is a documentary that could easily be mistaken for a fiction film.|Fresh
The rapport between the filmmakers and their principal characters is so comfortable, it occasionally feels as if we are watching a scripted film .|Fresh
Perhaps the most beautiful romance at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival plays out in Dina, a documentary as warm-hearted and as open as its title character.|Fresh
Alternately comic and tragic and best when its both at once, Dina humanizes a world of people who were only dehumanized because we allowed them to be.|Fresh
A sensitive snapshot of two ordinary people on the autism spectrum who are determined to carve out a meaningful future together.|Fresh
Directors Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles never condescend to or coddle their vivacious leading lady, and the result is a fascinating love story.|Fresh
