The film's tastefully constricted aesthetic is enjoyably at odds with its unruly, philosophical themes; the slipperiness of a dual identity, the fragility of war and the relentless manner in which grief can leak into a home's every crevice.|Fresh
Foxtrot is a cinematic delight with a profound message at its heart and many striking shots that resonate long after the final credits roll.|Fresh
Hellerian surrealism. Slapstick comedy. There are many tones and textures set against two backdrops in Samuel Maoz's long-awaited follow-up to Lebanon.|Fresh
Maoz definitely knows how to knock a film together, so fingers crossed that the window between this and his next one is a lot more narrow.|Fresh
Foxtrot excels at showing the tedium and dehumanizing effects of military deployment.|Fresh
A beautifully shot and ambitiously crafted film about the absurdities of life in Israel.|Fresh
Maoz's writing is matched every step of the way by his direction, and Foxtrot is a properly visionary work.|Fresh
Maoz creates a deadpan J'accuse, razor-edged and hugely original. The truth? It is unmissable.|Fresh
Before the retrospective letdown, there is an exhilarating kind of disorientation as we move from one narrative section to the next.|Fresh
Maoz's masterful, intelligent feature shows how war can challenge a decent family unit, while hollow rhetoric destroys its spirit. A salutary film that eschews gimmickry or empty sloganeering, Foxtrot deserves to be seen.|Fresh

As subjected as they all are to the vagaries of a fickle and bitterly ironic universe, Maoz always gives voice to the cries of his characters.|Fresh
Maoz has made a film with many moments of heart-breaking brilliance, but he also makes the plot veer in so many different directions until it eventually spins out of control.|Rotten
"Few films go to the places that ""Foxtrot"" goes. It's a wholly unique experience that excels on multiple dramatic and filmmaking levels."|Fresh
It's beautiful and haunting with unexpected twists and turns right up until the final shot. It's an early contender as one of 2018's best films.|Fresh
Along with the tragic absurdity of everyday life, it reveals the inherited mental scars of Auschwitz that Israeli families still bear, bubbling beneath the surface|Fresh
If Lebanon was fueled by its visceral intensity, Foxtrot could use a little less of the same - the one moment it seems totally alive is when a character breaks rank to perform an impassioned dance number.|Rotten
Inventive, immersive and absorbing from start to finish, and so accurate in its portrayal of loss that the story feels as though it has been ripped from reality.|Fresh
It's become a political movie regardless of his intent, yet it's more interested in people than wars that go on and on.|Fresh
Divided into three unequal sections, the film has a powerful message about life in contemporary Israel, a message some will find confronting.|Fresh
It is an anti-war movie, but not in the usual form we are accustomed to. It is a pro-people movie, the type of which we could use more.|Fresh
Unsettling, occasionally shocking but always fascinating, Foxtrot is one of those films that demands to be seen and remembered.|Fresh
It's an extraordinary film, far from easy, ultimately thoughtful and hard to forget.|Fresh
The twists and reversals in Maoz's screenplay are bold enough to alienate or even anger. But his cast and crew are all on the same page, in on the same joke, and the strange engine hums.|Fresh
Astonishes with its ability to thrive on serious tonal shifts, flash-forwards and a bit of animation... Samuel Maoz demonstrates a depth of feeling and a sense of bitter absurdity.|Fresh
The film's bold structure keeps the audience on its toes.|Fresh
Samuel Maoz's Foxtrot toys with our emotions, but that doesn't mean it lacks any of its own. This is an energetic and structurally audacious jukebox of sensations, prioritising impulse over precision and thought over action.|Fresh
The film is a masterpiece.|Fresh
"Continuous conflict consumes all and everyone in its wake in this intense telling from the same filmmaker who gave us the powerful ""Lebanon."""|Fresh
[The] powerful portrait of grief gives way to an ecstatic and absurdist midsection that follows Jonathan during his military service at a lonely desert roadblock, and there are still a couple more wallop-packing twists to come.|Fresh
On one level it is bleak and full of despair and on another, it pulses with magic realism and a sardonic humor that is critical of the state of affairs in Israel today.|Fresh
With its unflinching and painstaking execution of such grim subject matter, Foxtrot is certainly not an easy watch, but an ultimately rewarding one.|Fresh
This Israeli import, written and directed by Samuel Maoz, is weighted down by grief and tragedy, as it delves into the uncertainties and ironies of life in modern-day Israel for military personnel and civilians alike.|Fresh
"A meditation on war, duty, family, PTSD, and Israeli identity, which is much more interested in telling a compelling character story than scoring political or ideological points."" (Broad Street Review)"|Fresh
With caustic wit and fantastic performances for all involved, the film is destined to be an anti-war classic. War, war never changes.|Fresh
Maoz does an impeccable job of fashioning a non-linear narrative that reveals just enough to keep us guessing, but not enough to ever feel confident about our guesses.|Fresh
Filmmaker Samuel Moaz keeps his film at a tilt, with flashbacks and forwards playing havoc with the timeline, keeping the audience alert and wondering.|Fresh
It metaphorically illustrates the pointlessness of expelling energy and resources on an activity going nowhere, much like Israel's many wars with its Arab neighbors - and within generations of its own society.|Fresh
And the performances! Watch the world crumble and emotions ripple and rumble across Ashkenazi's features. To live is to suffer. To love is to suffer. Grief transforms: Foxtrot electrifies.|Fresh
Maoz is a director of gallows humor and creamy visual control, and the movie at times dances along the edge of magical realism only to pull the characters and the audience back with a jolt.|Fresh
It's a rigorous, fascinating deep dive into the immediate, numbed aftermath of sudden loss, injected with very dry comedy as the military reps try to be helpful.|Fresh
The film's effect is so powerful, its timeless themes so beautifully dramatized: War is hell and senseless but inevitable; love is what binds us together and rips us apart; life is a series of accidents-both awful and joyous-waiting to happen.|Fresh
After as painful an opening as any film you'll see, Foxtrot director Samuel Maoz divides his film into three acts... an approach that sometimes makes Foxtrot feel overly studied but which also tends to intensify each agonizing moment.|Fresh
"Samuel Moaz has crafted a fine narrative that intimately examines grief in minute detail. The tedious nature of the approach may frustrate impatient viewers, but the excellent cinematography by Giora Bejach (""Big Bad Wolves"") is a feast for the eyes."|Fresh
Somehow, a casually traveling camel or soldiers breaking out and doing the foxtrot dance are just memorable moments instead of defining moments of the film. Every shot and conversation has something important to say|Fresh
Foxtrot plays like a chamber drama with an absurd penchant for tragedy.|Fresh
So much of Foxtrot feels like a dangling thread - a cruel jest of fate without meaning. Yet, thanks to the restrained performance from Ashkenazi, who lets discomfort crackle across his stoic features like breaking glass, we can feel the endless conflict.|Fresh
The last third is still well-acted and -written, with interesting visual echoes throughout. But its concerns appear somewhat pedestrian compared with the strange dance that began when their doorbell rang.|Fresh
The results are stunning. Foxtrot takes us from unfathomable mourning to soul-numbing tedium and back again.|Fresh
A complex, challenging film that uses a singular tragedy to illuminate the dark implications of Israeli policy in the occupied territories, for both sides.|Fresh
"Most everything ... in ""Foxtrot"" feeds into a singular, aching illustration of fate at its cruelest."|Fresh
A slippery thing that resists easy categorization, and will reward viewers who wait until all of its secrets have been revealed.|Fresh
Foxtrot is recommended.|Fresh
There are no grand statements about death or grief here, only minute observations of their effects, presented through carefully-considered performances and filmmaking decisions.|Fresh
Moaz gives us information with no grounding, then contextualizes it after the fact, the device working to add layers of meaning as well as deliver one gut punch of an ending.|Fresh
Foxtrot resembles a dream, and one that carries you along with it. The themes-grief, guilt, regret-are hard to miss, and the final shot is a devastating gut punch that explains some question marks that come before it.|Fresh
Maoz's approach is masterly, his camera unerringly choosing either gloomy close-ups or wryly funny wider angles.|Fresh
...a decent premise that's employed to consistently uninvolving effect by Maoz...|Rotten
It is both delicate allegory and dark indictment.|Fresh
Samuel Moaz's brutal, three-act Foxtrot even manages to be a darker military comedy than Talya Lavie's Zero Motivation, and that's saying a lot.|Fresh
"The film is less an indictment than a diagnosis of a collective pathology: Israel's cycle of violence and grief is an obsessive-compulsive dance, the ""foxtrot"" of the title, where you advance and retreat and end up exactly where you started."|Fresh
Foxtrot is a minor masterpiece that audiences will remember for a long time, thanks to the masterful script and some dazzling acting.|Fresh
This is a movie that invites but ultimately transcends analysis, delivering its final, poignant emotional punch directly to the soul.|Fresh
A surreal, dreamlike drama.|Fresh
With a fluent mix of irony and sincerity, Maoz interrogates - gently, but with unwavering insistence - the rituals of a country mired in the moral contradictions of occupation and its own defensive crouch.|Fresh
Maoz constructs the film as an elaborate puzzle with pieces that come together in the end. But its power emerges from the terrific performances, especially by Ashkenazi as a tortured soul who seems to trust no one.|Fresh
"Israeli filmmaker Samuel Maoz's strange, engaging ""Foxtrot"" offsets tragedy with a significant entertainment factor."|Fresh
... invites viewers to draw their own conclusions in what adds up to a haunting experience.|Fresh
Maoz brilliantly toes the line between black comedy and drama.|Fresh
Foxtrot comes together as a complex plea for honesty, openness, frankness, and forgiveness. The movie is also, incidentally, a spectacularly effective antiwar film...|Fresh
... we are definitely before the work of a perfectionist filmmaker, with an overwhelming effect for the analytical viewer. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Foxtrot is an exercise in narrative virtuosity, that observes extreme situations with steely eyes. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
...a complex discourse on the tenuous line that separates salvation from condemnation. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Foxtrot"" leads us a sorry dance, with irreproachable skill, but sometimes you long for it to break step, to quicken, and to breathe."|Rotten
Brings satirical tradition of Catch-22 to the Israeli Defense Forces...Some irony may be lost on foreign audience...but U.S. will appreciate caustic theater of the absurd.|Fresh
Exquisitely crafted and controlled, Foxtrot is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking, beautifully framed and astutely observant.|Fresh
It captures a sense of ennui that's a familiar presence in Israeli cinema about the military, a sense of a mission lost in a morass, and shades it with a touch of surrealism and a great sweeping dose of tragedy.|Fresh
Some of its stylistic flights are self-indulgent, or at least inessential, though none is uninteresting.|Fresh
The political statements are kept at a minimum here, in favor of artful resonance to story and character.|Fresh
Samuel Moaz's Israeli drama about life, war and grief Is a deeply resonant achievement that takes a piece out of you.|Fresh
"Watching the Israeli film ""Foxtrot "" is like watching a dream play out."|Fresh
An anxiety-inducing meditation on of the loss of a child.|Fresh
It's a superior piece of cinema.|Fresh
Surreal imagery and unrelenting sorrow make for a powerful combination, with Foxtrot hitting on some intense emotional truths about the enduring cost of war.|Fresh
The undeniable power of the staging tends to eclipse the strength of the drama. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
... Foxtrot tries to offer a fierce criticism both of the uses and abuses of the Israeli army and of the absurdity of military life. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...a movie that wants to play with the expectations of the viewer, but without irretrievably dispersing. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
No scene unfolds in a straight line, and Ashkenazi carries so much inner tension that even in repose he seems in furious motion - cognitively foxtrotting, if you will.|Fresh
The performances are superlative: subtle, rumbled, with the sense between husband and wife of a lifetime of love and disappointment.|Fresh
The film undermines its own drama by waiting until the final seconds to inform the audience of what we're supposed to have spent the last 110 minutes caring about.|Rotten
Icy absurdism and sorrowful ironies abound throughout Samuel Maoz's Foxtrot, whose laughs stick in your throat like the silent screams of its Job-like protagonist.|Fresh
Samuel Maoz's moody movie, his third, leaves you guessing its intentions scene by scene, but by the end you're faced with a carefully etched portrayal of an absurd society eating itself alive.|Fresh
Foxtrot is a smart film, worth the initial onslaught of grief for the puzzle of uncovering the film's hidden messages. God bless filmmakers who trust their audience to be smart enough to figure things out without explicit expository dialogue.|Fresh
A film about the terrible cost of the occupation for both peoples, and about the corrosive, self-defeating norms of Israeli manhood, Foxtrot is as impressive a movie as I've seen in months.|Fresh
This is very much a universal story. And one shot with grace, confidence, humor and a visual flair that even makes cans of potted meat look beautiful.|Fresh
A complex picture of a nation seemingly as much at war with itself as it is with others. Foxtrot's an entertainment that decimates the capability to stereotype a whole people.|Fresh
Heavy with horror though it may be, Foxtrot turns out to be too conceptually and stylistically audacious to be called a slog; it keeps throwing curveballs, some crueler than others.|Fresh
Samuel Maoz's philosophical black comedy is a triptych of surrealism laced with insights about warfare and grief that are both timeless and timely.|Fresh
Writer-director Samuel Maoz pulls some narrative sleight-of-hand that may feel like cheating to some, but it also builds a powerful case against numb acceptance of war's brutal stupidity.|Fresh
A formally gorgeous piece of work, the kind of film that exudes confidence in structure and tone, and it contains some of the most striking, memorable imagery of the year.|Fresh
It would be simple to call Foxtrot cynical, but it's too achingly understanding ... for that to be the case.|Fresh
The combination of straightforward realism, deadpan surrealism, historical horror and domestic tragedy is harrowingly impactful. It's as if Maoz realized that a single, sustained tone couldn't possibly do justice to the vastness of the subject.|Fresh
A movie that builds into a devastating indictment of a nation, shock by shock, brutal moment by brutal moment.|Fresh
"No matter what you're expecting, ""Foxtrot"" is not the film you expect it to be. It's better."|Fresh
[A] bruisingly powerful movie ...|Fresh
Foxtrot gives grief an added complexity. It's not just grieving a loss that's out of your control, it's a grief created by circumstances established long ago, but that can't seem to be changed no matter how many people are suffering.|Fresh
Mingles realism and the surreal to convey the immorality of war.|Fresh
Israel's Oscar entry is suffused with melancholy and guilt|Fresh
Lacerating allegory of grief, guilt and occupation|Fresh
Foxtrot has a wonderful script that unfortunately suffers from an exaggerated plot twist... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Foxtrot is a unclassifiable blend of black comedy, surrealism and socio-political drama that proves to be equal parts unflinching and unforgettable.|Fresh
It's a film that can swing between absurdist humor and brutal gut-punch sadness, in a way that's rare and, at times, truly profound.|Fresh
While Foxtrot plays as something of a comedy of errors, it also makes some biting political points.|Fresh
Bold and ambitious.|Fresh
A brilliant movie, one that is so rich thematically, visually, musically and emotionally, that one viewing is not enough to begin to absorb all it has to offer.|Fresh
... Foxtrot never steps into the second-feature trap, but proves once more that the Lebanon director is a force to be reckoned with, at any age.|Fresh
The film tackles grief in a way so raw that it almost burns, with wrenching moments of both quiet and rage that simply astound.|Fresh
As the full story of Jonathan's demise finally takes shape, it transpires that Maoz has kept a final, bitterly cruel trick up his sleeves.|Fresh
Despite the slower pace and unusual shooting style, Foxtrot is a fascinating look at the grieving process, a topic we might otherwise dance around instead.|Fresh
Thoughtful, melodic, and devastating.|Fresh
Foxtrot is a bold and imaginative portrait of the confines of family.|Fresh
[Director Samuel] Maoz compliments his unpredictable narrative with sharp, meticulous framing in every scene.|Fresh
It is a fierce, urgent, unflinching picture.|Fresh
Brilliantly constructed with a visual audacity that serves the subject rather than the other way around, this is award-winning filmmaking on a fearless level.|Fresh
Though it is all about mourning and loss, Maoz' script reaches way beyond, unveiling in each one of his leading characters deep layers of past guilt that might have never been revealed in normal circumstances.|Fresh
Bold modernist cinema at its most harrowing.|Fresh
