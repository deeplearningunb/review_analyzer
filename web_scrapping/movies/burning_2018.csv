A searing, cryptic, and grimly beautiful postmodern mystery about fleeting relationships in the 21st century.|Fresh
Burning...refers to the resentment and the anger felt by the young and struggling towards the rich and overbearing. Revelations like these hover just beneath the surface of this beautifully directed mystery.|Fresh
...there's still an awful lot here to enjoy, from the expertly subdued playing to the location work and cinematography to a nasty yet elusive sense of humour.|Fresh
Burning is a film about the seen and the unseen; a film of small details, some of them obvious plot devices, others so subtle they could be easily missed.|Fresh
Lee hypnotises with his story of a love triangle, crafting a movie that could be described as visual poetry.|Fresh
The subtext is pointedly political but always expressed through Lee's subtle cinematic intensity, with evocative views of murky interiors and landscapes that dissolve into dusk and darkness.|Fresh
This is the kind of film that all but demands a second viewing in order to appreciate the complex elegance of the design, assembled from details systematically calculated to lend themselves to more than one interpretation.|Fresh
The flight path taken by this ingeniously involving psychological drama from South Korea glides to such dizzying altitudes across its (very lengthy) running time that it almost does not matter when it runs out of narrative runway upon landing. Almost.|Fresh
Mesmerising, threatening and beautiful ... You'll feel a strong sense of neo-noir at work, tugging against, or alongside, a neorealist examination of class divide. There's a lot going on, and the film takes its time, but it's exceptionally satisfying.|Fresh
It is an ambiguous story but in terms of character building and suspense it sears itself into our minds and refuses to let go.|Fresh

Slow, enigmatic character study with nudity, violence.|Fresh
My hot take? It left me a bit cold.|Rotten
Lee Chang-dong's film offers questions rather than answers because it's main feeling is the omnipresence of the unprecedented. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
By removing the concrete and focusing on the inherent potential of the displayed moment, the whole of Burning transforms from a quiet character-driven piece into a philosophical maelstrom.|Fresh
It's a slow ... burn (haha), but I guess the ending was satisfying. Maybe?|Fresh
"When Jong-su states, late in the movie, that ""the world is a mystery"", he may as well be speaking for the audience - even after they leave the cinema."|Fresh
In a toxic new world, the only survivors are those with pacts with the devil.|Fresh
Wave your lighters in the air. This bleak movie is one of the year's best.|Fresh
It is interesting and it looks good but it is not involving enough to sustain its 148-minute run time and despite its unusual storytelling the ending proved strangely predictable.|Rotten
There is perhaps a tiny bit of pretentiousness in Lee's approach, but he knows how to fascinate viewers with resonant, tantalising scenes.|Fresh
[Burning] could last eight hours and it would still be compelling, a dark, devastating mystery that offers up so many subtle clues that it's hard not to turn to your neighbour and start whispering theories.|Fresh
If alienation and cruelty among South Korea's millennials are conditions of sociopolitical malaise on the East Asian peninsula, then Burning is a stunningly acted and directed expression of it.|Fresh
It's chilling and brilliant.|Fresh
Playing against genre expectations and a slow pace will definitely turn off some viewers, but Burning rewards patient audience members with an enigmatic and eerie psychological character drama.|Fresh
Burning casts such a strange spell.|Fresh
A twisted love triangle at the core of this Korean thriller...becomes something far more unsettling thanks to a bracing midway plot jolt and a powerful atmosphere of doom and dread created by the director Lee Chang-dong.|Fresh
This is a landmark film, stunning in execution and engrossing in its narrative. A trio of excellent performances give the film a magnetic quality under the assured hand of Lee Chang-dong. Destined to be one of the films of the year.|Fresh
Combining the unruffled quotidian spell of Hou Hsiao Hsien's dramas with the pertinent observation of Jia Zhangke's contemporary themes, this film burns slowly ...|Fresh
Director Lee Chang-dong has complete mastery of the tone here and he gets great, subtle performances from his cast.|Fresh
Burning is a sophisticated, deliciously opaque thriller, wrought through gifted cinematography, depicting the Korean countryside with a sense of atmosphere and, in one memorable scene, capturing a spectacular sunset.|Fresh
Burning is primarily about the novelistic imagination, but Jongsu's story also coalesces the mood of uncertainty that has been visible in the Korean left during the ultra-rightwing presidencies of Lee Myungbak and Park Geunhye.|Fresh
Oh hey it's The Nice Guy's Complaint done up arthouse style, meant to render male entitlement, unwarranted sexual jealousy, and personal ineffectualness as something deep and meaningful. It's not.|Rotten
I like haywire. And Burning, in its sombrely burnished way, is very haywire.|Fresh
So much ambiguous detail to ponder, while the visual design insidiously marks your memory.|Fresh
A vibrant, visceral experience.|Fresh
Slow and difficult to get a hold on, Burning emerges as a brilliantly made one-off; puzzling, intelligent and ultimately mesmerising. And Jong-seo Jun is a revelation.|Fresh
Burning is a film in which to lose oneself.|Fresh
Going deep into the well|Fresh
It's the type of movie that demands immediate discussion afterward.|Fresh
Repeat viewings are recommended -- nay, required -- to sift through the film's secrets.|Fresh
It's the rare symbiotic triumph between singular source material and singular cinematic vision.|Fresh
The building anxiety of the second half of the movie... gets down deep into your bones.|Fresh
Austere, brilliantly acted, and punctuated with flashes of genius...one's appreciation for Burning will depend on one's patience for tedium.|Fresh
What's exceptional about Burning is clear right from the start. A kind of meandering, daylit noir that is as invested as any of the best of the genre in the most buried parts of our psychology...|Fresh
"Before you know it, ""Burning"" will have you in a trance, playing like a quiet fever dream you won't want to shake."|Fresh
A meticulous assessment of first love, and the agonizing burst of feelings that springs forth from it.|Fresh
Burning raises actual questions about money and its effects on people's lives.|Fresh
It offers a taut and thrilling mystery that you will be talking about for days.|Fresh
"Director Chang-dong Lee's ""Burning""; a scintillating masterwork of class warfare, contemporary existential pressures and an agonising pursuit for truth in the haze of manipulated perception; contains a single staggering scene."|Fresh
Burning takes the form of a potboiler with something more disturbing and lingering simmering underneath.|Fresh
This aptly titled beauty never offers easy answers, but a sparkling young trio, as mesmerizing as any that Hollywood might assemble, keeps you looking for them anyway.|Fresh
With a gripping performance by Yoo, which goes from smoldering to raging with subtle mastery, Lee serves up a psychological thriller that's deliciously dark and packs a wallop in the final reel.|Fresh
Burning is more interested in exploring ennui and desperation in the abstract than offering distinct answers about its characters, and it's all the more riveting because of it.|Fresh
There's a meta-narrative aspect wherein the film's characters are characters in life-symbols poked and prodded in some grand experiment to find humanity's breaking point.|Fresh
Burning invites us to question everything that we're seeing, a process that's aided by its cast of fine young actors.|Fresh
Burning endlessly suggests questions without determining answers, and no film this year has so potently evoked the spirit of our slippery, maddening modern moment.|Fresh
The shifts are so subtle that the plot gets ahead of us before we realize the changes ... but that's because we're so caught up in the ways that Jong-su's thinking evolves...|Fresh
One of the greatest beauties of Burning - aside from the beautiful photography of cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo - is that its story beats are almost all implied.|Fresh
Lee's film is true to the elusive character of his source material... but all such description of the movie fades in the face of its generous welter of poetry, of onrushing light and shadow and confusion and stark, staring beauty.|Fresh
Burning will bore the hell out of you for a long time, but never enough to lose interest or tap out, before catching you in an anaconda vice; what was once boring becomes an unforgettable work of genius deserving to be repeatedly examined|Fresh
...a mysterious character study that grows into a somber, generational portrait.|Fresh
A potent metaphysical thriller.|Fresh
A melancholy look at how we imagine ourselves in the world, and all the ways that class, family and desire can come to complicate that.|Fresh
Burning is an intriguing dramatic mystery that rarely bequeaths answers, usurping the male gaze and dichotomy between the well-meaning creep and madman.|Fresh
A slow burn of a film, Burning isn't only painfully long but it is seriously problematic in treating women like a sexual fantasy.|Rotten
It's a total mindf--k that twists you in all sorts of knots. And just when you think you've got it figured out -- BAM! -- you don't.|Fresh
"The mysterious, entrancing ""Burning""... is like a weird dream you'll want to try and remember after waking up."|Fresh
Location is everything: As Alienated Young Man dramas go, Lee Chang-dong's Burning might not work quite as well as it does if not for where much of it is set. It's also a meditation on perception, spiritual longing, and the nature of reality.|Fresh
Burning is a stylish, unsettling reminder that love can be a gateway to emotions more unpredictable than mere carnal desire.|Fresh
Although nothing is explicitly surreal, there are enough off-kilter intrusions to cast the everyday in an odd light, where the inexplicable opens a story to unseen possibilities.|Fresh
With Lee's exacting eye, the off-kilter tone and top-notch performances by an attractive young cast, it's not a waste of time.|Fresh
Burning gently works its way into our psyche, hiding significance behind the intricacies of the central riddle|Fresh
A deeply affecting story with universal resonance about loss and longing and defined by director Lee Chang-dong's unique point of view.|Fresh
For a film that tires so hard to subvert standard methods of storytelling, the action that climaxes the film comes as a cheat, a commercial concession of the lowest order.|Rotten
The haunting film's elegant mysteries keep unfolding after the last ashes are swept away.|Fresh
Lee plays the actors off one another to create a compelling exploration of human nature.|Fresh
Not only does Burning subvert the expectations of pacing and storytelling when it comes to the genre, Lee also takes pride in padding out his characters, deeply diving into their psyches and letting the audience immerse themselves into their oddball lives|Fresh
Since the film never force-feeds the audience, its conclusions are all the more alarming and inevitable.|Fresh
Burning causes an uncompromising sense of uncertainty in the viewer... Like a great magic trick, the film remains elusive and mysterious even after the grand reveal.|Fresh
A slow-burn masterful adaptation by South Korean writer-director Chang-dong Lee.|Fresh
Burning is a masterpiece because it's about Kierkegaardian fear and trembling and it comes to the same conclusions.|Fresh
The film stays and stays, as you review its subtleties and decide it needs to be seen again. The score is topnotch. At Lightbox.|Fresh
Powerfully enigmatic and immaculately constructed.|Fresh
"Do not expect substantive answers to the questions that ""Burning"" raises in your mind. But, for two hours you lose yourself in the mystery tale."|Fresh
"a real breakthrough for Yeun, who in one monologue bears eerie resemblance to Joseph Cotten in ""Shadow of a Doubt."""|Fresh
How far would you descend into madness for love? How much farther for hatred? How much farther will we fall until we can fall no longer? How much dirt and blood can you be stained with before it never washes off.|Fresh
Burning is as ephemeral as a puff of smoke, and you can imagine just about anything in its gaseous curls.|Fresh
"""Burning"" keeps reminding us how little we can be sure of. Its mysteries extend through character, plot and the essence of fiction to the real world as we think we know it."|Fresh
A haunting and beguiling example of Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong's mastery of character and mood, Burning is one of the best and most transfixing cinematic experiences of the year.|Fresh
A movie of shadows and light that gets at populist rage by way of incendiary metaphor.|Fresh
Patiently introduces you to its characters until they become real to you, then slowly leads you to their grueling fate.|Fresh
Sure to land on many best-of lists for 2018, Lee Chang-dong's gripping thriller manages to unpack genuine suspense alongside sharp social critique.|Fresh
This is despairing filmmaking, but also the kind that arrests the eye from its first moments.|Fresh
Burning is a quiet, contemplative film that wields its deliberate pace like a surgeon's scalpel.|Fresh
This is a soulful, hypnotic drama about a young man who obsessively seeks answers but has no way of grasping that kind of control over his own narrative. It's also one of the year's very best films.|Fresh
Achieving a style much more poetic and eloquent than that evidenced by Murakami in his best sellers, the director raises a debate about love and death dealt with great elegance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Adapted from a short story by by Haruki Murakami, Burning is a haunting and poetic mystery about class, loneliness, alienation and memory.|Fresh
Lee's adaptation is at once elastically free, with many details changed, and loyal to Murakami's blend of the perplexing and the crystalline.|Fresh
A discursive, unsettling movie that is all the more so for being essentially undefinable.|Fresh
The stylish film is deliberately paced yet rewards patience with some clever and deeply felt twists to keep moviegoers guessing.|Fresh
The ending is unsatisfying by design, but unsatisfying on another level, too-for here is a wonderfully well-wrought movie that lacks nothing but the essential, nothing but the scorch of flame.|Fresh
Burning is as smart as cinema gets.|Fresh
Burning,... sways with a mysterious heartache. It's ostensibly a psychological thriller, loosely adapted from a 1992 short story by Haruki Murakami, but every plot turn burns with an existential sorrow.|Fresh
Yoo is superbly hapless as Jongsu, offering a hang-dog performance as a guy who's unsure about just about everything in his life.|Fresh
[Lee Chang-dong] wins three performances that, in a fairer world, would all be up for big awards.|Fresh
It's a pity that a work so precisely constructed as Burning too often devolves into yet another male-insecurity movie...dwelling intently on male pathology at the level of character psychology and signposting its connections to the problems of the day.|Rotten
A great film, engrossing, suspenseful, and strange.|Fresh
It's haunting stuff, as fascinating as it is difficult to shake.|Fresh
Burning takes its pulpy mid-point turn without surrendering the sense of ambiguity and ambivalence it evinced in its opening scenes.|Fresh
Jealousy, class divisions, sex, arson, and spying all work their way into Lee Chang-Dong's Burning, a terrific new thriller that seizes the anxieties of our present extraordinarily well, forging from them the meat of our entrenched, existential troubles.|Fresh
All three leads are sensational (Yeun turns yawns and soft laughter into nightmares), giving performances that retain a sense of mystery that dovetails with the movie's ambiguity.|Fresh
It's a movie about men who simmer with anxiety, resentment, and creative desire, and how those feelings can boil over in unexpected and horrifying ways.|Fresh
It's unsettlingly tense for much of its runtime, but its greatest accomplishment is its portrait of youthful alienation, and what can happen when individuals are unable to ever connect.|Fresh
The director, aside from telling a fascinating story on its own merit, articulates an eloquent portrait of South Korea. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Is it a love triangle, a murder mystery or a comment on the human condition? Whatever you call this stunning, slow-build thriller from South Korean director Lee Chang-dong, it sizzles with a cumulative power that will knock the wind out of you.|Fresh
Forces you to shift your focus, allegiance, and expectations with the simplest of camera moves or moments from its actors. Lee keeps this tale spinning so smoothly that you don't even notice that the movie has been playing you.|Fresh
Lee Chang-dong's thriller is a subtle, involving, mysterious and shocking slow-burn.|Fresh
A stunted writer gets wrapped up in a mysterious romantic triangle in Lee Chang-dong's yawningly meticulous Korean mumblecore Gatsby riff.|Rotten
The mystery doesn't offer any tangible answers, but I can't wait to get lost in it all over again.|Fresh
[Director Lee] Chang-dong ... very intelligently expands the transcendence and depth of the story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
To turn a 20-page story into a two-and-a-half-hour film, more than boldness, you have to have ideas. And the Korean Lee Chang-dong has talent and ideas. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
An evocative and difficult-to-shake film that overcomes its bloated run-time with a trio of immaculate performances.|Fresh
Burning actually justifies its running time by slowly building paranoid atmosphere before an explosive, hauntingly ambiguous finale.|Fresh
[It features] Steven Yeun in a mesmerizingly smart star turn.|Fresh
Burning is many things-a thriller, a mystery, a comedy, a tale of unrequited love-but all of it builds toward a crushing, existential masterpiece.|Fresh
And just like the world we live in, where the inequalities between rich and poor and male and female only grow crueler and less escapable, the rage that undergirds Burning is instantly familiar.|Fresh
Like a brooding nightmare, Burning washes over audiences with passing visions of multiple lives, secrets and betrayals, all leading to no single, clean-cut or simple explanation.|Fresh
Burning is a brooding, unforgettable film whose core thematic concern is the unseen feminine as much as the visible masculine.|Fresh
It's long. Slow. And I had no patience for it.|Rotten
The film culminates the tensions that arise in a masterful finale. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Steven Yeun brings the full weight of his international star power to bear in this haunting South Korean revenge story.|Fresh
Lee Chang-dong's latest is among his greatest work, a smouldering study of jealously, anger as well as indulgence. Burning is masterful.|Fresh
Lee Chang-dong's Burning moves at a pace all its own, telling a tale of mystery and obsession with no easy answers. Hypnotic, haunting, and featuring an incredible performance from Steven Yuen, Burning is one of the year's best movies.|Fresh
Burning succeeds because it understands that the answers it asks and the questions it refuses to grant closure to are only part of what makes an experience such as this so ultimately thrilling.|Fresh
"Acclaimed Korean director Lee Chang-dong has fleshed out the minimalist narrative of Murakami's story and created an extended ending, turning ""Burning"" from mere rumination into a dramatic suspense thriller..."|Fresh
Burning comes out looking somewhat behind on the times. Its interest in the psychosexual makeup of its male characters comes at the expense of its women, who are either removed from the story, or relegated to thinly-written background characters.|Rotten
As it dips into murder-mystery territory, then something more quiet and philosophical, Chang-dong writes a story both expected and surprising.|Fresh
With Burning, Lee extraordinarily obliterates the bifurcation between life and representation, the thing in itself and the metaphor.|Fresh
A movie that makes you reconsider all the other times you called movies haunting because this one gets under your skin in completely unexpected ways.|Fresh
The three actors bring a vitality and intensity to their roles, making the film a gripping character study.|Fresh
A tightly wound, increasingly bleak masterpiece.|Fresh
Undeniably gorgeous, strewn with sequences of pure cinematic verve... The film's sweltering tension and commitment to its lack of easy answers is commendable, but less so is its treatment of women.|Fresh
Burning is a slow-burn affair that will test, and reward, patient viewers -- not that all mysteries will be solved and gift-wrapped to our satisfaction, but the bottled-up enigma of the protagonists... will come blazing like a star.|Fresh
Gradually, almost imperceptibly, the movie switches gears and turns into a deepening mystery.|Fresh
A ruminative mystery, a fine-tuned character study and an intricately observed examination of human relationships.|Fresh
"It's a film that understands the power of suggestion-the force of a silent, fiery nightmare-and ""rings to the very bones."""|Fresh
It's gripping and unnerving, a noir-style mystery with no answers that goes in entirely unexpected directions (and harbors a hint of William Faulkner too).|Fresh
This is the most absorbing movie I've seen this year, as well as the most layered and enigmatic.|Fresh
There's surely more to unpick here on second viewing: Chang-dong has spun a philosophical, slow-burn yarn that remains constantly gripping through its entire 148-minute runtime.|Fresh
[Burning's] biggest issue here is that it needs two hours to tell its story. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
The film feels like Lee Chang-dong's most reflexive comment on the dramatic possibilities of his favored narrative form.|Fresh
Not a lot actually burns in Lee Chang-dong's Burning. A barn, in a dream. A car. The tips of cigarettes. A joint. But the cumulative effect of all its perfect moments, all its perfectly true, unexpected and consequential scenes, is scorching.|Fresh
This is Lee's closest ever film to a thriller, but it defies expectations, offering multiple, murky solutions to a set of mysteries at once.|Fresh
Lee Chang-dong's dexterity with the telling minutiae of human interactions ensures that Burning makes for an emotionally gripping film.|Fresh
Burning keeps twisting back on itself, charting the path of a man waking up to the world, only to find that it won't stop messing with him.|Fresh
Each and every one of [director] Lee Chang-dong's adaptation decisions in Burning, based on the story Barn Burning by Haruki Murakami, serve to magnify a much weaker base material than the resulting film... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The result is a strict realistic and prosaic narrative's disquieting tale, but whose inner nature is allowed to infect the abyss of the fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This slow burn cooks.|Fresh
This entire film is meticulously calibrated in its ambiguity, encouraging certain assumptions that neither the characters nor the audience can ever fully verify, so it's best to be on one's toes.|Fresh
This is a gripping nightmare.|Fresh
A slow dramatic simmer that intensifies gradually over two-and-a-half perfectly measured hours, until it reaches a shocking and powerful crescendo.|Fresh
