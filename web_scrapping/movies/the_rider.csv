Pain is the only thing I can think about when watching The Rider. Honest, raw and humane pain. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
This true story hauntingly explores masculinity in the American Western tradition. A real family plays themselves in this fictionalized version of their lives. I suspect we will see many brilliant films from the director, Chloe Zhao.|Fresh

"""Best of 2018"" Zhao blows away the traditional western movie stereotypes of cowboy, Indian, rodeo, horse whisperer-and a century of those American symbols of masculinity."|Fresh
The S.D. cowboy and broncobuster, no longer able to do the job that gave his life shape and purpose, gets saved by what he learns from his devotion to the beauty, stillness, mystery and wildness of horses.|Fresh
Authentic... Beautiful and understated... Full of heartbreak and humanity.|Fresh
A modern cowboy history. The decadence. The selfimprovement. The better in the worst. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Rider reshapes the traditional cowboy narrative in a way that both embraces and challenges western tropes.|Fresh
What rests beneath this authenticity of modern America is a tender tale of striving for one's dreams, even amongst the harshest conditions imaginable.|Fresh
The Rider resists...easy interpretations and expands audience imaginations...with a sense of cinematic poetry and verve.|Fresh
Occasionally a film comes along that captures an honest slice of American life with performances so authentic that you forget you're watching a movie. Writer-director Chloé Zhao is responsible for one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
It is more than just a beautiful postcard - it's a film that has a story that will stay with you long after you've left the theater.|Fresh
"A quiet character study, ""The Rider"" is almost documentary-like in its approach."|Fresh
One of my favorite movies of the year, thus far.|Fresh
It seems that each narrative element of the film is arranged to make us connect with nature. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The beauty of Zhao's film is that it celebrates being human without veering into sentimentality.|Fresh
A hugely impressive slice of prairie naturalism.|Fresh
This is a film of subtle, unspoken grace notes, an intimate and deeply moving portrait of both Blackburn and the community of which he is part. It is an understated gem of a film, and marks Zhao as a major talent.|Fresh
[Director Chloe] Zhao observes her objects of study with attention, reluctant to be condescending to them or to romanticize them. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Working with non-professional actors from the Pine Ridge community, Zhao tells the fictionalised true story of bareback bronc rider Brady Blackburn.|Fresh
Jandreau proves a charismatic draw, even if some of the supporting non-actors struggle with naturalistic performances.|Fresh
A meticulous and thoughtful, beautifully realised and visually resplendent film that really gets under the skin of its central character and makes him a relatable figure.|Fresh
There is nothing here that approaches a conventional plot so the pace can feel slow. It is a memorable film but the story feels a little thinly spread.|Fresh
A remarkable film in many respects, and Zhao works wonders with a non-professional cast.|Fresh
An example of regional American cinema at its finest.|Fresh
What is most startling here is the sensitivity with which [director Chloé] Zhao tackles such a downbeat tale.|Fresh
The Rider is an extraordinary film.|Fresh
The Rider could easily have been pitying or patronising but it is suffused instead with warmth, understanding and insightful detail|Fresh
Not fiction; not documentary. Instead, a story standing under a chimerical moon while fate, laconic and inarticulate like its victims, growls from far off.|Fresh
Young Jandreau gives a towering performance, broody, watchful, charismatic.|Fresh
An extraordinary semidocumentary drama, beautiful and beautifully accomplished, about dignity, work, and masculinity. Heartbreaking and yet utterly unsentimental, this is one of the best and most important films of the year.|Fresh
So soulful that it almost hurts to watch it.|Fresh
A thoughtful and thought-provoking look at identity, aspiration and a precarious way of life, this is anchored by a stunning performance by Brady Jundreau and inspired direction by Chloé Zhao.|Fresh
Even if Zhao overstates one or two metaphors, she captures Brady's inner struggle with mesmerising authenticity.|Fresh
There is an infinite sadness involving Zhao's The Rider but also an immeasurable humanity.|Fresh
The result is a magnificent look at what it means to be human.|Fresh
Elegant and cinematic, but at the same time a spontaneous work of verite, The Rider breaks its own cinematic ground.|Fresh
Zhao has shown herself to be a wonderful storyteller, and I can't wait to see what she does next.|Fresh
The western is weighed down by pacing issues [and]...development problems. Ultimately, the film is unable to conjure the emotions that the plot is heavily reliant upon.|Rotten
A work of staggering heartbreak.|Fresh
"Like a rodeo man clinging on for dear life, ""The Rider"" is a tough film to shake, even well after you've experienced the ride."|Fresh
The long scenes of the competitions are particularly striking. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
For a story in which emotions are tamped down and shunted, The Rider finds a moving and difficult power.|Fresh
The Rider has a wisdom all its own. ... It becomes a film about how the pain of loss and disappointment enables us to bear one another's burdens.|Fresh
Acting is best left to actors, lest you get this kind of shiftless, awkwardly mumbling emptiness going on for the entire length of a very drearily slow-moving movie.|Rotten
One of the year's most empathetic, soulful and heart-wrenching efforts.|Fresh
Chlo Zhao's elegant documentary-flavored vision... is an exemplar in how movies can look and feel in this still-early part of the second century of cinema.|Fresh
There is minimalistic elegance to this film that couldn't help but blow me away.|Fresh
It's often said that great films have the ability to transport you to a certain time, place and specific perspective, however unfamiliar that might be. Rarely is that more relevant than in The Rider.|Fresh
A masterpiece about the human condition.|Fresh
The unexpected result of this often majestic film, as keenly written/directed by Chloe Zhao, is the likelihood of Jandreau actually becoming a movie star.|Fresh
The movie is technically rough and its narrative is a bit wobbly. But because the story is so close to the lives of the actors, it has a unique emotional power that few films do.|Fresh
Gripping rodeo film showing sympathy for the Native Americans living in need on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.|Fresh
The slightest twinge of emotional conflict sends the lead character outside to stare blankly into the sunlight... those empty stares are almost too apt for a film with an offscreen story that is so much more interesting than the actual movie.|Fresh
A deeply spiritual film about loss, caring, and starting over.|Fresh
"""The Rider"" is a masterful character study that honors but doesn't romanticize a vanishing way of life."|Fresh
It's a small movie about a small-time rodeo rider. But emotionally, it stands taller than any blockbuster about spandex-wearing superheroes or wisecracking space smugglers.|Fresh
Evocative, empathetic and elegiac - a captivating, contemporary Western.|Fresh
Part Western, part meditation on what it means to be a man, part elegy for a way of life.|Fresh
It's so quiet that at times it feels like it doesn't want to disturb any other movies playing in neighboring theaters. But you'll definitely be swept away by its beautiful spirit - if you just hold on.|Fresh
'The Rider' is a sensitive feature that should be seen and appreciated. It is an original vision about a small segment of America that - at times - almost feels like another nation, and one worth visiting.|Fresh
"With its slow pace that subtly builds tension, its breathtaking camera work and its heartbreaking-yet-life-affirming view of a world unfamiliar to most of us, ""The Rider"" swept me away."|Fresh
Zhao has created a charismatic star and a brilliant - must see twice - view of a powerful segment of American life.|Fresh
Chlo Zhao's second film invites social commentary and political dissection... but there's nothing clearer, or more devastating, in The Rider than the bond between cowboy and horse.|Fresh
It's an achievement of ethical imagination from writer-director Chlo Zhao. In dramatizing Brady's real-life dilemma, the Chinese filmmaker defies tremendous storytelling constraints by producing art that repels cultural tourism.|Fresh
The spirit that emanates from the setting, characters, relationships and direction is brilliant.|Fresh
A stark and beautiful elegy to a way of life literally riding off into the sunset, and the first great film of 2018.|Fresh
The Rider is slow going in spots, but it will surprise you with moments of great, simple beauty. Climb onboard, and you're not likely to forget it.|Fresh
In tune with the majestic sweep of the Badlands landscape, director [Chloe] Zhao casts a spell.|Fresh
Director Chloe Zhao does an admirable job of introducing us to the rodeo world without being didactic about it.|Fresh
Fiction and reality blur powerfully into a dizzying treatise on not just a broken cowboy, but also America.|Fresh
A beautiful, luminous film and one of the year's best.|Fresh
"Zhao has made a movie about how one man copes with the pain that accompanies loss. Brady certainly knows how to ""cowboy up,"" but we know his pain is real -- and so does he."|Fresh
The scenes between real-life friends Brady Jandreau and Lane Scott are the most haunting in the film because every moment, every glance, every unspoken word that collapses into a sigh feels intimate.|Fresh
This Bressonian hybrid will launch writer-director Chloe Zhao and leading man and real-life cowboy Brady Jandreau. A not to be missed spiritual journey of man and horse.|Fresh
Beautifully shot and perfectly paced, The Rider also balances precisely atop the fiction/documentary divide.|Fresh
Painting an achingly, literally real portrait of a lifestyle that is usually mocked and played for cheap laughs on screen rather than shown empathy, The Rider offers unshakably devastating insight|Fresh
The Rider offers a subtle, mournful study of a man without purpose...|Fresh
The Rider is Jandreau's story to tell, and he relives every moment of this terrible time in his life with an unbelievable stoicism and psychological depth.|Fresh
In fact, the theme of the movie might actually be the unspoken codes of masculinity, in which something-the rocky terrain, the Indigenous people, the untamed animals-must be dominated in order for men to feel like men.|Rotten
An elegiac, ruminative modern western about a young South Dakota rodeo rider who must decide what choices to make after suffering a serious head injury.|Fresh
[Chloe] Zhao lyrically frames the characters within the shots, making them seem part of the landscape. Everything and everyone are natural parts of the images...|Fresh
It's just plain excellent.|Fresh
You will want to be there, pulling for Brady, no matter what choices he makes. More importantly, you will care about those choices, and about him.|Fresh
Zhao brings a documentarian's eye to his story, augmented with some striking photography making the most of the movie's picturesque Badlands geography.|Fresh
Zhao turns material that might have been treacly and simple-minded into an allegory of male identity...with the quality of myth.|Fresh
[Director Chloe] Zhao and her films are worth discovering, and The Rider is a welcome surprise.|Fresh
...simultaneously evokes and deflates our image of the iconic American West.|Fresh
A moving and sensitive look at wounded masculinity in America's heartland...|Fresh
"""The Rider"" could be, if I did not know better, an honest documentary about the life of a rodeo rider."|Fresh
A remarkable, deeply moving melding of fact and fiction.|Fresh
Classic American masculinity and its consequences get confronted in writer-director Chlo Zhao's poignant ode to the cowboy, The Rider.|Fresh
This evocative and quietly powerful glimpse into masculinity and Western heritage expertly captures the rhythms of its subject, both visually and emotionally.|Fresh
What makes the film special is director Chlo Zhao's empathy for her subjects.|Fresh
Zhao manages to get performances out of her nonprofessional cast that feel authentic rather than awkward|Fresh
But the performances [Chloe] Zhao has gotten from her non-professional cast members are remarkable, and The Rider is one of those films that feels utterly, urself-consciously true to a reality not terribly close to the usual mythology of movie westerns.|Fresh
It's a kind of parable, delivered in a manner that has nothing to do with preaching.|Fresh
"""The Rider"" reinvigorates tropes from the western genre of men, horses, honor codes and vast expanses of nature with a refreshing lack of sentimentality, without sacrificing their inherent lyricism and poetry."|Fresh
Brady's world is also one of tragedy and hardship, biological fragility taking its toll not only on Brady but those he loves, changing times curtailing his options.|Fresh
Beautifully photographed on [the] Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the film offers ... gorgeous vistas as background for its heartbreaking elegy of a time present, yet already gone by.|Fresh
The movie is soulful, elegant, filmed as often as not at the magic hour, when the sky is as broad as it is orange-yellow, and every nook of the world seems alight with possibility.|Fresh
But as wrenching as The Rider can be at times, it's also suspenseful and beautiful - a modern-day Western with a hero who's a real discovery.|Fresh
Simplicity is not in vogue among today's filmmakers, but The Rider is so consistently good that it has wowed critics and audiences on the film festival circuit. Just don't approach it with outsized expectations.|Fresh
Zhao seems to have filmed with her head down, focussed on her screenplay, rather than up, focussed on the richness of what was taking place around her.|Rotten
Filmmaker Chlo Zhao turns the story of real-life bronc rider Brady Jandreau into a gritty, graceful character study. Once The Rider hooks you - and believe me, it will - there's no way you will ever forget it.|Fresh
In his debut, Jandreau's soft, understated performance gives him the presence of a screen veteran.|Fresh
A neo-Western about rodeo riding, hobbled masculinity and reflective grace that feels unlike anything else out there.|Fresh
It's a rare treat to be so affected by-and connected to-a movie hero of so few words, and such vivid ones.|Fresh
What really distinguishes [Zhao's] work here is something beyond great filmmaking chops: a vision that is deeply humanistic, founded on a compassionate realism that honors the heartfelt struggles of all the creatures it encounters.|Fresh
The Rider serves as a showcase for Zhao's multifaceted talents, has a searingly dramatic storyline with gripping themes and subtexts, and boasts an impressive ensemble of non-actors.|Fresh
"Writer/director Chlo Zhao's gorgeous film ""The Rider"" is a perfect example of a filmmaker's devotion to her craft. I truly hope Ms. Zhao follows up on Brady's progress --- ""The Rider"" demands a sequel."|Fresh
"""The Rider"" plays like a virtual documentary, and in some ways it is just that. Yet these flesh-and-blood denizens of South Dakota are quite credible actors, a tribute to Zhao's skill behind the camera."|Fresh
Ms. Zhao's commitment to her craft - she knows how to take care and when to take risks - matches Brady's.|Fresh
The Rider is the best film I've seen so far in 2018. It also feels like the announcement of a major artistic talent in Zhao.|Fresh
This excellent sophomore film by a Chinese writer-director is a rare look at the life of a young Native American man.|Fresh
A vista-worshipping, socially observant, and altogether moving exploration of how difficult it is to be wise even when the alternative is statistically guaranteed death.|Fresh
Achieves a nearly perfect balance between what's engineered and what's observed, allowing everyone on screen to embody their own messy lives while keeping them corralled to a compelling and tightly structured (if somewhat familiar) narrative.|Fresh
"[Chloe] Zhao and ""The Rider"" are the real deal."|Fresh
"""The Rider"" comes as close to a spiritual experience as anything I've encountered in a movie theater this year."|Fresh
One of the year's most arresting and unforgettable films.|Fresh
This haunting drama is a spiritual, perhaps more understated cousin of The Wrestler , handled with a deft, tender touch.|Fresh
Captures the excitement of rodeos.|Fresh
The Rider is art imitating life in one of the best ways. Because the main characters are not trained actors, the film benefits and it produces a story that is heart-wrenching, unfiltered and intimate.|Fresh
Avoiding nostalgia over the American western and forged from the lives of its actors, Chlo Zhao's film is an intimate and sensual triumph.|Fresh
The occasional lyrical music that over-pounds the film's mournful tone. Nevertheless, it's a remarkable achievement from both Zhao and all her actors.|Fresh
The Rider confirms Zhao as one of the great new American directors, looking at the lives of people too often ignored in cinema, and in a way too often not attempted.|Fresh
While many filmmakers attempt to give a voice to the marginal and ignored, few do so with the same artistic and sensitivity displayed here [by Chlo Zhao].|Fresh
As for The Rider, its naturally occurring mood is one of elegiac grandeur.|Fresh
Chlo Zhao delivers a tremendous sophomore feature.|Fresh
The Rider is a small film of great beauty and great resonance.|Fresh
Zhao's film derives its power from the truth that both drives it and inspires it, and the final result is a wholly unique slice-of-life drama.|Fresh
While The Rider is a compelling story, the tone of the film across the board tends to remain flat - and at times boring.|Fresh
It manifests a mounting sense of disillusionment, suggesting that the rodeo lifestyle many characters so unreservedly romanticize often leads to physical and psychological ruin.|Fresh
It's difficult to describe the immense weight that descends upon you when you realize you're seeing real Indian reservation cowboys moving through a lightly fictionalized version of their lives.|Fresh
When we let go of our prejudices and embrace the unknown, what follows has the potential to excite and amaze. The Rider is a case in point.|Fresh
Beautiful, intelligent, and sensitive.|Fresh
The Rider is a thing of exquisite beauty.|Fresh
[Chlo] Zhao's artful look into the American West is a lightly brooding winner. Clearly this isn't her first time at the rodeo.|Fresh
Casting non-actors as versions of themselves - [Brady] Jandreau acts opposite his real father and sister - [Chlo] Zhao situates the story in a fully lived-in world.|Fresh
For beautiful, intimate moments, few films at Cannes this year were in the same league as The Rider.|Fresh
The result is an entrancing, deeply moving effort, one that is certain to steal the hearts of audiences on its wider release.|Fresh
In telling the story of a disappearing slice of America, Zhao has created a portrait of resilience, and the bonds that last even after the rodeo's over.|Fresh
The Rider marries the majestic vistas of the greatest American westerns with a deeply interior story of a cowboy having to renegotiate his identity.|Fresh
Heavy-hearted cowboys, wild horses and broken dreams: The Rider is a great film about what it means to be a man.|Fresh
While this is a familiar theme that viewers have watched countless times, the way Zhao has scripted and directed The Rider makes it something new.|Fresh
Movies that blend real life and fiction usually foreground the docu-style realism, using the poetry as grace notes or punctuation. Zhao privileges both, and in so doing creates a work of heartbreaking beauty.|Fresh
The pretended epic of rodeo, so idiosyncratically American, appears hollow in front of the several wounded and amputated that parade on screen. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Zhao's combination of the visual palette of Malick, the social backbone of Reichardt, and the spontaneity of Cassavetes creates cinema verit in the American plains.|Fresh
Gains artful integrity from Zhao's favored docu-fiction technique - roughly tracing a script around the experiences of her non-professional actors - and dusty-dreamy visual style.|Fresh
It's a very impressive, very accomplished film.|Fresh
Zhao's story may strain as it edges down familiar routes, but its emotional connections pulsate throughout, making this a natural for festival and arthouse play to Zhao's growing fanbase.|Fresh
Beautifully captures the way a handful of people stoically deal with the meager hands life has dealt them.|Fresh
