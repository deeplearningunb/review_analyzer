The Coen Brothers at their best. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The western anthology of shorts starts with a bang and quickly fades into a whimper.|Rotten
"The section of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs titled ""Meal Ticket"" is the best in the film. The darkest, bleakest, and the most macabre, this vignette evokes the hellish carnival world of Tod Browning..."|Fresh
We all know the anthology's shortcomings - too little time to establish too many characters, all breadth no depth, and variable quality between chapters...Buster Scruggs is no different, bearing all of those flaws, but bearing them lightly.|Fresh
Lately the Coen Brothers seem content to simply pay homage to classic storytelling (in this case the western) instead of crafting compelling scripts within said genre.|Rotten
...each of the ballad's half dozen chapters effectively succeeds on its own terms thanks to the Coens' deadeye knack for plot and dialogue, humor and foreboding, the unexpected detail and the cruel twist of irony.|Fresh
It's disappointing that the Coens don't even try to upend any classic Western clichés in The Ballad of Buster Scruggs - they apply some grim humor to various situations, but that's about it.|Rotten
Because there's also something to be desired in each alone, though, the feature-length construction definitely helps [it prove a unified success].|Fresh
I enjoyed most of these stories, except for 'Meal Ticket,' which seems pretty tasteless to me. You have to accept death along with humor in most Coen brothers movies, and you get multiple doses of death in this movie.|Fresh
...original, brainy, and funny.|Fresh

In any case, what lies behind the six film stories that make up The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a duet of consecrated filmmakers, located above good and evil, already alienated from the impetus of having to show how good they are. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
While it's a little hit and miss as a collection, the entire effort of Buster Scruggs is worthy of praise simply as an exercise in a notoriously tough format.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs feels like the Coen brothers' B-sides compilation... . That smugness to which the Coens are susceptible is in plentiful supply here.|Rotten
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs functions like a greatest hits album for the Coens, though somehow with songs we've never heard before.|Fresh
The Coen's survey of American mythology hits every note.|Fresh
"Well-acted, sumptuously produced yet always challenging - especially to viewers sensitive to overt images of violence - ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is classic Coen, if not classic Western."|Fresh
The Coen brothers' cynical, savvy anthology, consisting of six existential, bleakly humorous vignettes.|Fresh
It might be too bizarre a film for all tastes, nevertheless it's a brilliantly endearing, funny and haunting one.|Fresh
Pure, uncut Coen brothers, with a little bit of just about everything they've ever done hiding inside one or more of the chapters.|Fresh
The Coens achieve the simple but difficult task of creating refreshing entertainment by resorting to what they do best: cinema as it was meant to be in its golden age. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The fatalism and mortality that pervade The Ballad of Buster Scruggs has more in common with the macabre churnings of Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville than Louis L'Amour.|Fresh
The Coens' signature dry humour and brilliant, often unexpected story rhythms are employed in every chapter to stunning effect.|Fresh
In this Western anthology film, the shorts that are the strongest more than make up for the flaws in the others.|Fresh
"""The Coens have directed a magnificent nathology not only of the western cinema, but of their own filmography""."|Fresh
testament to the Coens' far-flung sensibilities and their persistent agility in wringing comedy, pathos, and irony from the most well-worn of genre conventions, respecting them while also gleefully dismantling them|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a divine tasting board for all things Coen brothers...|Fresh
The first and second narratives are blisteringly fun and energetic, but onwards from there the pace slackens enormously.|Rotten
The mosaic arrangement of the shorts, varying in greatness and mediocrity, causes The Ballad of Buster Scruggs to miss the mark as a cohesive whole.|Rotten
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs alternates between dark, lunatic humor and darker, depressing morbidity. In other words, it's The Full Coen.|Fresh
The Coens love how fate places a banana peel under the feet of those foolish enough to look up at stars. Desire makes fools of everyone and to the Coens, that is rich comic material.|Fresh
So the good news here is that The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is chock-full of cunning cowpokes, ornery outlaws and frontier freaks doing their thing in the wild, wild west of yesteryear.|Fresh
These six stories add up to an achievement that is wise, ridiculous, gorgeous, hideous, and contains some of the best onscreen monologues and original characters of all time.|Fresh
A little John Wayne here, a little John Wayne Gacy there, the brothers' latest is freaky frontier fun and the definitive riff on how the West was weird.|Fresh
Although the grandiloquence of the 70mm would have done well, this is a sovereign and joyful film, at last more Coen than western. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bonkers, attractive, poignant and smothered in Coen goodness, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a damn fine ode to Old Hollywood and the Wild West.|Fresh
... an unabashedly bleak yet oddly hopeful and entertaining meditation on the Coens' perennial preoccupations - the folly of human nature and death.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs confirms the great ability of the Coens to be authors of the highest level, to which we also forgive a little more length. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The anthology format gives the Coens room to tinker with new tones and forms, while delivering their unique blend of comedy and dread.|Fresh
Unpredictable and masterful.|Fresh
The storytelling is so delicate and precise, like a beautiful poem squeezed of every superfluous word. This is some of the Coen Brothers best work and it deserves to be seen.|Fresh
The opening segment might be the best 15 minutes of any film this year. Unfortunately, the film never reaches that level again.|Fresh
"There is so much to enjoy in The Ballad of Buster Scruggs that I can't help but (mostly) forgive those shortcomings. Any film that has a man insisting that ""people are like ferrets"" is all right by me."|Fresh
The Coen bros. don't disappoint! Up there with some of their best work. Also, Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is simply gorgeous. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Amidst the order of the stories and their characters complementing one another, what drives the film is an emotional simplicity.|Fresh
The Coen Brothers' supreme mastery of all elements of cinematic storytelling are on full display ... Frequently hilarious, occasionally moving and always stunningly beautiful.|Fresh
Even when the film seemingly expresses a sunny disposition, that's just its devilishness playing possum.|Fresh
Its six disparate chapters - one hysterically funny, most doggedly grim - would be better apart than together, each gnawed on and digested on its own terms.|Rotten
With the Coens we learned that violence can be frightening, but also beautifully photographed. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Playing like a cross between the first half hour of The Hateful Eight and an episode of The Twilight Zone, the final story is breezy, morbid and the most obviously parabolic.|Fresh
Delightful, weird, dark, and incredibly funny, each vignette serves as a crash course in Coen-ology.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs features six narratively-unrelated Old West challenges to genre mythology that are so practically effortless, so technically perfect, that the typical Coen payload of misanthropy and...nihilism lands as particularly caustic.|Fresh
Scruggs doesn't behave like a typical movie-not even a typical Coen brothers movie. But these two have been amusing themselves-and us-with evasive, masterful films for more than three decades|Fresh
Six stories set in the Old West, each with a message about mortality.|Fresh
The believers of the honorable cowboy will feel confronted, but it's in this clash that catharsis and change is created. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"The film's self-pleasing, self-loathing ""smartness"" makes this wannabe epic -- a story of things half-believed that yet cause Americans to quake -- a gruesome landmark of movies in 2018."|Rotten
It's near-impossible to guess what the Coens will do next. One can only hope that it's as good as The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs.|Fresh
The Coen Brothers' latest movie is a hoot.|Fresh
Scruggs is a cinematic achievement of the marriage between the strange and the mainstream, of the reconciliation between the legendary and the literal, and of the push/pull between the known and the unknown.|Fresh
As is common with the short film format, it's more about narrative sleight-of-hand than thematic sophistication, but each story has its own merits.|Fresh
"The Coen brothers' new anthology film, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, portrays the frontier as a place of death so sudden and terrible that the word ""ironic"" is too fancy for it."|Fresh
Old West anthology is riveting, unconventional, violent.|Fresh
"Despite having only the Western genre and a vague thematic through-line of ""death"" in common, the stories build on one another, subtly cohering into something greater than the sum of its parts."|Fresh
The Coens bring us their most gorgeous, visceral, and unpredictable film to date with Buster Scruggs.|Fresh
Any full-length Coen brothers' movie beats these six shorts, but they're all gorgeous, original and often funny.|Fresh
[The Coen Brothers] have not created the most iconic film of their career, but bring a unique bend to the American Western in the process.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is every classic Hollywood Western as it's no classic Hollywood Western, much as it's every Coen Brothers film while it's no Coen Brothers film.|Fresh
Let the Coens take you on funny, yet incredibly depressing, journey through a vicious land.|Fresh
There are laughs aplenty in this lawless, arbitrary Old West, but a feel-good yarn it ain't.|Fresh
For all its flaws, it's the story of America as it is now, because of what it was then.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a well crafted, if narrow, anthology about life in the West, with a hefty gloss of cinema-magic.|Fresh
The vast expanse of the Wild West does not prevent those who pass on from being forgotten, and the way their marks are left inscribed within this mythos makes this a film of great philosophical import.|Fresh
I wasn't exactly thrilled with such an inauspicious beginning, or with the second adventure, either, which continues the entire anthology's apparent connection of living and (mostly) dying in the Old West.|Fresh
A minor Coen effort in the grand scheme, but this whimsical, offbeat, surprising, beautifully self-aware and strangely affecting chronicle is a treat for fans of their work.|Fresh
Each story feels unique, yet cut from the same cloth. Here are six tales from the American Frontier, six tales of violence and vengeance, irony and existence, survival and betrayal.|Fresh
The film is an intriguing experiment for the Coens and it's one that's very rewarding for the viewer.|Fresh
"With ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" the Coen brothers sing a different tune, albeit in a minor key. Ah, but what sweet music!"|Fresh
Buster Scruggs is full-blooded bliss splashed across an American frontier as mad and savage as decades of storied nightmarish incivility. It's bleak. It's bloody. It's bounteous. Probably great!|Fresh
Tragedy is at the forefront of the Coen Brothers western anthology. The wildly entertaining yarn incorporates many of the Coen's staples, quirky characters, witty dialogue, and plenty of misfortune.|Fresh
Uneven, but it exhibits the brothers' quirky sense of humor throughout, as well as their undeniable filmmaking finesse.|Fresh
Couldn't look more like a carefully constructed omnibus if it emerged from the Amicus imprint during the 1960s and featured Christopher Lee as the Host and Joan Collins as the Girl.|Fresh
Will not be to every taste, but for a few of us it's a treasure trove worth re-visiting, whether in small dips, or in another deep-dive.|Fresh
Certain segments are far more engaging than others, but overall The Ballad of Buster Scruggs makes for an intriguing piece of anthology storytelling.|Fresh
It's occasional magic realism, painful sweetness and unique worldview makes it clearly Coen and is among their best films.|Fresh
As usual, the Coens have reinterpreted our mythic tales and jolted our imaginations.|Fresh
The Coen brothers are past masters of the form and concoct a heady brew of Wild West tales here.|Fresh
For all its hot-iron violence, The Ballad is a raucously funny tale, and the humour carries into the second chamber piece, full of actual gallows humour.|Fresh
Those Coen brothers have once again struck storytelling gold by heading to the outdoors.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a rootin', tootin', dang fine bit o' work slotted firmly in the good books of the Coens filmography.|Fresh
One should never take a Coen Brothers film for granted, but this definitely feels like one of the least of their efforts.|Rotten
It's like a beautifully embroidered needlework laid across a gravesite.|Fresh
Some stories are better than others, but even the best are merely pleasantly diverting, while the bad are distractingly mediocre.|Rotten
These punchy little tales veer from slapstick to tragedy, all working in service of the Coens' fatalistic, class-clown philosophy, according to which life might be just a cruel, cosmic joke but it's a pretty good one sometimes.|Fresh
[B]ecause the film comes from Ethan and Joel Coen, it is ... as funny and clever as it is despairing and hopeless.|Fresh
Serves as a perfect smorgasbord of their work: Gross yet laugh-out-loud violence, memorable characters, and storylines that are never far from taking a turn for the macabre.|Fresh
I couldn't recommend it with more of a yee-haw!|Fresh
All six of the stories in the film are riveting and although they knew the film was destined to be seen mainly on the small screen, the Coens are at the top of their visual game.|Fresh
If I had to choose a favorite of the six, it would be the Buster Scruggs yarn, but each of the stories is full and complete.|Fresh
The wild west was rough. Structuring an anthology film around such a controversial but uproariously entertaining period in time is also challenging and is both the greatest strength and most glaring flaw of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs|Fresh
Not all of the episodes are successful and, sorry to say, stretches of the movie are duller than you might expect from the Coens. But this is a Coen brothers film and, as such, demands some attention...|Rotten
Not all the chapters work as well as some, but as an entire 'being', it's deeply enjoyable.|Fresh
There's fun to be had in the gallows humor weaving throughout the short stories on display here. But in general, Buster Scruggs feels undercooked.|Fresh
"Ethan and Joel Coen have a reputation for making films that shatter expectations, and ""Ballad"" is no exception."|Fresh
There's also entirely too much talk and an ending that goes nowhere. But the film as a whole satisfies, even if it's something less than the sum of its parts. Any new Coen Bros. offering is always worth celebrating.|Fresh
You'll be tempted to pick favorites. But the real pleasure here is in watching ideas unfold across and between these stories.|Fresh
Maybe all these dutifully meaningless stories would have been easier to swallow spaced out into standalone episodes, as the directors had originally planned.|Rotten
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is one of the strangest and least legible of the Coen brothers' films, but it also revels in their sheer joy in creating movies.|Fresh
The Coens whisk through these stories in impressive fashion as the tone shifts from darkly comical to unexpectedly violent... [These] shifts aren't easy to pull off, but the Coens make it look effortless -- crafting a film that never missteps.|Fresh
A unique and unpredictably screwy ride.|Fresh
Whether you view it in a theater or at home, you owe it to yourself to see it as it is one of the year's very best films and one more notable chapter in one of the most extraordinary filmographies of our time.|Fresh
Eccentric characters - including a mathematically blessed hen - abound in vignettes that boast a uniquely wry sense of the absurd. If some outstay their welcome, no matter - there's always another just round the corner.|Fresh
Ultimately, Buster Scruggs is lesser Coen, despite the movie bearing many of the filmmakers' trademarks. Both silly and serious, it's a hodgepodge in spurs, a horse opera with nothing but arias.|Fresh
"""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is a Coen brothers western-style buffet that didn't quite work out, so they're serving it to us on one plate. If you eat around a few items, there's certainly enough for a meal."|Fresh
"The short films in ""Buster Scruggs"" are playthings, but the Coens are playing with no mere frivolity."|Fresh
The Coens' Western feature/miniseries is extremely watchable, packed with curios and contrasts and narrative twists, filled with the sincere and the ersatz, the stupid and the clever, the grotesque and the goofy.|Fresh
Death emerges as a theme - first as a punchline, then as a chilling presence.|Fresh
Even when Buster Scruggs isn't firing on all cylinders, it remains a warm and cheeky tribute to a genre that the brothers behind True Grit and No Country For Old Men clearly love.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a formidable first outing for the Coens on a streaming format, but there is no doubt that this narrative six-shooter has a couple of duds.|Fresh
"""Ballad"" paints a deliciously dismal portrait of the human condition."|Fresh
Taken as a whole, it's not an unpleasant experience, but the tonal whiplash involved in watching it is stunning.|Fresh
Even if you watch it on your phone, there's an integrity and a weight to the thing that lingers long after the last page is turned. And a couple of awfully catchy songs.|Fresh
If the Coens' Hail, Caesar! seemed like inside baseball, this savage assault on the milk-drinking cowboys of yesterday delves even deeper into semi-forgotten movies.|Fresh
"Every tale in ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" runs out of steam before it runs out of story."|Rotten
The Coen brothers' greatest trick is balancing the ironic commentary on cinema and storytelling with the dramatic impact of compelling human stories well told. And it's a trick they pull off again and again.|Fresh
The Coens... have experimented with shorts before (just not in their own theatrically released feature). But, as usual, they make it seem fresh.|Fresh
"All in all, this ""Buster"" is something else."|Fresh
I came away haunted by a scattering of sights and sounds...|Fresh
The Coens masterfully flit from jet-black drama to tear-stained sentimentality to ruthless savagery to ambiguous morality, while keeping a tight rein on every surprising narrative.|Fresh
Unfortunately, these six campfire stories also distinctly feel like odds and ends that've been sitting in a drawer gathering dust.|Rotten
You will not want to miss this twisted tale of cowboys, indians and more than a few unsavory folks looking for a gunfight.|Fresh
I particularly loved the Tom Waits thing... I enjoyed it, I was never bored.|Fresh
It's a good movie - better than good - and if you like the Coen Brothers, you should enjoy it, and if you don't like the Coen Brothers, why don't you? You really should like the Coen Brothers.|Fresh
Whichever type of Coen film you prefer, there's a bit of that to be found here. Kazan and Nelson are best in show, though it's the shifting tone that's the true focus here.|Fresh
The results overall feel like riding a rickety wooden rollercoaster, where one wrong bump could send the whole thing crashing down, but put your arms up anyway and enjoy the ride|Fresh
More so than usual, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs sees the Coen Brothers toying with audience expectations, resulting in a film that is all over the map and always completely unpredictable.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is reliant on life and fate's brutal eccentricities...while incorporating and morphing the reverberations of the Western genre with the Coen brothers' oddball humor.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is whimsical, fantastical, hilarious, melancholic, and often brutally violent ...|Fresh
So the results are mixed in that Buster Scruggs is considered a feature film, and thus the anthology episodes should be taken individually rather than cohesively.|Fresh
As far as I can tell, these shorts have as much in common with the wearied soul of Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) or the playful, haphazard Hail, Caesar! (2016) as they do with the Coens' genre exercises.|Fresh
Director of photography Bruno Delbonnel's luminous work here is the film's biggest asset, shafts of sunlight, pale faces, nighttime snowfall and verdant valleys glowing on the screen.|Fresh
It's the sort of impressionistic pastiche, the tweaking of iconic Americana, that defines so much of the Coens' best work. The other chapters have their moments|Fresh
No horse better demonstrates being above the nonsense of mankind than Franco's. It watches with the aloofness and bored disinterest of a spectator. How exactly a horse can truly appear impassive, I don't know exactly, but this one does.|Fresh
In [this film the Coens] haven't just made a funny, sentimental, exciting and blistering western, they've also unlocked their entire filmography for anyone who may have missed the connections before.|Fresh
As the Coens remind us, with their usual impish wit and impeccable craft, there's still a lot of pleasure to be mined from those conventions. But there are lessons to be learned, too.|Fresh
Strikes me as mid-to-upper range Coen fare... [Includes] their extraordinary jeweler's-eye attention to detail, their gift for concocting dialogue in plummy 19th-century vernacular, their lyrical embrace of wide-open landscapes, and their woeful nihilism.|Fresh
As a whole Buster Scruggs is too often like a gunfighter firing nothing but blanks.|Rotten
Seems like a lark at first, but taken in totality actually gets to the core of who the Coen Brothers are as storytellers.|Fresh
All of the episodes, in fact, have a perfect yet desolate closing sting.|Fresh
John Ford, Sergio Leone, John Huston, even Republic Pictures' Herbert J. Yates ride again-albeit, in a quirky Coen Brothers kind of way.|Fresh
"This is the sort of film that traditionally marks the start of an artist's ""late phase"" - one in which old motifs are brought back in different keys and tested, and in which the bounds of realism are loosened. For the Coens, it's a thrilling new frontier."|Fresh
The uneven quality of the vignettes aside, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is still a suitably Coenesque jaunt through the merciless trails of the American West.|Fresh
"Consistency isn't always there, but ""Scruggs"" is pure Joel and Ethan Coen, and that always offers something fascinating, even when they get lost in their own creation."|Fresh
[It] can be thought of as a Coen brothers concept album. It works just fine in sequence, but some tracks... only need to be played once.|Fresh
This Western, told in six very different chapters, feels like a mirror reflecting the Coen Brothers' filmography. Uncompromising, wildly funny, morally definitive and often deeply moving, not all of it works. But when it does, watch out.|Fresh
Ballad may not be a TV series, but if the Coens wanted to open that fake book back up and spin some more yarns, more episodes would be welcome.|Fresh
Using their great ability with comic dialogue, the Coens exaggerate and subvert familiar western tropes to gleeful comic effect.|Fresh
Saddle up for a hilarity-and-hellfire, Coen brothers western full of riding, fighting, hanging and shooting - plus silly songs, a limbless poet, cowboy love rituals and philosophical musings about the inevitability of dying.|Fresh
In the movie's most memorable storylines, the filmmakers appear to be working through some sort of problem in their, and our, relationship to the mythology of the American West.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is another classic from the minds of the Coen Brothers.|Fresh
The Coen Bros. are back to familiar landscapes (the Old West), familiar themes (death, nostalgia, cruelty), and familiar styles (self-indulgent, self-congratulatory humor) in the six-short-story film.|Fresh
The Coens take another crazy concept and make it work with a series of stories that will amuse, shock, and even bring tears to your eyes.|Fresh
'Buster Scruggs' is diverting, amusing, but hit has and miss moments. Mark it as a good but minor work from the Coens.|Fresh
A delirious opening followed by a much slower string of episodes, watchable in its ambling, petering out sort way but not one of the Coens' best.|Fresh
There is undoubted power and entertainment in these stories, a harkening back to the quintessential American genre that manages to also play with and undercut its own myth-making power.|Fresh
The film's six parts, reportedly written over the entire breadth of the Coens' career, are unconnected by plot or tone, but they play off each other like tracks on a country concept album.|Fresh
A slightly unbalanced piece, this still features all the black humour, brutal violence, and gorgeous imagery we've come to expect from the Coen Brothers.|Fresh
"Fans of the Coen Brothers' work will be thrilled with ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" as it offers so many varieties on what they do well. It regularly jumps between moments of loquacious absurdity to dusty existentialism."|Fresh
Hilarious in places, unsettling and dark in others, visually stunning, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is pure enjoyment.|Fresh
Even the spottier moments are enlivened by the Coens' knack for myth-spinning, ably assisted by Carter Burwell's eclectic, evocative score.|Fresh
The title story is magnificently entertaining.|Fresh
The film remains patchy and rather disparate, but only by the Coens' standards. At the level they're currently at, it's impossible for them to make a bad film. If we're simplifying fractions, then The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is half a great one.|Fresh
With all the clashing of styles and moods, Buster Scruggs is like a digest of the Coen brothers' entire opus, currently in its fourth decade of excitedly exploring one genre after another.|Fresh
At the end of the journey we're left laughing through the lump in our throat.|Fresh
A Wild West movie all about white men, where Native Americans only appear onscreen to scalp people and get shot in the head? Groundbreaking.|Fresh
The beautiful cinematography and rousing musical score are excellent throughout.|Fresh
It offers as much satisfaction as an unstable advent calendar. There's definitely something sweet behind every door, but it rarely tastes as fun as it looks.|Fresh
Another great entry by the Coen brothers -Lauren Humphries-Brooks|Fresh
An unconventional masterpiece.|Fresh
While it's stuffed with charming stars, colorful characters, and tales of life in the Wild West, this cowboy collection is clunky, indulgent, and ultimately underwhelming.|Rotten
The Coens' love of westerns is well established and each of the stories is impeccably crafted...|Fresh
"""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" finds the enthusiasm in its provocative personas. Each person, grossly unique yet commonly familiar, the movie stimulates the viewer for its boisterous moments and subdued notes."|Fresh
Yet another piece of Coen Brothers' gold that just makes me curious about what kind of magic they're going to make next.|Fresh
Distilling the finest and most absurd tenants of the Western genre and the most indulgent concessions to the Coens' idiosyncratic filmmaking yet, the film is not just the most essential film in the brothers' catalogue.|Fresh
A few sharp one-liners seem to be anchoring a meandering story that, however beautifully filmed, fails to linger in the mind, dissipating quickly like all that gunsmoke.|Rotten
Like most omnibus projects, the results are something of a mixed bag, though the peerless craftsmanship lends the whole project a certain cohesiveness.|Fresh
While among the other five shorts in the piece there are also gems (as well as a few pieces of fool's gold), the picture never quite overcomes how strong the first short was.|Fresh
Joel and Ethan Coen have made an anthology of witty, off-kilter stories of the old west that thrive on ambience, dialogues, and imagination.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs plays out as a tribute to the flexible nature of the western setting, which can accommodate comic vignettes, grim irony, gallows humour and even chilling, Gothic yarns set on a dark, misty night.|Fresh
These stories are all stingingly well told, with the snap and brio that comes so easily to the Coens, often dreadfully funny too.|Fresh
Once it's time to switch tones, the Coens don't seem to have much to say other than pointing to the well-documented fact that the American frontier was a violent place.|Rotten
The good outweighs the bad and ultimately it's no fool's gold, even if it's not quite 24-carat (or should that be carrot?).|Fresh
A ravishing if wildly uneven addition to the Coens' catalogue.|Fresh
Its meshing of formal discipline and screwed-down content sometimes give it the sense of a work that has been carefully and elaborately embroidered rather than photographed.|Fresh
Buster Scruggs is a singular illustration of what makes the Coen formula so appealing, and a reminder of so many better examples.|Fresh
Richly entertaining and blackly funny but told with sincerity and heart, the half-dozen Western tales packed into The Ballad of Buster Scruggs show the Coen brothers loading up their six-shooter and firing barely a blank.|Fresh
Despite the snark and irreverence, genre specialists will eat up the devotion to detail here, from the relish the Coens take in writing colorful 19th century Western vernacular to the musical choices and the lovely between-acts artwork.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs itself - is a gonzo send-up of the now cataclysmically uncool singing cowboy genre...|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is storybook lore, enjoyable in the way we always enjoy tall tales that have been handed down from one generation to the next. But it's also laced with melancholy.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a pop fantasia that's interested in the meaning of what a brutal place the Old West really was.|Fresh
The six tales collected in the dusty old hardback book The Ballad of Buster Scruggs... are packed with originality, poetry and glorious wit.|Fresh
This is a handsomely made picture, with a richly plausible musical score by Carter Burwell; it is an old-school western in many ways and if there is something comic or self-satirising about it, this doesn't mean it is pure pastiche.|Fresh
This is a film about America... one filled with scenes of bloody vengeance, religious zealotry, romantic idealism, slick salesmanship, incoherent ramblings and sunny optimism. It's absolutely glorious.|Fresh
As Netflix binges go, it's a pretty good one, but be ready to love some episodes more than others.|Fresh
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs has to be chalked down to a perplexingly minor addition to one of the most beloved cinematic canons of our time.|Fresh
