The lovely, terrible final image... is as heartbreaking in 1988 as it was a half century ago.|Fresh
So magnificent, so powerful, that it hardly behooves mere words to tell of its heart-rending appeal, of its dramatic fire, its breath-taking battle shots in which men stab and kill each other, for the glory of war.|Fresh
The despair-and the artistry-is breathtaking.|Fresh
From such grisly materials the popular cinema is rarely drawn. The film is monumental in the courage that risked its manufacture.|Fresh
A harrowing, gruesome, morbid tale of war.|Fresh
Deserves its reputation as a classic.|Fresh
Lewis Milestone's groundbreaking war film is up with La Grande Illusion as one of the finest humanitarian antiwar movies ever made.|Fresh
The performances are haunting.|Fresh
It not only seeks to straddle the high dramatic of the silent era with the more staid aesthetics of the sound era, but it seeks to reveal wartime horror to such a heart-wrenching degree that it will undo war altogether.|Fresh
The performances are also exemplary, but it is primarily a film of great moments -- the climactic sequence of the young conscript reaching out for a butterfly in the sun -- that, once seen, are never forgotten.|Fresh
The production values are incredibly high and not just for the time. And as the movie has aged and the film has gone grainier and the flickers increased, it almost adds to the effect.|Fresh
[A] fascinating, innovative early talkie.|Fresh
The rawness of the audio eradicates any lingering notion that war is romantic or exciting, and at times suggests the very battered eardrums of those engaged in combat.|Fresh
Took an opportunity to question warfare and its civility long before the war protest film became popular in the 70s. It's dated, obviously, but still powerful.|Fresh
|Fresh
A movie of timeless relevance and effects. Lew Ayres would never again equal his performance in this film version of the well-known anti-war novel.|Fresh
Classic anti-war epic tells dire, exhausting tale.|Fresh
Despite a little dating around the edges this is a truly superb example of its genre and a cinema classic.|Fresh
A film that remains one of the most powerful screen comments on the horrors of war.|Fresh
Vivid and consistently involving, this version of Erich Maria Remarque's pacifist novel perfectly distills the waste and horror of war.|Fresh
The film made Ayres a star.|Fresh
...a bitter indictment of the insulated powers that induce naive young men to kill one another.|Fresh
An ambitious epic of tremendous sweep and scope.|Fresh
This uncompromising drama makes a bleak statement of war fighting in trenches, stressing the inanity of WWI (or any war) for both sides; perhaps the most memorable moment is the one in which Lew Ayres reaches out for a butterfly to disastrous effect.|Fresh
There are few war films that can match the brilliance of Lewis Milestone's anti-war classic. It's a feast for the ears with a passionate soul.|Fresh
The film's strength now derives less from its admittedly powerful but highly simplistic utterances about war as waste, than from a generally excellent set of performances (Ayres especially) and an almost total reluctance to follow normal plot structure.|Fresh
Heavy stuff, especially for 1930.|Fresh
|Fresh
Classic early talkie is still anti-war effective.|Fresh
A Classic and then some|Fresh
Classic anti-war drama|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
The horrific immediacy of the battle scenes remains unsurpassed and even though the discussions on the purposes, causes and effects of war now seem laboured and stagy, they still have power and cogency.|Fresh
One of the most effective pacifist arguments ever committed to celluloid. It is a torturous vision of death devoid of glory.|Fresh
|Fresh
A gripping, disturbing, emotionally affecting movie about the loss of innocence and idealism.|Fresh
Messrs. Milestone, Abbott and Anderson in this film have contributed a memorable piece of work to the screen.|Fresh
Classic anti-war early talkie lives up to its reputation.|Fresh
One of the great war-is-folly epics.|Fresh

All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) is the first major anti-war film of the sound era, faithfully based upon the timeless 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque.|Fresh
With no focus on one or even a handful of characters, Quiet is strangely uninvolving until it begins to concentrate on young Paul Baumer.|Fresh
Perhaps the greatest antiwar film ever made.|Fresh
All Quiet on the Western Front is the definitive World War I motion picture, the best of a surprisingly small class of movies.|Fresh
