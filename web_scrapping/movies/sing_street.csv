Sing Street is not an especially important movie that will long be remembered, but its virtues make it an enjoyable viewing experience.|Fresh

Sing Street has the hair of the 80s, but a timeless heart.|Fresh

With a great cast, soundtrack and a tender soul, Sing Street deserves to be an enduring antidote to nostalgia, a giant of modern Irish cinema.|Fresh

It feels like Carney's characters are finally getting the fate they deserve, and that's not just a demo tape and career prospects.|Fresh

Love the film, buy the soundtrack, paint your nails, put some blusher on and fall in love for the first time, again.|Fresh
"Exuberant in a winningly ramshackle way, this is the cinematic equivalent of a classic disposable pop song and - as Noel Coward pointed out - it's ""strange how potent cheap music is...""​"|Fresh
Cornily heart-warming, it's an absolute delight and a welcome relief from the shock and bore of the typical multiplex blockbuster.|Fresh
Carney seems to be viewing his imagined world with both sepia and rose tints, yet the result is still, with sufficient suspension of disbelief, sweetly enjoyable.|Fresh

Like a tie-in soundtrack album in search of a movie.|Rotten

Carney's best work to date, smoothly merging his storytelling and jukebox obsessions. Even with a few rocky moments, it all works with irresistible confidence.|Fresh
