It's a blatantly handcrafted film that's overall obvious and muddles its message ... but skates by on its unique charm and earnest message (ultimately a more militant one, amen).|Fresh
That's the brilliant thing about Sorry to Bother You: it's a multi-layered statement about our current social & political climate - and it's also really, really, REALLY funny.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You mixes biting socio-political satire and excellent performances from a varied cast with outlandish imagery and imaginative direction.|Fresh
An insane piece of social satire for an era that's losing its mind in real time, and it's one of the best films of 2018.|Fresh
It's smart and weird, a philosophical car crash of a modern-day fable filled with thoughtful ideas and dark jokes and magical realism - the kind of movie that dares you to categorize it because it knows you can't.|Fresh
A hilarious, intelligent, and socially relevant satire of American business and capitalism, and hands-down one of the best films of 2018.|Fresh
Sorry To Bother You is not just a film about code-switching and upward mobility in a corporate structure. It is a film that comments on the dangers of capitalism and how one could lose themselves trying to keep up with the Joneses.|Fresh
Even if the deadpan humor doesn't always triumph, there is some mordant social commentary expressed with a satirical posture, which sort of replaces it.|Fresh

One of the best debut feature films from a first time writer-director you will ever see.|Fresh
You can have interesting ideas and creative storytelling methods but if it is presented in a maddening, chaotic way than we leave feeling frustrated more than inspired.|Rotten
The acting is effective and the story moves right along. Director and writer Boots Riley has produced a wonderful screenplay and an extremely impressive debut film.|Fresh
Like Sergio Aragones scrawling cartoons in the margins of Mad magazine, Riley fills the frame with more jokes and ideas than can be apprehended in one viewing; the result is a film that teems with and celebrates life, even in the context of a dystopia.|Fresh
This comedic dig at capitalism and broken race relations mixes the sweet with the sour, the silly with the serious.|Fresh
Anchored by his working-class angst, Riley takes broad aim at the slippery target of 21st-century capitalism, that hydra-headed dynamo with its endless powers of absorbing dissent and selling it back to the disaffected masses as neutered heroism.|Fresh
The African-American perspective that runs so powerfully through this work is the essential component that gives it its battle cry. Norma Rae gets its shoutout, but that was then. Sorry to Bother You and the saga of Cassius Green is our now.|Fresh
This outrageous film is a frenzy of social satire that's as disheveled as it is provocative, and it's a strong, audacious effort from a fresh and progressive new voice in cinema.|Fresh
Wildly visually explosive and supremely confident...|Fresh
While Sorry to Bother You is off-the-wall and hilariously bizarre, its message is firmly grounded in the recognisable injustice of a system whose decadence is seeing it teetering on the edge of collapse.|Fresh
The delightful and assured cast lead the story with complete control through its craziest moments, and this dystopian madness is utterly believable in their capable hands.|Fresh
While it's very much a first film, replete with narrative digressions and some big swings that don't quite land, it's bursting at the seams with creativity, big ideas and several standout turns.|Fresh
a deliriously entertaining and viciously bizarre satire of the logical ends of capitalism, corporate culture, race relations, and ethics-free technological and biological advancement|Fresh
This movie, the directorial debut of rapper and activist Boots Riley, explores the racial, class and financial gulfs of human society. It does so in a way that is bizarrely funny and awkwardly confronting.|Fresh
Riley builds on the history of satirical cinema to tell a sharply contemporary fable that critiques the related inequities of race, class and unionised labour.|Fresh
It's almost too much, like sitting in a Marxist theory class after a night of hallucinogens, but Riley's wide-awake writing slots everything together around a beautifully twitchy performance from Stanfield.|Fresh
Boots Riley...delivers a social comedy that is satirical, surreal and, thankfully, at times very funny indeed.|Fresh
Visually and tonally, Sorry To Bother You is a one-off, and hopefully heralds the arrival of an unorthodox new talent. The relentless fizz of absurdism might be too much for some palates, however.|Fresh
It's broad, brash, in your face, inventively shot and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny yet it also becomes a mind-bogglingly extreme Swiftian satire that predicts the Houyhnhnms that our harsh times will create.|Fresh
Riley, here making his feature debut as a writer-director, has some clever ideas, but as satire Sorry to Bother You is too obvious to succeed.|Rotten
Pinballing frenetically between amusement, absurdity and anger, this is an unruly piece which takes pointed pot-shots at coercive capitalism before galloping toward an impressively unhinged third act.|Fresh
Its swagger and sheer brazen weirdness is to be admired, commended and revelled in because we just don't get films like this very often.|Fresh
This is the kind of film that gives me hope for the human race.|Fresh
It starts promisingly and becomes wackily incoherent, but the very least you can say about it is that it's not short of ideas.|Fresh
While it's inevitably disappointing to watch this hot mess fly off the handle the way it does, the movie's ideas have an odd way of sticking even when the delivery method stalls.|Fresh
It's... a mark of Riley's sheer narrative chutzpah that the film never feels didactic as it crams a semester's worth of radical politics into its swift 100-minute running time.|Fresh
It is an honourable mess.|Rotten
A magnificently whack, utterly unclassifiable shot across the bow of both indie cinema and the crapsack world that is America in 2018.|Fresh
What we're left with is a bizarre, angry and surprisingly disorganised film that prioritises themes over storytelling. Pity.|Rotten
Busy, boundless and brilliantly bonkers, this is the madcap Marxist adventure comedy you need to see right now.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is unapologetically of the moment, and yet is a madcap, gonzo masterpiece that we will still be talking about in twenty-plus years.|Fresh
Riley never once loses control. He sticks to the script. And the result is a triumph.|Fresh
This palpably handmade movie doesn't reach out, and nor does it engage in chin stroking: instead, it extends a middle finger.|Fresh
A film full of cleverness and good ideas.|Fresh
Stanfield has a heroic lightness and calm.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is a wake-up call to the uncomfortable truth that the world we already live in may be the real dystopia. A little movie with a mighty punch.|Fresh
A tiny crazy time capsule of everything wrong with our current society.|Fresh
By the time the scream-gasp-and-giggle sci-fi climax arrives, we've lost interest in what happens to this hero or to this smug, undercranked movie.|Rotten
Movies this original don't come along very often, especially ones that are this good at pushing buttons.|Fresh
Stanfield effortlessly negotiates the crazy tone, engaging you so fully you want to marry him. It's a match made in movie heaven and this is one of the standout films of the year.|Fresh
The mixture of social commentary, quasi science fiction and farce makes it hard to categorise. It also bites off way more than it can chew, but is so full of attitude and anarchy that resistance seems futile.|Fresh
No fence-sitting here, Sorry To Bother You wallops its targets. Drenched in self-awareness, it is fantastically refreshing, defiantly announcing Riley as a radical new voice.|Fresh
With this startling and hilarious film, rapper-turned-film-maker Boots Riley brings back a kind of satirical edge that has been sorely missing from American cinema.|Fresh
One-part dystopian satire, one-part Faustian-morality tale, but mostly a hard-edged comedy/horror set in a world so absurd, it might just be the truth. Hugely recommended.|Fresh
Riley's trippy, frequently hilarious and extremely original Oakland-set fantasia is an urgent, cohesive and accessible statement on race in America masquerading as the best episode of The Twilight Zone you've never seen.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You, the directorial debut of musician Boots Riley, is a black comedy that's no joke, a fantasy about a future dystopia that's too real, and a satire so ferocious it'll leave visible bite marks on your person.|Fresh
The film is for Boots Riley what Reservoir Dogs Was for Tarantino: a rain of references that return us to the cinema in its purest form which gives to that spectacle a depth corresponding an inspired political discourse. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU Challenges, Unnerves, and Delivers|Fresh
The awkwardness in Riley's filmmaking suits the mood, but while there are brilliantly sharp moments - particularly Cassius' improvised rap to wealthy partygoers - there are misses too. The narrow tone also leaves a hint of inertia, despite the broadsides.|Fresh
An absurdist comic gem that starts off playfully odd before pushing you off a cliff with its off-the-wall weirdness.|Fresh
It is a crafty piece of insanity that resonates in its stinging commentary that skillfully tackles the perception of race, corporate crookedness and the conflict of embracing ill-gotten financial rewards that come at a costly price of one's moral compass.|Fresh
...a hodgepodge capitalist critique filled with hijinks...|Fresh
"Sorry to Bother You is a mind-blowing, frenetic, visual trip that will have you silently mouthing ""what the fuck"" several times during its run-time and it's one of the most original films to come out in 2018."|Fresh
Its high-concept satire may not land every bizarre flourish it skyrockets at us, but Sorry to Bother You's wit is both profound and satisfyingly off-the-wall.|Fresh
Sorry To Bother You challenges the way audiences conceptualize their lives, what they value, and pushes them to define their moral line.|Fresh
Seeing Lakeith Stanfield's lackadaisical mystique dominate a lead role is a joyous experience.|Fresh
A rollercoaster ride of original, cinematic grandeur that will shock reserved audiences and invigorate viewers looking for fresh perspectives.|Fresh
Possessed of manic energy like everyone involved thought they'd never be allowed to make another one after this so they'd better get it all out of their system this time. A brain-melting yet spirit-cleansing blast of righteous originality.|Fresh
It's Brazil meets Black Mirror meets Do the Right Thing in equal measure.|Fresh
There is satire and then there is what Riley tries to do in Sorry to Bother You, which is to take that humor so far that it doesn't push the boundaries - it completely destroys them.|Rotten
Not only is this movie loaded with amazing acting, especially from Lakeith Stanfield, but it's filled with scenes that are equal parts out-of-this-world and incredibly relevant.|Fresh
Boots Riley's Sorry to Bother You contains an excellent cast and a narrative that presents some fascinating ideas, but it's ultimately undone by a wild shift into fantasy in the second half that unfortunately makes for an unsatisfying experience overall.|Rotten
As mad and chaotic as the times we live in, it proves that laughter and hope go hand in hand.|Fresh
I'm not sorry I bothered, I had a pretty good time, but was left dazed and unfulfilled after all was said and done.|Fresh
The combination of committed performances and inspired magical realism lends the film a wild and frantic energy that explodes to unexpected ends in the final throes.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is a promising debut for Boots Riley - it's visually staggering and frequently funny, making up in laughs what it loses in terms of hard hitting socio-political commentary.|Fresh
Just how joyous is it - just how life-affirming, even with satire as dark and urgent as this - when a lightning bolt of a film like this comes along?|Fresh
An audacious if messy and sometimes overly broad satire of race, capitalism and workplace politics in modern America.|Fresh
[The movie] is a great ambitious feature. It doesn't hit all its targets fully, but in aiming for the stars, it lands on some resonating and important clouds, so to speak.|Fresh
The world is going to go mad (in a good way) for this wickedly original and creative thrill ride.|Fresh
It doesn't happen often, but every once in a while, a film comes along that's unlike anything you've ever seen.|Fresh
Tackles racism and cultural appropriation effectively with satire. Powerful stuff from a fresh new voice in cinema, Boots Riley.|Fresh
It is extremely unlikely you will see a film with vision, creativity, and style in the way you see it here.|Fresh
Sorry To Bother You [is] doubly exciting: it's conscious of what it achieves in its absurdity, just as much as it's conscious of the dangers of late-stage capitalism.|Fresh
Soon enough the logic of maximal profit infiltrates every crevice of human life, including the human body. To say more is to spoil the surprise-and the last third of the movie is a wild ride.|Fresh
We haven't seen a mainstream pro-union film since, uhhhhhhh . . . Matewan in 1987? That fact alone makes Sorry to Bother You a riveting experience.|Fresh
One of the most interesting components in Sorry To Bother You is whether the film does, or doesn't, and how it goes about testing his basic humanity.|Fresh
LaKeith [Stanfield] is a good actor, he has a lot of range, and I enjoy his work. Tessa Thompson killed it. She's a very interesting character.|Fresh
I'm conflicted...I want to promote originality, and unique voices, and I'd love to see what Boots Riley does next...|Fresh
A lot of the comedy fell short...the third act was a little too crazy for me, and the ending wasn't strong enough.|Rotten
Sorry to Bother You is an energetic original, both strikingly timely and sadly timeless in its riffs on what ails us all, and how racism makes everything so much worse.|Fresh
He expertly uses the havoc and excess, first lulling you into familiar territory before upending all expectations and taking you on one headtrip of an indictment of capitalism.|Fresh
It is perhaps not for all tastes but is also one of the most original, fearlessly creative productions you're likely to see this year.|Fresh
Everything needs to be seen to be believed because Riley goes beyond the kitchen sink to aim for the jugular where his message, irreverence, and karmic payback is concerned.|Fresh
Some art reaches above its influences to create a unique vision. Boots Riley's Sorry to Bother You is one such piece of art.|Fresh
Goes from promising to less promising, as things are no longer funny as it departs the real world for a creepy unreal sci-fi one.|Fresh
Stylish, bold, original, and more fearless than most films are today, Sorry to Bother You offers more style than substance for it's satirical aspects tackle way more topics than it can handle.|Fresh
The injustice and dread at the core of the movie is overwhelming -- in the same way so many feel overwhelmed by it every day in real life.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is a trip. A wonderful trip but a trip. So pack your expectations accordingly.|Fresh
I'm sorry I bothered. The comedy is not just lame, it's ringing with lameness, wearing out trite gags that were stale to begin with.|Rotten
Riley has a great deal to work with here, not the least of which is a stellar cast.|Fresh
Every so often a film comes along that seems to march to a different drum than the rest of what Hollywood has to offer. A film that swims upstream, in a good way.|Fresh
Funny, strange, confrontational and subversive, Sorry To Bother You is one of the most interesting experiences you'll have at the cinema this year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It feels like Riley approached making his movie like making a concept album. Sorry To Bother You has three parts to it and loves to change tone, genre, and plot to an extent, in a flavourful way that keeps you entertained.|Fresh
"The fact that the abyss between modern society and the ""loqueras"" of the film is not so great gives dramatic urgency to the black and cynical humor that distinguishes this production. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
A gleaming signpost of an attention-worthy filmmaker that we didn't know we had. Now we know.|Fresh
It's like Get Out with a touch of BoJack Horseman.|Fresh
"Brilliant and off the wall, ""Sorry to Bother You"" is this year's ""Repo man."""|Fresh
If the head-trip films of the 1960s had a fling with Mike Judge's Idiocracy and spawned a progeny as anarchically scattershot as it is brilliantly sincere, the result might look like this.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is a godsend.|Fresh
Though the inventive visual style and narrative absurdity will remind you of other filmmakers, Boots Riley's playful, rabble-rousing story is unique - warts and all, pretty impressive for a first-time filmmaker.|Fresh
The ideas are big and the creativity invigorating, with stories of transformation that are specific to Oakland yet universally resonant.|Fresh
A damning portrait of things as they are in the US, this movie's accurate and wild version of the present moment is Brechtian-alienated, sardonic, and disreputable.|Fresh
"Even as it's going off the rails, ""Sorry to Bother You"" remains a remarkably assured, focused and provocative piece of filmmaking."|Fresh
By going off on so many tangents, the satire loses focus and force.|Rotten
There's no film more scathingly clear-eyed about America in 2018, and you need to see it right now.|Fresh
I wanted to like it more than I actually did... But much of the humor totally escaped me and I walked out only mildly impressed.|Rotten
"Want to laugh, be shocked, ask ""WTF?"" and contemplate our dark future? You should bother to see this movie."|Fresh
We find ourselves wanting to call out the outlandish bullshit, but the more crazy and frazzled the story becomes, the more it feels like a sad and all-too accurate reflection of our current reality.|Fresh
Indeed, smuggled inside Riley's rollicking mashup of surrealism and sci-fi is a cutting critique of race and class.|Fresh
And here is a movie that condescends to no one, and which pretends to almost nothing - looking at our world and rendering a just-slightly distorted vision that illuminates it keenly.|Fresh
The movie misses almost as often as it hits, but when the big swings land they leave a mark.|Fresh
I'm sorry that I didn't love you, 'Sorry to Bother You'.|Rotten
It's one of the most original films you'll likely see all year, which, depending on your threshold for certifiably crazy storylines, could be a rewarding experience or one that frustrates you.|Fresh
The beauty of Sorry to Bother You is the juggling act. It balances direct, in-your-face Mel Brooksian satire with more hyperlocal, Oakland (and Bay Area) centric moments that reward various levels of well-worn cultural sommeliers.|Fresh
The best part of Sorry To Bother You is that it feels unlike anything else, an almost DIY labor of love... with a message that packs a punch. Sometimes it's messy, and it's often weird, but it's always riveting.|Fresh
[It] taps into a glorious cinematic history, joining the ranks of films like Dr. Strangelove, Network, Fight Club, and Being John Malkovich as satirical touchstones that define an era of American history.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is that rarest of satires - a nimble, imaginative, non-clichéd bucket of socially aware indignation that doubles as a street-level panorama of the 21st-century urban experience, Oakland style.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You works on so many different levels. It's a trenchant, timely satire about race relations, labor relations, late capitalism and much more.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is wild and over-the-top. But like all good satire, the paths it takes are still recognizable. Boots Riley is always pointing the finger right back at us.|Fresh
By time the film flashes its title at the end of its closing credits, it's almost as if it's saying those words to its audience. It's up to you to determine if it's a biting barb, or an apologetic epilogue.|Fresh
It has an energy, a punk spirit, and an originality all its own. I can see it becoming the kind of film that plays to raucous crowds at midnight showings on college campuses.|Fresh
A unique vision that unfolds in the WILDEST manner.|Fresh
An outrageous and uncompromising assault on capitalism, consumerism, racism and other unpleasant -isms that have come to define these United States of America.|Fresh
A purposeful exercise in discomfort and painful soul-searching. And it works.|Fresh
Certainly 'Bother' presents enough pointed satire to get around famously on its own. Maybe Riley can turn all his visionary potential into something just a bit more accessible next time.|Fresh
About as unpredictable a film as you'll see all year and one that certainly starts off promisingly enough. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Smart work, bursting with experimentation, creativity, and vision, but it loses steam as it goes.|Fresh
This impossible to categorize movie starts off as a hilarious satire and then veers into territory so unexpected (and queasy) that it may alienate many. But others will find it a rebellious mess that's difficult to dismiss.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You stands as a comedy that strikes enough targets to make it a welcome attempt to say something about where we actually are - instead of trying to transport us... to places we'd rather be.|Fresh
Not every wild storytelling gamble works and some of the metaphor comes across as heavy-handed as a Trump-Macron handshake. Nonetheless, Riley deserves immense plaudits for taking such risks and making such a powerful statement in his feature film debut.|Fresh
A dark and timely Faustian satire with a first-rate cast.|Fresh
[D]eliciously subversive and unapologetically, righteously militant... be prepared for extremely thoughtful, entertaining, poignant, enraging, laugh-out-loud brilliance.|Fresh
There's a good chance the film will make you laugh out loud, but if it doesn't, there's an even better chance it will make you openly sob.|Fresh
...an ambitious but ultimately ineffective debut endeavor.|Rotten
Caustic, sharp and funny as hell, director Boots Riley's acerbic take on surviving (just) in the contemporary business world assumes its rightful place beside O Lucky Man! And Putney Swope.|Fresh
Riley's dark comedy, which riffs on our substitution of memes for culture and acceptance of reality TV's degradation in exchange for true art, rarely devolves into mere hectoring.|Fresh
"""Sorry to Bother You"" is an uncompromising and timely film of unapologetic brilliance."|Fresh
It is almost distractingly original, even if that overly busy nature also holds it back from five-star greatness. It's as though Riley wanted to make sure he left no stone unthrown.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You, the feature debut of writer-director Boots Riley, and the no-contest wildest comedy of the season, will keep your mind busy for weeks.|Fresh
"An absurdist, startlingly original Molotov cocktail through the pane glass window of Hollywood, ""Sorry to Bother You"" is a riot, the year's craziest comedy and the most demented call to arms in memory."|Fresh
Nothing can prepare you for Sorry to Bother You, a film so unique, intoxicating and bizarre that it not only demands another viewing, but is also forgivable as a satirical comedy where the jokes eventually take the back seat.|Fresh
The story occasionally meanders and the jokes don't always land, but there's an energy and creativity to the film that reminds me of early Spike Lee movies.|Fresh
Goes from agreeably strange to weird to surreal, but its brilliance lies in how it never stops feeling real, genuine, lived-in.|Fresh
Riley is an original voice, and not as undisciplined as he seems; his movie begins in gritty, flippant realism, then pulls us along step by step until it becomes a paranoid fantasy so feverish that it plays almost as a parody of paranoid fantasies.|Fresh
This film is dope as hell.|Fresh
The movie is a mess, an unfettered explosion of ideas one wishes had been more carefully crafted. And yet the ideas that land land like a megaton bomb.|Fresh
It's a comedy with a lot on its mind, to be sure. But what Riley has accomplished with this film is notable because of all the ways it could fall flat but doesn't.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You swings from its heels, and when it hits, it hits hard.|Fresh
A wild, wiggy piece of homegrown, hip-hop surrealism that skewers race, class and capitalism.|Fresh
"While the narrative of ""Sorry to Bother You"" follows an over-familiar arc of ambition, pride, fall, and atonement, the details are hilarious and quite a bit sharper than you may first realize."|Fresh
"The satire works, but only up to a point. Pity they're selling this as the new ""Get Out."" It isn't."|Fresh
The movie is wildly uneven but lively and timely - in its own surreal way (nods to Idiocracy and The Island of Dr. Moreau), it stands as one of the few Hollywood movies to show an awareness of chronic low-wage pressures in our full-employment economy.|Fresh
A politically charged, love-it-or-hate-it, speculative-fiction fantasy that ruthlessly skewers and satirizes the modern age while also being darkly absurdist and brutally funny.|Fresh
Keith Stanfield continues to prove he's a star and Boots Riley delivers an unforgettable feature directorial debut that's oozing with creativity and style, but ultimately the narrative loses focus and fizzles out.|Fresh
A master class in comic outrage, Sorry to Bother You is a cinematic act of bomb throwing that made me laugh and laugh.|Fresh
Riley's film is the eccentric outlier in the new Black cinema: a frenetic comedy with furious rage bubbling just underneath its surface.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You... [is] a declaration that Riley is an important new voice, determined to shake up the status quo.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is bold, messy, and scattershot - qualities that are infinitely preferable to the bland, generic safety preferred by many of today's box office entries.|Fresh
The film makes a home in your brain and the only cure is to see it again. If this is how Boots Riley sees the future forming, we should fear for our lives.|Fresh
Though the film asks its audience to open their minds well past what we understand as traditional storytelling, Riley never leaves us to flounder in confusion. His writing is witty and spot-on, and the brilliant cast packs a punch.|Fresh
"Yo, there's no way for me to review this film without saying, take your *insert ethnicity + ""ass"" here* to see Sorry to Bother You, like now. You have to see it in order to know what you're really messing with."|Fresh
With Sorry to Bother You, filmmaker and musician Boots Riley explores the inherently American natures of both capitalism and dissent.|Fresh
A wildly inventive and righteously angry retelling of an oft-told morality tale.|Fresh
An impassioned, chaotically accurate response to dark and troubling times.|Fresh
If you had to boil the unruly inventiveness of Sorry to Bother You down to one sentence, it could be this: Doing the right thing always involves risk. Get ready.|Fresh
Will at once delight and rattle you to your bones in equal measure.|Fresh
"Best two-word review I've heard this year: ""The ----?"" the woman walking from a packed Friday opening night show of Boots Riley's rich fever scream of an activist workplace comedy... prompted her companion. ""The ----,"" he replied,"|Fresh
In his first feature film, Boots Riley pretty much shreds the script, or several of them. Nothing in this movie happens the way it's supposed to.|Fresh
Suffice to say that Sorry to Bother You is science-fiction used correctly in a sentence. It's mad as hell and it's not going to take it anymore.|Fresh
In all its madness - both in anger and absurdity - Sorry to Bother You develops into a journey that defies classification.|Fresh
It's a gleeful kitchen sink throwback to the satiric, absurdist, wildly inventive indies of the '80s, '90s, and early 2000s...|Fresh
In other words, Sorry to Bother You is a surreal ride.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is so provocative, hilarious and bizarre that it could only come from the mind of Boots Riley.|Fresh
An eerily credible imagining of a U.S. that could be just around the corner.|Fresh
Chaotic and ambitious - a potent, politically-charged parable...|Fresh
The film's uncanny images build in wit and discomfort until they reach nightmarish proportions-an artful metaphor for unrestrained capitalism's natural endpoint.|Fresh
Amid its outrageous premise and uneven execution, the visually inventive satire is laced with relevant and provocative socioeconomic observations, even if the film's lofty ambition sometimes exceeds its grasp.|Fresh
Jarring, horrifying, and darkly comical...Sorry to Bother You is a movie made for our times.|Fresh
Some films are allegories wrapped in a plot; Sorry To Bother You is an honest story, wrapped in the trappings of allegory. And it is a joy to unravel.|Fresh
Sociopolitically charged and boasted by fantastic performances, the film is creatively, technically and narratively superb.|Fresh
It is so daring, it is so ambitious, it is so thrilling and weird and pointed and powerful. I never knew where it was going.|Fresh
Like all the best speculative fiction, the assimilation parable Sorry to Bother You is set in a recognizable world that takes certain elements to their sometimes terrifying conclusions.|Fresh
When it does work, the results are legitimately amazing. And yet, it never quite pulls together into a coherent artistic statement and there are simply too many times when it feels as if it is just being weird for the sake of being weird.|Rotten
Certainly weird, confrontational, wildly satirical, and certainly unique, Sorry to Bother You is one of the funniest, energetic, and best films of the year.|Fresh
On balance, though, writer-director Boots Riley and the risk-taking ensemble cast deliver a unique and offbeat and weird and memorable blend of comedy, fantasy and sci-fi wackiness.|Fresh
It is hilarious, borderline unhinged, and one of the year's best films.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You has so many ideas busting out of every seam, so much ambition, so much it so urgently wants to say, that it feels almost churlish to point out that the movie ends up careening gloriously out of control.|Fresh
Riley's ability to transfer his leftist politics intact from turntable to screen is truly miraculous. His film has a distinct look that ranges from pop-art bright to demonically dark, and Stanfield's lightly absurdist performance holds it all together.|Fresh
Riley has someone say something to the effect that, as soon as people realize a problem has no solution, they adapt by getting used to it. That's haunting.|Fresh
"""...aka How to Succeed in White America Without Really Dying."""|Fresh
High social satire fueled by a sharp understanding of the politics of our time and the human nature of all times.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You takes too long to get to a payoff that's impressively brash but too surreal to function as satire. Yet tightening and focusing the movie's script probably wouldn't have helped.|Rotten
Throughout the politics and pornography, it's Stanfield's miraculously steady performance that keeps the film grounded.|Fresh
"""Sorry to Bother You"" is certainly here to bother, and is not sorry at all."|Fresh
Boots Riley disavows subtlety at every turn, and his movie is better off for this decision-Sorry to Bother You synthesizes the incisive and the ludicrous to yield the funkiest possible allegory. It's a class satire without peer in its decade.|Fresh
"Occasionally juvenile, heavy-handed and gimmicky, ""Sorry to Bother You"" isn't perfect, but it's seldom at its worst. And at its best, it's an entertaining, jacked-up, hypnagogic hike into the darkest chasm between the 1 percent and the rest of us."|Fresh
Riley's film thrums with the energy and unnecessary tics of a filmmaker itching to empty the contents of his imagination into one crazy, not-all-together coherent motion picture.|Fresh
An outrageous satire that swings for the fences - in about 26 different directions - and even if every hit doesn't clear, audiences will know they've seen something provocative, funny, impolite, meaningful and aimed squarely at the 2018 zeitgeist.|Fresh
Riley's approach is far too scattershot for some totality of vision to arrive.|Rotten
The movie is a hilariously unhinged satire, without-and this is the extraordinary part-even a hint of didacticism.|Fresh

"What starts as a clever comedy involving a guy who discovers an edgy superpower, becomes a crazed science fiction film reminiscent of indie cult oddities like Alex Cox' ""Repo Man."" It's all very exciting, at least to me, and I'll bet that I'm not alone."|Fresh

Give it up for the astutely ridiculous workplace satire that, when it comes to cinematic cajones, is nothing if not a horse of a different color.|Fresh

[Boots] Riley's wacky odyssey fires a zillion different wacky ideas at once, and more often than not, hits its targets.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is ambitious and outrageous, but as much as Stanfield is a likeably hapless hero (like an African American version of Brazil's Sam Lowry), the film struggles to give its central characters authentic wants and desires.|Rotten
...bizarre, overly-stuffed satire Sorry to Bother You, which is like Livin' Large, Hollywood Shuffle, and Putney Swope all rolled into one.|Fresh
Sorry to Bother You is the rare 'crazy' movie that actually has something to say.|Fresh
"""You're so captivated by the bizarre plot twists that recognizing the humor becomes secondary."""|Fresh
In terms of its grounding in a recognizable contemporary world, the movie doesn't muster much clarity of vision; it feels more like one long stoner riff than a serious observation of shifting cultural realities.|Rotten
There is just so much movie here. For some it may be too much. But in the same secretly sarcastic way most telemarketers say the phrase, the title of this one is particularly apt.|Fresh
