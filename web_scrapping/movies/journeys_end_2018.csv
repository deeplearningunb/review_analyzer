The period recreation is vivid, especially when the whistle blows and the men climb over the top and into a battlefield strewn with barbed wire, bomb craters and mud-soaked corpses. It's a gruelling drama, yet a worthwhile one.|Fresh

If it's not pacifist, it's certainly a profoundly anti-war statement about men under ultimate stress. One hundred years on, it's never too soon, never too late for that idea.|Fresh
It remains pretty damn powerful even if some of its thunder has been slightly stolen by the mighty army of war movies that have come before.|Fresh
A terrific companion piece (and Armistice Day weekend double bill) to Peter Jackson's similarly set documentary They Shall Not Grow Old.|Fresh

Journey's End is dependent upon the change that comes to the psyche when one's life is literally ticking away.|Fresh
It's a visual assault of the most important senses - heart and mind. A must see.|Fresh
"""Journey's End"", is a powerful real-life story about the toll that war can take on a soldier, even when they're not directly on the battlefield."|Fresh
The trenches are insane, but what awaits is worse.|Fresh
These performances dovetail nicely with Dibb's intention to keep us in the soldiers' headspace.|Fresh
Gripping, myopic and brilliantly-acted, if a tad predictable as such WWI films inevitably are.|Fresh
What's more interesting about Journey's End is its detail.|Fresh
The movie is very strong stuff, offering proof that Sherriff's play is unjustly neglected.|Fresh
It's like a handsomely constructed, old-fashioned item of furniture, the sort of well-crafted drama that's fallen out of favor but still captures your admiration.|Fresh
Playing young men facing possible, even probable, doom, the actors are magnificent.|Fresh
Solid performances, especially from stand out Sam Claflin. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director Saul Dibb puts us in the midst of the trench warfare that defined World War I.|Fresh
The gritty visuals mostly liberate the material from its confined roots as a stage play, and the sharp ensemble cast ensures that the emotional impact still resonates a century later.|Fresh
Period war movies may be the only genre left that can plausibly ignore the modern (and justified) demand for diversity; the least such movies can do is reveal the cracks in the fa√ßade of privilege, and Journey's End does so.|Fresh
Director Saul Dibb provides a perfectly pitched retelling, capturing the look and feel of trench warfare and doing most of his filming by candlelight.|Fresh
By keeping us down in the muck, Dibb and company generate an intimacy rare to war films - and especially welcome in a story so rich in characters.|Fresh
Stagy and deliberate in its pacing, the earnest World War I drama Journey's End provides a wonderful opportunity for its cast members to demonstrate some actorly acting.|Fresh
What might have slipped into cliche feels timeless here, thanks to Saul Dibb's taut adaptation and the cast's understated performances. Fear and distraction approaches theatre of the absurd, especially Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot|Fresh
No mere period piece...Like 'Paths of Glory,' 'Journey's End' proves that the lessons taught by one of the most destructive wars in human history remain potent today, at least when as well delivered as they are here.|Fresh
This taut, emotionally wrenching snapshot of both the mythologies and grim realities of war possesses useful reminders about self-deception and abuse of power, especially at a time when bellicose rhetoric and war cabinets seem to be the order of the day.|Fresh
The play wears well, even if its ending is a bit dated ...|Fresh
Contains raw authenticity in both the production design and characterizations that juxtapose both young and old caught up in this hell|Fresh
Journey's End is a distressing examination of how the wait for war is enough to destroy these men's spirits.|Fresh
Nothing happens and everybody talks incessantly.|Rotten
"A necessary antidote to the patriotic gore of ""Dunkirk""."|Fresh
Saul Dibb's World War 1 tale of British soldiers in the trenches is a bleak, sobering experience that puts audiences through a wringer. It's also an emotional powerhouse you will not forget.|Fresh
Journey's End does justice both to the horrors of war and to the spirit that can sometimes, somehow, transcend it.|Fresh
This drama about the first World War is quietly moving as it conveys the horrors of war without heaviness, focusing on humanity and relying little on battle scenes.|Fresh
An intelligent, meticulously crafted drama about British soldiers in the trenches of World War I.|Fresh
Antiwar films don't have to be great to be worthy; this one is very, very good.|Fresh
Exemplary art-house fare.|Fresh
This new film doesn't have a particularly new take on the material. It's Journey's End, told again, and told quite well. So whether or not it will astound you has a lot to do with how familiar you are with the source material.|Fresh
"For a movie based on 90-year-old source material, ""Journey's End"" works remarkably well."|Fresh
A rattling sound design and the cinematographer Laurie Rose's excellent use of low light aren't enough to make the experience immediate.|Rotten
A somber, well-acted WWI drama.|Fresh
Though set at a specific moment in time, the film could be about terminal cancer patients or condemned prisoners, a deeply felt catalog of the behaviors of men who know they're about to die.|Fresh
Is there any artistically compelling reason for the existence of the latest adaptation... Not really, but it's a good play, once again providing juicy roles to fresh and established talent. That'll suffice.|Fresh
Director Saul Dibb has infused his adaptation of R.C. Sherriff's play with a striking sense of urgency.|Fresh
...a brilliant exposition of what life was like in the trenches and the futility of even trying to hope. The battle scenes are excruciatingly realistic...ranks with the best war films of all time.|Fresh
In this earnest expression of horror and fear, it's not just the nerves which are shot to pieces. There's much stiff upper lip talk of putting on a good show. And this very fine British film certainly does just that.|Fresh
Brittle, angry and disillusioned, it's a stunning portrayal of what Stanhope's experience has done to him. It's a revelation from an actor who is clearly capable of a lot more than what we have seen of him.|Fresh
Director Saul Dibb gives the film a remarkable sense of authenticity, with introspective performances from a gifted cast. The film sharply depicts the details of these men as they cope with their situation.|Fresh
When the film's more explosive moments come, Dibb has earned them, partly through the emotional credit accumulated by a uniformly excellent cast.|Fresh
Bettany is seriously good here.|Fresh
Journey's End deserves commendation for its refusal to descend into melodrama; this is not nostalgic period drama, but an unvarnished depiction of organised murder.|Fresh
Powered by memorable performances and Dibb's sobering deconstruction of the individuals who fought for their country, the engrossing Journey's End is a hard-nosed, hard-hitting centennial tribute to Britain's heroes.|Fresh
Journey's End is charged with electricity: I have rarely seen a war film that conveys so powerfully the pained tenderness of comrades, and the insidious creep of fear.|Fresh
Blackadder Goes Forth plays very much like a comic version of the same yarn. It is, nonetheless, worth allowing the old warhorse one more circuit of the track.|Fresh
Still, the play is a solid thing, significant for being one of the original texts in the literature devoted to the war; and it couldn't be filmed much better than it is in Saul Dibb's adaptation, a well-judged movie with an excellent cast.|Fresh
While it clearly has nothing like the budget or visual effects that Steven Spielberg lavished on War Horse, it does have two very important things going for it: perfect timing and a deeply moving authenticity.|Fresh
In the year that we commemorate the centenary of the First World War drawing to a close, Journey's End couldn't be a more timely drama.|Fresh
Sam Claflin is particularly good as the boozy, brooding Captain Stanhope, whose intensity, belligerence and self-loathing flesh out what might in less capable hands have been a cliched, shell-shocked soldier.|Fresh
A fine ensemble cast display various shades of bravery and suffering.|Fresh
One to savour.|Fresh
Think of it as a really, really, little gem.|Fresh
While it's a stretch to believe that only three years separate the world-weary Stanhope and Raleigh, who looks about 14, maybe that's the point. Wars do that to people, then as now.|Fresh
A descent into the muddy trenches of World War I that is intimate and immediate, melancholy and profoundly moving. An experience as visceral as it is intellectual.|Fresh
It is a moving, thought-provoking piece of work that genuinely impresses.|Fresh
The first world war is one of the 20th century's oldest, grimmest tales of futility and slaughter. Dibb and his excellent cast put new passion into it.|Fresh
It's exactly the film you think it's going to be - for better and for worse.|Fresh
This version of Journey's End may not offer any new perspectives into its subject matter but it is made with a commitment and intensity that stop it from ever seeming old fashioned.|Fresh
Director Saul Dibb (Bullet Boy) brings a tense immediacy to this stagey chamber piece.|Fresh
This haunting, sensitive film is another reminder of the futility of war, rendered small-scale and close-up in this instance but with big implications.|Fresh
Claflin and Bettany stand out among an impressive ensemble in a harrowing, powerful WW1 drama well worth enduring.|Fresh
Even if Journey's End will perhaps not be remembered as a classic of the genre, it is nevertheless a well made war film that with good performances that is worth checking out.|Fresh
An outstanding cast savours performing a play that has stood the test of time. Avoiding sentimentality, this is a valuable rejoinder to those who would sugar-coat mass slaughter.|Fresh
Armed with a taut, uncluttered screenplay by Simon Reade and a splendid group of actors, Dibb evokes the terror and misery of the trenches without lapsing into preachiness or sentimentality.|Fresh
Dibb's film at times feels of a piece with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, from the oppressive immediacy of the camerawork to the heavy, droning soundtrack.|Fresh
It's an adaptation that, if not quite a classic, deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the best films to take on the subject.|Fresh
This Journey's End is still a stage play filmed. But it could hardly be filmed better.|Fresh
If there's something holiday-schoolwork-ish about it - very decent, not quite urgent - some wonderfully acted moments carry the day.|Fresh
A genuinely moving and thoroughly affecting piece of filmmaking, which tells a simple story with honesty and commendable reserve.|Fresh
"Few stage staples from 90 years ago would easily translate to the screen today, yet R.C. Sherriff's once near-ubiquitous ""Journey's End"" proves potent as ever in this sturdy new adaptation ..."|Fresh
Nevertheless, Journey's End is a worthy adaptation, offering a sombre psychological depiction of innocence lost.|Fresh
Keep calm and carry on, right past the marquee.|Rotten
A robust, sinewy production that honours the film's enduring themes and proves that it has stood the test of time.|Fresh
