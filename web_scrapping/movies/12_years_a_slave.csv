12 Years a Slave is more important than disturbing. McQueen is unafraid to regard indignity with honesty, which is why his latest film is both historic and ferociously modern.|Fresh
McQueen packs his film with so much identifiable humanity you'll leave sore. Watching 12 Years is a grueling experience, and the artistry of the filmmakers and actors is a generous, pain-diminishing life raft.|Fresh

[12 Years a slave] may be the toughest movie of the year to watch, no matter your ethnicity. The ending is a bittersweet reminder that freedom will never be able to return to Solomon the precious years lost with his family.|Fresh
12 Years is beautifully filmed, with a keen eye toward the conflation of beauty and horror.|Fresh
Capturing the harsh realities of the era, the film is extremely powerful and should be considered essential viewing for everyone.|Fresh
This is not a movie to be enjoyed but endured. But there lies its disturbing genius.|Fresh
Short of actual time travel, 12 Years a Slave is, to date, our best opportunity to bear witness to our inescapable history.|Fresh
Ambitious, honest and horrifying all at once, 12 Years a Slave may not be the easiest film to watch more than once, but it will stay with you forever once you see it.|Fresh
Add the visionary direction by Steve McQueen, the British Turner Prize-winning artist turned film-maker (Hunger, Shame) and you have an out-and-out stunner.|Fresh
But the best sequences in 12 Years a Slave are not history lessons. They are, instead, visually ambiguous and open-ended, presumably owing something to McQueen's art-school background in Britain. . .|Fresh
Ejiofor's performance is typically unshowy yet subtle, conveying a dignity and humanity that the film needs in the face of such unfathomable injustice.|Fresh
It is this film's unfortunate paradox that a story with so much at stake, rendered in what could only be good faith, should translate to so little.|Rotten
McQueen has not only created his finest work to date, but also a potential modern masterpiece.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is a film of searing sincerity and insight, whose central characters are drawn with real complexity. McQueen's third film doesn't just slide slavery under the microscope, it holds it there.|Fresh
Pitiless, heartless and exceptionally intense, 12 Years a Slave is definitely not for the faint-hearted.|Fresh
The end result has momentum and meaning, and slides in amidst McQueen's excellent efforts; the only thing missing, particularly from a director known for his primal jolts and punishing journeys, is the visceral reaction.|Fresh
A significant, necessary piece of work, one that stays with you long after you rise out of your theater seat.|Fresh
12 Years A Slave is essential viewing.|Fresh
A cathartic experience of sorts, 12 Years A Slave achieves something few other films do. It makes you uncomfortable.|Fresh
Through the amazing, appalling story of Solomon Northup, 12 Years a Slave recreates how painfully wicked our country once was.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is more of an important film than a great one.|Fresh
Movies can do a great many things - they can make us laugh, or incite our heroism, or frighten us, or make us cry. '12 Years a Slave' makes us feel, deeply and urgently.|Fresh
There's real rage in this film, the type that can never be assuaged by time or blunted by forgiveness.|Fresh
See this film. Pay homage to the healing truth. A landmark film; would that it could reduce the lag time between genocides and our real-time grasp of their horrifying reality.|Fresh
The end result, while uneven, is appropriately stark, mournful, and gripping, making a deep impression on the landscape of American history on film.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave? It feels much longer.|Rotten
It's a difficult watch, but I heartily recommend you go see 12 Years a Slave, one of the best and most important films you'll see all year.|Fresh
"The power of ""Slave"" is not so much its rote plea to ""not forget,"" but its invitation to understand."|Fresh
12 Years a Slave has too many unforgettable elements, even in its less effective second half for it not to deliver a visceral impact.|Fresh
This movie touches something deep and uncomfortable in our nation's history, something that all of us need to apprehend to truly understand our American heritage.|Fresh
It's Ejiofor who commands our attention, less because of his inherently noble bearing than for his ability to convey the voice of the ordinary man forced to endure inhumanity that left -- and still leaves -- far too many silent.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is an expertly crafted, eerily beautiful film with a clear message and a lot of violence.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave puts things straight -- and some. Anchored by Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance of contained fortitude as Solomon, the film depicts almost unrelenting institutional brutality.|Fresh
McQueen approaches the narrative straight on and sober, with long, long takes bearing the weight of cruelty.|Fresh
We've seen movies about the horrors of slavery before. This one is about the mechanics.|Fresh
It is so fluent and so certain -- both in its humanism and its depiction of institutionalised savagery.|Fresh
We are surely watching one of the transcendent performances of the year in Ejiofor's sensitive, moving portrayal of the miserably oppressed Solomon.|Fresh
Given the subject matter of the film, it's unsurprising to say that 12 Years a Slave is moving, but it's a testament to the filmmaking just how devastating the experience of watching it actually is.|Fresh
The film belongs to Chiwetel and the remarkable ensemble that surrounds him. With McQueen, they've created a landmark picture of devastating power.|Fresh
12 Years A Slave is a powerful, moving and intelligently unsentimental tale that is engrossing and memorable.|Fresh
Easily the most powerful, compelling, devastating, and just plain blunt film about slavery ever made, Steve McQueen's adaptation of Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir, 12 Years a Slave is a raw and searing indictment.|Fresh
Yes, we've all been enlightened unto the depletive hell that was the era of American slavery. But perhaps never, at least through cinema, have we been placed so vividly among the human beings who suffered through it.|Fresh
McQueen depicts the horrific experiences of Solomon Northup, the free man kidnapped and sold into slavery, in utterly unflinching fashion. The film's strength lies in its frankness and avoidance of either sentimentality or Quentin Tarantino-style irony.|Fresh
"12 Years a Slave"" is still one of the best movies of the year. It's also one of the most unsettling."|Fresh
The crux of 12 Years a Slave's power comes back to Chiwetel Ejiofor. What a great, touching, tenacious performance.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is the clearest view of slavery I've seen onscreen.|Fresh
McQueen directs with a total lack of sentiment, crafting each sequence with a merciless forward momentum that compensates for the episodic nature of the narrative.|Fresh
As hard-hitting as this is, though, it's the muted sense of outrage and injustice coursing through every fibre of Solomon's being that lingers longest, ensuring 12 Years a Slave triumphs as a human story about an inhuman institution.|Fresh
The film tells an irresistibly powerful story, in a way that does not shirk the horror. It is unbearable to watch at times, but that is as it should be.|Fresh
The film is beautifully underplayed with an emotional undercurrent that gradually builds an accumulative force, before all of that anger and sorrow finally explodes to the surface in an unforgettable final scene.|Fresh
You will recoil. You will flinch. You will say to yourself, 'Oh no, not again.' But the story will seize you with such a visceral power you will be rooted to the spot. I know I was and I'm not easy to root.|Fresh
Some movies have to be made, have to be seen, and no other consideration needs to be entered into.|Fresh
Watching 12 Years a Slave does not feel like an ethical or educational obligation. While its instructive value is undeniable, this is also a rousing portrait, a morally complicated tale and a masterful work of art.|Fresh
Filled with astonishing, gut-wrenching performances, it brings Northup's stunning story to life in a deeply-affecting way.|Fresh
With enough scope to examine its impact on a community forcibly dehumanized by organized and terrible helplessness, it's a remarkable achievement, brilliantly executed.|Fresh
A film that, despite its surface simplicity, proves to be riven with contradictions to the point of incoherence.|Rotten
Whilst 12 Years may lack the grandiose scale of Amistad, McQueen's ability to extract tension and provide insight into the evil nature of men during a dark period in America's history, makes for compelling viewing.|Fresh
Plain and simple, 12 Years A Slave is a modern day masterpiece.|Fresh
As with Schindler's List, you won't want to be munching a bucket of popcorn through this.|Fresh
Screenwriter John Ridley takes a story that's episodic in nature and crafts a narrative that manages to build in intensity and emotion for over two hours.|Fresh
Driven by the best performances of the year, bold directing, and a compelling true story that reminds us of our nation's shameful, inhumane past, it is a film destined to enjoy a reputation as one of the greatest films ever produced about slavery.|Fresh
This isn't simply an important movie, but a dose of brutal truth that must be confronted, and done so with absolute certainty.|Fresh
Lupita Nyong'o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film.|Fresh
Ejiofor's low-key, naturalistic acting mode is ideal for conveying Northup's self-control and intelligence. And Fassbender avoids turning the malevolent Epps into a one-note nemesis.|Fresh
McQueen works from ferocity to felicity. Scenes of body horror bear higher emotional stakes than your average horror film. It's a film of few kindnesses and many graces.|Fresh
An uncompromising look at slavery in the Antebellum South. Anchored by career-defining performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o, director Steve McQueen brings his assured directorial mind to a harrowing, but necessary picture.|Fresh
There are no false pretenses or unnecessary charging, instead, there is patience and time. The moments of suspension often become the biggest delight.|Fresh
Much of it is difficult to watch, but '12 Years a Slave' is that rare film that's both important in its message and a darned good film all the same.|Fresh
While the praise for 12 Years a Slave has been rather overblown, it's still a recommendable film due to its incredible cast, which helps cover up its weaknesses.|Fresh
This is a truly impressive piece of filmmaking.|Fresh
O que nos torna racistas no  o preconceito que exercemos de maneira ativa, mas a intolerncia contra as mais diversas minorias que simplesmente nos mostramos incapazes de perceber.|Fresh
It's a heavy, depressing film but it's also one that's hard to discredit.|Fresh
McQueen has used this near-documentary style of filming before, but this is the first time it's seemed essential to his story.|Fresh
An unflinching, uncomfortable and entirely necessary modern classic.|Fresh
There is a reason that Slave has topped the best of list of 25 major film critics and won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. Miss it at your own loss.|Fresh
The direction from Steve McQueen is visceral, the script from John Ridley doesn't waste a word, and the performances are, without exception, brilliant.|Fresh
Using dialogue sparsely and shocking images relentlessly, McQueen's movie brilliantly explores the implications and legacy of slavery, and debunks some of its more cherished myths.|Fresh
Minds will be opened, perhaps even changed by what they see (and indeed, feel) here.|Fresh
Fortunately, 12 Years a Slave is not just a minor vanity project for Brad Pitt, who is one of its producers, but also a courageous step forward for director Steve McQueen.|Fresh
The film imparts the casual cruelty of slavery with full force without having to resort to graphic portrayals of on-screen brutality. The film certainly has those, but they are sporadic, well-judged and serve the larger story of a man starved of freedom.|Fresh
12 Years A Slave tackles America's primal sin of slavery with unflinching honesty, leaving in the shade Hollywood's previous efforts to address the subject, from Gone With the Wind's rose-tinted myopia to Django Unchained's gore-and-irony-soaked fantasy.|Fresh
Generally more concerned with making its audience wince than with forging an indelible imprint on the soul.|Rotten
It may well be the greatest film ever made about slavery, but that says more about the movie world than the work itself.|Fresh
In its portrayal of violence and spectatorship, it stays in the mind.|Fresh
McQueen shoots long takes in which the action (as in the emotional action, or intention) is the focus, involving us deeply and meaningfully in the characters, their circumstances and the broader context. The impact is strong.|Fresh
Involving and disturbing with an inspiring central performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor, this is a ballsy film with themes every bit as confronting as those broached by McQueen in his earlier films Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011)|Fresh
The fortuitously named [Steve McQueen] follows up his previous pictures Hunger and Shame with this similarly pit-of-the-stomach venturing, queasy-making drama|Fresh
Ejiofor proves himself a master of physical understatement, the clench of his teeth and slightest parting of the lips speaking volumes.|Fresh
This is a terrifically well-intended and necessarily difficult movie to watch: but I'm not entirely convinced McQueen has delivered quite the masterpiece some would suggest it is.|Fresh
A tale of suffering, endurance, courage and abiding humanity about a freeborn man kidnapped and sold into slavery, which packs all the more wallop for the elegance with which it's made.|Fresh
Ejiofor projects extraordinary integrity, even nobility - and he holds the camera magnificently. It's a deeply inward, deeply felt performance, surely a cert for one of the many Oscars this film must win.|Fresh
"The American South's ""peculiar institution"" has, it seems, become a fit topic for narrative cinema. And it only took a century."|Fresh
This is history alert to the many gradations that inform any fully formed understanding of the past; history unbound.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave proves McQueen's formal prowess and, more significantly, his utter seriousness as a dramatist.|Fresh
Much more than a film about 19th century slavery in America, this sharply well-told true story has a lot to say about the world we live in today.|Fresh
There's little doubt that this painfully authentic adaptation of former slave Solomon Northup's memoir is an important film. But it is not an easy one to sit through.|Fresh
I have seen it twice now, and on both occasions it has managed to enthral and appal in just about equal measure.|Fresh
It does what great cinema should do: takes you on an extraordinary journey and make you feel grateful to be alive.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave isn't simply a masterpiece, it's a milestone. This, at last, really is history written with lightning.|Fresh
Twelve Years a Slave is a magnificent achievement and it is a career best for everyone involved, not least its artist-turned-director, Steve McQueen.|Fresh
The whole film breathes with reality, even while the bayou landscapes are infernalised, surrealised, by a terrible beauty of vision.|Fresh
A flat-out masterpiece, a magnificent, uncompromising and emotionally devastating slavery drama with a superb script, stunning direction and an extraordinary central performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor.|Fresh
One of Britain's greatest living filmmakers offers an outraged, intense and artful examination of American slavery.|Fresh
A relentless, raw and visceral condemnation of a viciously racist regime that condemned its victims to a life of hard labour with random cruelties thrown in and justified by a skewed interpretation of the Old Testament.|Fresh
McQueen's previous films were called Hunger and Shame; there is plenty of both in this almost unwatchably shocking and violent film.|Fresh
The violence is starkly pictured by McQueen, lingering on black skin torn apart to reveal milky white flesh and, of course, red blood.|Fresh
Falling between the twin pillars of the art house and prestige period flick, 12 Years A Slave is history lesson as horror film, powerful, visceral and affecting.|Fresh
Solomon's story doesn't need fictionalising to be absolutely devastating, and McQueen tells it straight, trusting its account, and his actors, to make it resonant.|Fresh
In a film brimming with great performances -- including Fassbender as the ruthless Epps, and Nyong'o's star-making work as the tormented Patsey -- Ejiofor's portrayal of Northup shines.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave remains an important film, if nothing else for the fact that these are not anonymous characters created for Hollywood storytelling, but one man's remarkable story that puts a face on history.|Fresh
These people are presented as they must have seemed at the time, even to themselves; there's no sense of a 21st-century actor sending out subtle I'm-not-really-like-this signals.|Fresh
Ejiofor's performance masterfully walks the line between showing Northrup's unbowed spirit and giving him superhuman levels of fortitude.|Fresh
The film is exactly the sort of thing we mean when we talk about the arts reflecting, ennobling, and strengthening a culture.|Fresh
While Nature/Fate/God can perform apparent wickedness without conscience, neither hold a candle to man.|Fresh
Punishing, relentless, terrible and necessary|Fresh
The year's best film, this drama is a cinematic achievement and will be impossible to forget.|Fresh
"Two hours of torture and degradation were done much better in ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"". This is not a Major Statement about slavery but one about a visual artist's preoccupation with pain--just like his misbegotten ""Hunger""."|Rotten
This is an extraordinary film.|Fresh
I find [McQueen] extraordinary and I thought also what it was really about was the concept of man as a chattel.|Fresh
Shooting the travesties at an artistic remove as if he were observing slavery as a mechanism, McQueen's lush, foreboding compositions don't get in the way of the soul-crushing story.|Fresh
While director McQueen does bring forth an incredible cast of excellent performers to play supporting characters, [this film] belongs to Ejiofor and only Ejiofor.|Fresh
"Assaulted by black and white men and feared by a white woman, exposed in every way, this body lingers in your mind. Signifying so many ""mortifications,"" Patsey reveals to Solomon what he and you must see."|Fresh
So very artfully fiddling while America burns|Fresh
If 12 Years a Slave sounds like a brutal viewing experience then you'd be right, but in eschewing sentimentality and striving for honesty in the storytelling it is also a powerful, essential drama.|Fresh
The power of McQueen's movie is in its declaratory style: This happened. That is all, and that is everything.|Fresh
The feel terrible film of 2013, but for a very good reason|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is an authentic, stunning, and moving work about the darkest reaches of American history.|Fresh
Unflinching, excruciating direction from McQueen; arresting and affective performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o & Michael Fassbender; John Ridley's adaption of this shamefully true story is epic; 12 Years a Slave is extraordinary.|Fresh
One of this year's must-see films, this is not simply a worthy tribute of a subject too often ignored by Hollywood; it's also a remarkable piece of cinema in its own right.|Fresh
Like Steven Spielberg's LINCOLN from last year, and for which this is a good companion piece, this film is required viewing to understand the United States as it was|Fresh
Some movies are 'must-see,' but '12 Years a Slave' goes beyond that to 'deserves to be seen' status. The film, which tells a true story, is a rarity that pulls no punches about the hellishness of slavery.|Fresh
It is a film that necessity and education demand seeing.|Fresh
avoids an easy sense of moralizing and propels us deep into the characters' experiences|Fresh
Through a rich, grueling portrait of the machinery of institutionalized slavery, it asks us to examine the rotten core of slavery and how it permeates our entire culture, not just to ponder life in the 1840s.|Fresh
Horrifying. Riveting. Must see.|Fresh
Slavery has been addressed in films many times before, but I have never seen slavery depicted in the graphic, emotional way it is depicted here.|Fresh
Good, but not as great as it should have been.|Fresh
A decent film, but hardly the breakthrough anti-slavery masterpiece many have claimed. It's difficult to stay in the brutal reality with A-list movie stars around every bend.|Rotten
A remarkably gripping and frank social conscious pic about the horrors of slavery that's earnestly directed by Brit former visual artist Steve McQueen.|Fresh
The film of the decade.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave isn't always easy to sit through, but it is most definitely a vital and profound motion picture.|Fresh
Not only the most powerful movie yet produced about our national shame but also the rare film about history and race that does not seek to absolve, comfort or flatter the mass audience it aspires to reach.|Fresh
All of this goes together to earn 12 Years a Slave a spot at the top of the list for best pictures released this year.|Fresh
With relentlessly calm intensity, it depicts the institution as a machine - a pitiless mechanism that's countered with pitiless direction from filmmaker Steve McQueen.|Fresh
Well, it took a Brit to get the job done, but we finally have it: a nightmare snapshot of plantation life from the viewpoint of an American slave.|Fresh
...meticulously made, sporadically captivating, and yet palpably overlong...|Fresh
The stunning and tragic true story of a free black man sold into slavery in the pre-Civil War South, 12 Years a Slave is guttural, raw, and necessary to the moment, the kind of film that merits critical accolades and industry trophies.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave Devastating and Memorable|Fresh
The closest comparison is Schindler's List, with its immersion into historical tragedy, bringing the unspeakable to discussion. But make no mistake. There hasn't been a movie like this, which is Hollywood's shame. Miss it, and that mistake is yours.|Fresh
Raw emotion manifest...not easily forgotten, as it should be.|Fresh
Ejiofor ... gives a performance for the ages ...|Fresh
Beautifully made and stylish to no end -- even elegant. With an assured hand, McQueen has captured the uncomfortable juxtaposition of natural beauty and unnatural ugliness.|Fresh
The lingering effect is, 'Yeah, these nightmares really happened. People can be horrible. God have mercy.' I just don't find that the movie has given me much to think about.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is not a game.|Fresh
Knowing the story's outcome does nothing to lessen the potency of what's shown on screen, largely because of the courageous manner in which McQueen holds certain shots as if he's daring us to look away for even a second.|Fresh
Ejiofor's performance is the heart and soul of the movie. He is transformed from a carefree and happy family man to a downtrodden individual who has the hope for rescue continually quashed or beaten out of him.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave doesn't add much to the ongoing conversation about slavery but it's a well-made meditation about a man who endures a terrifying journey.|Fresh
Extraordinary and devastating|Fresh
Oscar nominations will likely include Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, and Supporting Actress, among others.|Fresh
The extraordinary 12 Years a Slave thrusts its lead character (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the audience into slavery's moral and psychological morass more fully and directly than any movie before it.|Fresh
Brutal yet elegant, 12 Years a Slave is a beautifully rendered punch to the gut about the most shameful chapter in American history.|Fresh
As we watch a finite horror envelop Northup, we imagine the infinite horror of people trapped in lifelong captivity.|Fresh
By forcing his audience to watch, passively, for minute after minute, McQueen makes us all complicit. It's the scene that no American has been able to produce because it's void of heroism, and shows us slavery as a mere means of doing business.|Fresh
It is not an angry movie or a judgmental one, and this just-the-facts approach brings home the heartbreaking reality of slavery in America.|Fresh
A powerful and necessary look at the abject cruelty of U.S. slavery|Fresh
Not the first (and most certainly will not be the last) film to tackle the subject of America's shameful history of slavery, but it often feels like the first real one.|Fresh
This is a nightmare of a film, but an unforgettable one.|Fresh
"""12 Years a Slave"" is essential because its raw impact is unrivaled."|Fresh
Exceedingly well-crafted and brilliantly acted by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender, McQueen's go-to star, the movie is harrowing, intense and important.|Fresh
British director Steve McQueen and American screenwriter John Ridley adapt Solomon Northup's meticulous slave narrative into a masterpiece of clear-eyed historical drama.|Fresh
It provokes recognition in us of the very heart of darkness. It makes the unimaginable imaginable.|Fresh
"""12 Years a Slave"" isn't easy to watch, and it shouldn't be; it's one man's tragedy, but it's also the tragedy of countless thousands of souls beaten down, literally and metaphorically."|Fresh
Slavery is revealed for the unrelenting horror that it was. About time.|Fresh
It's a tough movie to watch but a rewarding and thoughtful one.|Fresh
A graphically violent portrayal of the treatment of people trapped in human bondage before the Civil War, as well as a disturbing portrait of the perversity that festered in slaveholders.|Fresh
One of the best and most courageous films of the year.|Fresh
It's an ugly tale but we can't afford to take our eyes off it.|Fresh
There are moments that are less crushing than others, but there is no free-floating hope here, only that which Northup can make.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is admirable, important, and serious filmmaking that is antithetical to what most people think of as entertainment. While it might not be perfect, it demands and deserves your attention.|Fresh
The film has led you to experience slavery as an unending nightmare so horrific that there is something cruel even in Northup's liberation from it.|Fresh
Rich with details, 12 Years a Slave is an accomplished effort, yet McQueen is distracted by the weave work of story, failing to find art in agony.|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is at times difficult to watch but always impossible to turn away from.|Fresh
The film succeeds by simply, plainly placing audiences in the emotional crucible of pre-abolition America and firing their imaginations.|Fresh
The film wants to hurt you, knows you are terrified of what it will show you, then shows you way more than you bargained for.|Fresh
Provocative yet well made drama.|Fresh
This is not medicine for America to swallow; it's filmmaking of the highest caliber.|Fresh
McQueen makes the theater drapes melt away, immersing audiences in a story that will make them feel like witnesses to history.|Fresh
But make no mistake, this is Ejiofor's show, and he commands it utterly from minute one.|Fresh
The film hits like a sledgehammer, in part because it suggests that films about slavery are rare because we are guilty of burying the shameful aspects of our history.|Fresh
Though Solomon Northupp's story is one that deserves to be told, it could have benefited from a little restraint.|Fresh
Imperfect but must-see epic drama with major cruelty.|Fresh
A reminder of the awe-inspiring power great movies can have. Roll, Jordan, roll.|Fresh
"""12 Years a Slave"" finally gives America a definitive movie on its peculiar institution."|Fresh
12 Years a Slave is an outstanding triumph in filmmaking since it's so unbelievably captivating yet will leave you feeling so undeniably uncomfortable as it takes pride in ripping your mortality to shreds over the course of two hours.|Fresh
"""12 Years a Slave"" lays out an institution so twisted and wrong that its honest portrayal has been avoided for centuries. Yes, it's dark and brutal. It needs to be."|Fresh
Brilliant yet brutal without playing on our guilt. Straightforward horror with an astonishing cast. It is director Steve McQueen's masterwork|Fresh
One of the finest historical movies ever made.|Fresh
But the much talked-about 12 Years a Slave is more than a beautifully shot art piece. It's history made violently real.|Fresh
Other movies and books have gone here, but few so far and with such overwhelming clarity of purpose.|Fresh
Ejiofor brings imposing physicality and intimidating intellect to the role, and thus Northup poses a threat to his enemies -- even if they can't articulate it as such.|Fresh
An important work, but one that's more potent on an intellectual level than an emotional one.|Fresh
The film offers a formidable indictment of the cruelty of which human beings are capable.|Fresh
McQueen imbues his film with undeniable artistry and intellectual rigor, but startlingly little passion. You will be angered, horrified and moved by what you witness, but you will not be challenged.|Fresh
With this powerful, almost classical drama, British director Steve McQueen has made the seminal film about slavery that Hollywood feared to tackle.|Fresh

A gripping drama and immaculate depiction of human suffering and strength.|Fresh

Apart from caricatures-as-characters reasons, the cinematography in '12 Years a Slave' is over-prettified and distracting.|Rotten
this film falters enough that it needs to be acknowledged, its passage of time muddled...some lesser acting skills distancing, Hans Zimmer's score only occasionally rising above cliched Celtic themes and mournful fanfare.|Fresh
So raw and distressing is this historical account of a true-life American slave, it's tempting to turn away from the screen. Or maybe just cover your eyes for a few minutes of respite. Try not to.|Fresh
Stands a good chance of ending up the definitive American film about slavery.|Fresh
A parable about the fragility of the middle class.|Fresh

It's a tremendous expose into this disturbing and unconscionable institution.|Fresh
The filmmakers strangely decided to introduce the film with a brief appearance by Ejiofor to proclaim the movie's value. That, along with the pre-Oscar buzz, was perhaps too much to live up to.|Fresh

"There's a difference between an ""unflinching"" look at something and an unflinching look at a person desperately trying to project ""unflinching."" 12 Years is often upsetting for all the wrong reasons. It relegates atrocities to the level of camera tricks."|Rotten

You won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What we have here is a blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic.|Fresh
Channeling the evils of human bondage through the experiences of one weary figure, McQueen has constructed another intensely physical character study about a man trapped in his own flesh.|Fresh

This is as plain-faced a film about slavery could possibly be, and the effect of its evenness is, oddly enough, more emotion.|Fresh

[VIDEO ESSAY] If Steve McQueen would fully commit to his calling as an exploitation director, he might eventually achieve his desired effects through that more direct approach.|Rotten
