"Finding Dory is a sweet tale that will have audiences cheering our blue friend on as she ""just keeps swimming."""|Fresh
While it may not deliver the freshness of Finding Nemo, it is still overflowing with warmth, laughs, and genuine charm.|Fresh
The animation is crisp and the visuals are sharp as this world comes to life on the big screen. There's also a nice little message about family.|Fresh
What Finding Dory does get right is its Pixar pathos, eliciting tears at just the right moments, even when one is expecting it.|Fresh
Feels more than a little familiar ... the similarities between this and its predecessor will likely make many see it as an inferior Pixar film, if there is such a thing.|Fresh
Sure, Disney green lit this for financial purposes first and foremost, but the final product feels like a labour of love, a crowd pleasing joy that really does need to be seen with the biggest crowd possible.|Fresh
While it may not rank high in the Pixar canon, Finding Dory is still great fun for the whole family, has a simple but important message and it shows that's Pixar reign is far from over.|Fresh
It wisely changes up its tone to fit its main character rather than trying to shove Dory into a box she doesn't fit in.|Fresh
Finding Dory lacks the spark of something truly new that illuminates the best of Pixar, but it still works.|Fresh
Finding Dory lives up to the standers Dory has set. Cute, sweet and well put together, you'll enjoy this day at the theater.|Fresh

The film challenges a good lesson for parents and people to not be prejudice with people with disabilities but instead be patient with them.|Fresh
The sequel revisits many of the jokes of the original in an inoffensive yet ultimately unfulfilling way, making the case that Pixar should stick with originals.|Rotten
While DeGeneres's ditziness can be an acquired taste at times, it suits Dory perfectly.|Fresh
"""Finding Dory"" is thirteen years in the making and, while it brings back some familiar faces, it feels fresh and engaging, but still manages to make us feel like we're visiting with old friends."|Fresh
The simplicity of the plot makes it easy for the wee ones to follow, but adults will enjoy the multi-level fact that Nemo and his dad are not the only ones trying to find Dory -- she's trying to find herself.|Fresh
"""Finding Dory"" strikes just the right notes when it comes to creating a film with heart and a positive message."|Fresh
What sets Pixar's films apart is the studio's ability to embrace the darkness, dread and possibility of failure Dory faces. That's what brings Finding Dory close to the heights of Finding Nemo.|Fresh
Even if Dory doesn't quite measure up to its groundbreaking predecessor, it still provides plenty of entertainment as well as some wonderful opportunities to discuss with children.|Fresh
The animation is sill absolutely beautiful...There's some great jokes in this movie. And the cast just does a great job.|Fresh
Generally speaking, secondary characters are written to be secondary characters, they are not meant to be the main character...Dory makes a great main character.|Fresh
There isn't a scene that needs work or a concept that wsn't sufficiently milked for laughs or another emotion....|Fresh
Did we need Finding Dory? Probably not, and I for one would be much happier seeing Pixar work on new and exciting projects, but what is here is a touching look at the hardships of living with frustrating conditions such as short-term memory loss|Fresh
It's sweet and sentimental story is bound to leave you teary-eyed.|Fresh
It's funny, beautifully animated and cute - it just forgot to add an emotional punch.|Fresh
For those of us who've waited for over a decade to see Marlin, Nemo and Dory again, Finding Dory is a welcome piece of nostalgia. The new surprises make for a great experience, one made for the whole family.|Fresh
We never quite recapture the sheer joy of the original, but it all builds to a strong finale.|Fresh
Finding Dory will please everyone. No, it's not as sharp as Pixar is capable of being, but it is still fantastically funny, with just enough of a moral to give it a point.|Fresh
The jokes and story do not hold a candle to their predecessor, but there are enough funny and moving moments to make this a pretty solid family flick.|Fresh
[Finding Dory] injects heartfelt emotion and a thoughtful examination of the necessary links between family and identity into a film geared toward a younger audience.|Fresh
Finding Dory is delightful, perfect waterworks for the beginning of summer for children and adults.|Fresh
"""Finding Dory"" is about the self-preservation and gumption of a character with special needs throughout her life."|Fresh
The central irony of Finding Dory is that Dory is a risk-taker trapped in a movie that, for all its likability, won't join her on whimsical leaps.|Fresh
Finding Dory is also a movie with surprising emotional depth, one that's just as much about the power of active hope as it is about sight gags and cute critters.|Fresh
Finding Dory could have been a disappointing sequel to one of Pixar's most beloved films, but instead has turned out to be more than a worthy successor, giving us the full tale on one of the best characters the studio ever created.|Fresh
Finding Dory is, hands down, one of Pixar's best pieces of work to date and is nothing short of perfection.|Fresh
The film's number of memorable new characters are enough to mask its story problems|Fresh
A simple and moving story that transcends its animated aquatic world to say a lot about human feelings. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Finding Dory, perhaps in a similar vein to this year's forward-thinking Zootopia, ventures into some interesting social territories where Finding Nemo did not.|Fresh
This film seems funny enough and exciting enough to entertain kids, but there really isn't much constructive in the story itself, which is pretty close to nonsensical.|Fresh
Bright, fun and moving, this film is a solid, though not exactly ground-breaking, addition to the Pixar line-up.|Fresh
For all its attempts to expand the original's ensemble and embellish its themes, Dory is cod in batter beside Nemo's smoked salmon. But still tasty.|Fresh
The aquatic world of Dory doesn't teem with as many fascinating details as the mammalian world of spring's Zootopia, but it has its share of clever visual gags, many of them occasioned by Hank's camouflaging abilities.|Fresh
This fishy tale may not be as lively as its popular predecessor. Still, Finding Dory strikes gold anew for a new generation of family filmgoers.|Fresh
What makes Pixar great is the way it always casts shadows behind its polychrome colors, contrasting a child's conflicted urges for safety and adventure.|Fresh
In general, Finding Dory doesn't reach the heights of the original, but it delivers an hour and 40 minutes of solid entertainment.|Fresh
Stanton takes aim at the heart instead of the head. This is another touching fable about friendship, self-reliance and courage.|Fresh
This sequel is certainly more than just a shameless cash-in on one of Pixar's finest films, but it's also not quite up to the studio's highest standards.|Fresh
A reversal of 'Finding Nemo' that -- like its predecessor -- revels in the imaginative opportunities afforded by its floaty, almost surreal underwater environment, the movie has charm and warmth but lacks distinction.|Fresh
Kids around six and eight will likely love the offerings here but adults might find their patience tested by this brilliantly rendered but rather wet serving of Disney franchise extender.|Fresh
A cute follow-up to Finding Nemo.|Fresh
...look closer. Even Pixar's sages seem a bit bored with their normal M.O. ...but only Sigourney Weaver knows for sure.|Fresh
"The best sequel made by Pixar Animation Studios without the word ""toy"" in the title. This is a relief, but not all that much of an achievement."|Fresh
... a Pixar picture with all the care and love and storytelling magic that the studio brings to every project. Which makes this adventure a joyous reunion and a lovely odyssey.|Fresh
Finding Dory is a good movie, meaning that Pixar has a batting average of four for five when it comes to sequels.|Fresh
It's not bad -- certainly, the worst Pixar films are still eminently watchable -- but nor is it particularly inspired.|Fresh
Finding Dory may not quite reach the narrative success of its predecessor, but with an outstanding vocal cast, gorgeous animation, and plenty of heart, it still stands as a fine addition to Pixar's outstanding library of animated classics.|Fresh
What the film lacks in thoroughness though, it makes up for in humor, cute creatures, and marine life fun facts.|Fresh
Its originality radicates in its execution: frantic rhythm, a detailed script, brilliant design, and emotional hits strategically placed with a bunch of new characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Two raffish sea lions, a loony bird, and camouflaging, ink-blurting Gary are welcome new additions. But there's no thematic reason to return to Nemo-land-the messages are predictable. Sprightly and amusing but a bit slight and not quite memorable enough.|Fresh
The lack of originality in this film it's compensated with humor and adventure. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Because it centres on a personal quest, it's a very different style of movie, which makes some of the action feel rather contrived. But the characters are still vivid and likeable, and it's packed with meaningful themes.|Fresh
Pixar rarely fails at short films but with this film it seems that creativity is running out. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Strong, mid-tier Pixar.|Fresh
One of Pixar's most delightful offerings to date.|Fresh
'Finding Dory' is a swimming success.|Fresh
Much like its titular character, it keeps swimming, and in doing so teaches all of us life lessons that we likely already knew yet still could use to revisit all the same.|Fresh
Balance is the thing and Stanton and MacLane know when to use a well-timed piece of slapstick or visual gag to cut through sentiment.|Fresh
What it lacks in ingenuity, Finding Dory more than makes up for with enjoyability for all ages, making this a worthwhile plunge back into the ocean.|Fresh
Finding Dory's unflinchingly complex and emotional look at disability and creative thinking still proves memorable.|Fresh
I'm not sure this film has the emotional resonance of the original, and nothing much is done to develop the characters of Marlin and Nemo. But Finding Dory is a lot of fun, and went down a bomb with junior critics.|Fresh
Before a somewhat cluttered conclusion, Finding Dory is a truly touching film, graceful in its exploration of identity, family, and the way they intersect.|Fresh
We're now at a point in the history of animation where animators can tell a joke with a facial expression shared between a fish and a cephalopod.|Fresh
Stuffed to the gills with gags and generates plenty of empathy for the Ellen DeGeneres-voiced Dory ...|Fresh
Finding Dory is inferior to Finding Nemo (and both Toy Story sequels). Those films are tesseracts, this one's a cube. That said, to label it average somehow misses the point.|Fresh
The short-term memory-loss business very quickly becomes more wearing than funny. I can't say that its poignancy really worked on me, either, though I know it has on some.|Rotten
While entertaining and beautifully animated, with some amusing set-pieces that will thrill children, it's a rather shallow follow up that doesn't touch the heart.|Fresh
Dory's story will not leave a dry eye in the cinema.|Fresh
It is approached with such charm and warmth that it hardly matters that the two films share such similar arcs.|Fresh
There are commendable lessons here about being resilient and resourceful and kind, but you'll have fun learning them.|Fresh
...though he only appears for a minute or two, Gerald immediately enters the pantheon of great Pixar side characters...|Fresh
There are large dollops of sentimentality and we all know just how the story is going to end, but there's an enjoyably anarchic undertow to proceedings, not least when the fish commandeer a lorry and race the wrong way up a freeway.|Fresh
Finding Dory is an enchanting tale that never once fells like an unnecessary retread, and while not quite surpassing its predecessor, it at least equals it. And when the pedigree you're talking about is this high, that's quite an achievement.|Fresh
It's ironic that a film about a forgetful fish should be so forgettable.|Rotten
Get in the swim.|Fresh
It's Pixar's most complete film. Laughs, schmaltz, wit, excitement, tears. Truly wonderful.|Fresh
All in all, Finding Dory is exactly what a great sequel should be - like the original, only better.|Fresh
When there are lulls in the action, these are filled too often by homilies and life lessons that demand no spelling out.|Rotten
It's watchable, with all the wonderful animation technique that we are in danger of taking for granted. But it's basically a footnote or retread of the movie which melted everyone's heart 12 years ago.|Fresh
There are few dud jokes, if any, in a script directed with vaudevillian verve by Andrew Stanton, the human pilot fish behind Nemo and Wall-E who also wrote Toy Stories one to three and Monsters, Inc.|Fresh
A film with excellent visual quality that even if it's aimed at children, it doesn't shy away from emotionally difficult themes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Time to clear some shelf space beside The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back and Aliens -- this will be watched just as often.|Fresh
Another Pixar mega success, it's almost as good as Finding Nemo and fab for viewers of all ages.|Fresh
Finding Dory may be familiar magic, but there's magic in it all the same.|Fresh
It's not better than the original, but it's also a great movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A solid animated film, with impressive visuals, emotion and lots of excitement. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Finding Dory knows what it means to be an entertaining film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The sluggish pace and wayward plot are reminiscent of one of Disney's many, many home-entertainment sequels.|Rotten
As always, mid-tier Pixar is better than 90 percent of stuff out there.|Fresh
Another sample of why Pixar is he king of animation films. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It might not be a perfect sequel, but at least is proof that Hollywood still has more ideas that go beyond mere publicity and quick cash grabs. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A movie full of heartwarming moments, of personal growth, and humor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It may not be the freshest story in the Pixar catalogue to date but with its undeniable feel-good nature and authentic nods of nostalgia, you'll certainly find yourself smiling from ear-to-ear that these lovable little fish have swum back into your lives.|Fresh
It's filled to the gills with engaging anthropomorphised animals and a succession of frankly dazzling action sequences in which the main characters make their way through an unseeing human world.|Fresh
The brilliant animation functions with symbolic profundity, for the film is all about Dory exploring her own deep blues, an elusive sadness she can't identify, tugging from a place within.|Fresh
It has a breathless, often frantic storyline that doesn't add up to much. But the beautifully rendered undersea locations and a rip-roaring nail-biter of an ending make up for the slack.|Fresh
It's a more than adequate sequel to a much loved animated classic.|Fresh
While it may not be as engrossing as its predecessor, Pixar's follow-up to its 2003's animated smash-hit Finding Nemo still manages to find its own groove.|Fresh
Being a Pixar film it is, of course, eye-poppingly rich with color and detail. (The glowy underwater light of the film is particularly breathtaking).|Fresh
In many ways, Finding Dory improves upon its predecessor, although it still doesn't rank as any kind of major achievement for the beloved animation studio.|Fresh
Finding Dory is really just Finding Nemo Redux but within its casual recycling we get at least one genius new joke.|Fresh
['septopus' Hank's] flexibility and timidity, coupled with Dory's vulnerability and derring-do, make for a complex dialectic on the different ways in which the disabled can interact with the world beyond|Fresh
Entertaining enough not to embarrass the original. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
Despite the familiar narrative scaffolding ... the most memorable joys of the journey are the things that artists undoubtedly discovered in the course of spontaneous play.|Fresh
... director and writer Andrew Stanton is able to make an original and heartwarming story about Dory's past and how she came to be.|Fresh
A nice and enjoyable film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A master class on cinema, animation, and style. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Look what the tide brought in: The fish version of Memento.|Fresh
A quirky menagerie of all the fundamental ingredients of a passable Pixar vehicle: adventure, complex plot situations, perceptive dialogue, tongue-in-cheek awareness, joy, charisma, likable characters and visuals that inspire wonder.|Fresh
A great sequel to a modern animated classic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Finding Dory doesn't lose track of the character's particular predicament.|Fresh
Does it reach the emotional heights of its original? No. Is it funnier? Surprisingly, yes.|Fresh
Finding Dory doesn't quite reach the heights of Finding Nemo. But it's a lovely experience for those riding the Pacific Ocean currents for the first time, and a nostalgic one for those of us returning.|Fresh
"Dory, the unforgettable character from ""Finding Nemo,"" is given her own showcase here and the Pixar team truly does a tremendous job bringing her poignant and personal story to life."|Fresh
Pixar has created a sequel just as good as the one that came out thirteen years ago. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The animation team's work is perfect. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An entertaining and touching sequel. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"If Dory lacks the imagination and surprise of its Nemosis, it still makes for a pleasant family outing, especially when paired with the gentle Pixar short, ""Piper""."|Fresh
Finding Dory succeeds in transporting us to a wonderful underwater world while enhancing the franchise's emotional core.|Fresh
The detailed reproduction of underwater life is there before the eyes, but it constantly competes with the assault on the ears from talkative and neurotic sea creatures that have clearly spent too much time in human company.|Rotten
For anyone who is not a legally bound babysitter, Finding Dory offers nothing that will please a taste for finer humor, freer fun, or genuinely expressive filmmaking.|Rotten
An improvement over the original, with a perfect payoff as well as a lesson that isn't as belabored as in the first film. (Splice Today)|Fresh
For kids and adults, there's a lovely parable about persistence, optimism and embracing difference. Something we could all use a little more of.|Fresh
Finding Dory makes a splash, is as good if not better than Finding Nemo.|Fresh
Intermittently cute and nothing more.|Rotten
A funny, exciting, and incredibly heartbreaking tale of overcoming a handicap and leaning on family when the world is at its darkest.|Fresh
An inventive animated film about short-term memory loss, the longing to return home, and the lessons learned on a quest.|Fresh
Finding Dory might not hit the emotional highs of Nemo, but it's right on track with everything else. An immensely satisfying family film.|Fresh
If I wasn't choking back tears, Finding Dory had me laughing until I hurt myself. Oh yes, and it looks amazing, too.|Fresh
shares much with last year's blockbuster MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, including the sense that nothing is impossible, including testing the laws of physics to their limits, and a strong message of feminine empowerment|Fresh
Dory can fritter away your interest, and the prominence also exposes the limitations of DeGeneres as a voice actor: daffy blather is a cinch for the talk-show host, but she absolutely milks any attempt at pathos.|Rotten
Like all Pixar movies (except Cars 2), this has some golden moments that hit you right in the feels.|Fresh
...a solid effort and a nice comeback from last year's The Good Dinosaur, but this is not the best American animated feature we've seen this year.|Fresh
"For a fish story, ""Finding Dory"" is pretty small scale. Or at least it seems when tossed into the sea with a whopper like ""Finding Nemo."" It simply can't measure up emotionally or narratively."|Fresh
Finding Dory is as entertaining, soul enriching and bittersweet as any Pixar production to date.|Fresh
Efforts like Finding Dory, while perfectly pleasant, do little to quell the feeling that a certain measure of rubber-stamp efficiency has gripped the studio (the superb Inside Out excepted). In other words, welcome to Pixar's cash-grab years.|Fresh
Gently entertaining... gets funny...Tidbits provide something for adults when they take the kids but that is not enough of a reason for adults to come on their own.|Fresh
This follow-up provides a solid mix of action and comedy without allowing its melancholy themes to channel cheap sentiment.|Fresh
Dory's adventures are amiable enough, but the film lacks energy and suffers from a sense of predictability.|Fresh
It took them thirteen years to find the right way to tell her story, but all that time and effort has produced quite a gem.|Fresh
The franchise from the outset has confronted notions of disability and challenged parental responses to it, and Finding Dory is no different.|Fresh
certainly lives up to the original|Fresh
'Finding Dory' in the wake its predecessor, the now-legendary 'Nemo,' was no small task... delightfully pleasing on every level...|Fresh
Finding Dory could be funnier. It relies on some callbacks to Finding Nemo and a lot of over-the-top action. But you'd have to have a briny heart to deny there's something special about it.|Fresh
Perhaps it's because I'm a soulless husk of a man and dead inside, but the Pixar formula just isn't cutting it for me anymore.|Rotten
Though it lacks the same emotional heft of the original, it's darned near good enough to change one's unfavorable opinion of sequels|Fresh
From start to fin-ish, 'Finding Dory' is unforgettable.|Fresh
What the film lacks in clean-cut storytelling, though, it more than makes up for in sheer emotionality. Finding Dory is the rare sequel that repurposes the original as a foundation rather than as a cheap form of fan service.|Fresh
A visually marvelous 3-D sequel (but not equal) to the original.|Fresh
Finding Dory isn't just a worthy sequel to Nemo, it also succeeds on its own - as a rousing tale of love and overcoming adversity.|Fresh
It's all lovely and sweet, gentle and humane, but it doesn't rise to the creative or emotional heights of its predecessor.|Fresh
Loaded with excitement and adrenalin- packed moments, Finding Dory is, as expected, full of humour, largely due to Dory's memory issues and delightfully funny nature.|Fresh
It's a quality piece of family animation with a fun finish that hits a few themes you might expect and a few that will surprise you.|Fresh
It's a sequel that's a continuation of the original film rather than an expansion of it, and it is still a success, though not a triumph.|Fresh
Despite its minor flaws, Finding Dory is still successful at serving a good platter of both humour and nostalgia.|Fresh
Finding Dory is charming, very funny, touching and more than a bit repetitive but never a bore.|Fresh
The gorgeous, thoughtful, funny Finding Dory is made by the Pixar family for everyone to share with someone they care about, no matter the age, gender, ethnicity -- or even species, for that matter.|Fresh
Stanton is a born comic-fantasy director.|Fresh
Just when it appears Finding Dory is the latest in a long line of sequel casualties, the deliriously fun and witty third act arrives to mount a revival, as everything comes together and the setups finally deliver laugh-out-loud payoffs.|Fresh
Kudos to Ellen. It's an Oscar-worthy performance. Finding Dory is so well-done and beautifully filmed that you forget the main characters aren't real fish and other sea life.|Fresh
Delightful sequel promotes teamwork; some sadness/scares.|Fresh
There may be tears. But remember what Dory says: Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.|Fresh
DeGeneres has the funny bits down pat...But it's in Dory's quieter moments that (she) breathes a soul into her little blue character: Speaking barely above a whisper, she registers wonder, trepidation and, occasionally, heartbreaking sorrow.|Fresh
While it's too similar to the Oscar-winning original to swim completely solo, Finding Dory is a delightful sequel that gives further life to some of Pixar's most loveable characters.|Fresh
"The closing credits feature Sia singing Nat King Cole's ""Unforgettable"" - it's a good gag, but I wouldn't go quite that far in describing ""Finding Dory."" Still, it's a delightful film that families will want to remember from time to time."|Fresh
A deep sea treasure with endless charms that swim around in your mind.|Fresh
Be sure, you will laugh, your kids will laugh but be also sure, you will not cry. And that makes the whole difference with Pixar.|Fresh
You want to go to Finding Dory to see the little baby Dory|Fresh
It's a very cute film that little ones especially will adore.|Fresh
Hank the octopus is a particular standout … his mad skills are highly entertaining — so entertaining, in fact, that I kind of wish the movie had been about him.|Fresh
A sequel that betters the boffo 2003 animated feature Finding Nemo and provides more evidence, after last year's highly original Inside Out, that Pixar has finally emerged from the uninspiring years of the Cars franchise.|Fresh
The film is often visually striking and charming enough, but it's low on two things we've come to expect from Pixar: comedy and moving emotional moments.|Fresh
Funny, genuinely poignant, and thrilling with dazzling CGI. It will win your heart over. Expect it to be nominated for Best Animated Feature.|Fresh
Finding Dory has its moments, but it's not one of Pixar's home runs.|Rotten
'Finding Dory' has plenty of laughs and lots of spectacle, but when it drives home the underlying themes of family and determination, it earns every bit of it.|Fresh
Nuanced and tender-hearted.|Fresh
"""Finding Dory's"" animators outdo themselves here, delivering one arresting image after another, the highlight being a sequence showing hundreds of manta rays migrating that's not only gorgeous but thrilling as well."|Fresh
[Finding Dory] is flat-out terrific, even a little subversive.|Fresh
Exhilarating adventure, irresistible wit, breathtaking visuals and an all-star voice cast (just about everybody wanted part of this one) combine in a seamless banquet of pure entertainment.|Fresh
It's a solid, entertaining, well-paced sequel featuring terrific voice work, a clever script and some ingenious action sequences.|Fresh
It is a perfectly entertaining film; kids will certainly enjoy it. But that's all it is.|Fresh
Much of the movie is genuinely entertaining, but some of it betrays the same desperation that you find in bad animated flicks, as the filmmakers keep things loud, fast, and colorful in the hope that the smallest audience members won't get bored.|Fresh
Any fan of Pixar already knows what they are going to get at Finding Dory: a mix of charm, wit and intelligence, combined with animation so routinely spectacular that a reviewer might not even think to mention it until the end of his review.|Fresh
We're talking then about a family film for the whole family -- little ones, seniors and all generations between.|Fresh
Finding Dory may be more of a minnow than a whale of a tale for Pixar, but it's still a good catch.|Fresh
"The ""fish out of water"" theme plays out to Buster Keaton-style excess in the hilarious and adorable Finding Dory."|Fresh
"While it might not quite match up to the overall beginning to end brilliance of ""Nemo,"" ""Dory"" is a well-made, entertaining and certainly enjoyable film for viewers of all ages. (Full Content Review for Parents - Scares, etc. - Also Available)"|Fresh
Structurally, it's pretty similar to Finding Nemo, and plenty of familiar characters turn up. But the animation strides made in the 13 years between movies are remarkable. Finding Dory looks spectacular.|Fresh
"As the 13-year gap between ""Nemo"" and ""Dory"" indicates, this was not a concept that cried out to be made."|Rotten
It is nice, especially at this precise moment, to believe that evil and cruelty don't necessarily have to exist in the world: that even in the great big ocean, a couple of small fish looking for help can always depend on the kindness of strangers.|Fresh
Full on action farce that had me trademark Fast and the Fishiest as a new title for the flick, [yet] with PIXAR's latest outing it seems that they're treading water|Fresh
Did Finding Nemo really need a sequel? Probably not. But Finding Dory deftly manages to breathe new life into Pixar's most popular fish, while also introducing a school of lively new newcomers as well.|Fresh
"""Finding Dory"" can be touching, sweet and tender, but it's compulsively, preposterously and steadfastly funny."|Fresh
"There are terrific Pixar sequels (""Toy Story 2"" and ""3"") and OK Pixar sequels (""Cars 2,"" ""Monsters University""). ""Finding Dory"" is one of the terrific ones, if not quite up to the ""Toy Story"" standard."|Fresh
"If there has ever been a better voice performance in an animated film than Ellen DeGeneres' in Pixar's wonderful sequel ""Finding Dory,"" I sure can't think of it."|Fresh
Pixar films are invariably clever and play on multiple levels, and this one is no exception. There's something deeply moving about Dory's plight.|Fresh
It's almost impossible that you as a father or a kid and loved Nemo, don't get moved by Dory. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The wait was worth it, the film maintains the emotion, sensibility, beauty and narrative that made the first one great. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Finding Dory will be a popular summer movie but just don't expect one of their better performances.|Fresh
The elemental emotions at work and the childlike awe at the undersea world -- rendered once again in colorful, carefully researched, lovingly precise animation -- contribute to the sense of a story timeless and pure.|Fresh
A world-wide aquatic playground filled with rambunctious slapstick, Dickensian sea creatures, astonishing visual beauty and relentless albeit implausible jeopardy.|Fresh
The marvel of Dory, and of so many Pixar movies, is that the primal payload is securely delivered even as the plot gets crowded with vivid, scene-stealing characters and takes wildly inventive twists.|Fresh
'Dory' ... works on multiple levels: It's a fun-filled animated feature that will please and entertain children and ... parents, while it also examines how parents protect, encourage and love offspring with special needs. ...|Fresh
Finding Dory [is] a powerful story of loss and, eventually, improbable triumph.|Fresh
"We cry not because the movie has tapped into our deepest hopes and fears, but because this is the part where we're supposed to. Dory's catchphrase is ""Just keep swimming,"" but the movie feels like it's just paddling in circles."|Fresh
Much of Finding Dory is funny, and fun. But there's something kind of haunting about our heroine's memory thing.|Fresh
Finding Dory is delightful throughout, dazzling during its many highlight scenes and just a tad disorienting on rare occasions.|Fresh
Kids should enjoy the frantic pace of the movie, but adult fans of Nemo (AFONs?) may grumble about diminishing returns.|Fresh
Finding Dory isn't a vital addition to the Pixar canon... But it's nice to see Stanton back in his element, especially when he's here to deliver such a helpful, important message in the process.|Fresh
Easily the best Pixar sequel since Toy Story 3. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In deciding not to stray far from the first film in plot or tone, it makes for a pleasant, familiar, cheerfully unassuming fish-in-her-water tale.|Fresh
"The title character may be a forgetful fish, but ""Finding Dory"" is a movie to remember."|Fresh
"Audiences should find ""Dory"" one of Pixar's most charming achievements."|Fresh
[It} lacks the wit, imagination and sheer sense of amazement that made the 2003 original an eventual animation classic. Nonetheless, Dory offers adventure and fun as it swims in gorgeous, animated, photorealistic detail.|Fresh
Where Finding Nemo capitalized on the awesome splendor and danger of the ocean, this follow-up shifts much of its action to an aquatic park and becomes broader and sillier, or at least reality-busting, for it. And, hey, that's OK.|Fresh
Directors Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane make it very clear what you are supposed to feel and when you are supposed to feel it. What they don't do is earn it.|Rotten
Fans of the original fishy tale will be delighted to learn that the sequel has most definitely been worth the wait.|Fresh
A perfectly serviceable continuation that doesn't truly widen the oceanic realm, but it does make time for old friends and familiar conflicts, playing it safe to make sure the faithful walk away satisfied.|Fresh
For the most part, the film plays it maddeningly safe, and then the third act arrives, at which point all hell breaks loose in the most glorious, adorable way possible.|Fresh
"""Finding Dory"" will have a strong place in the summer animation line-up, but may get lost in the Oscar shuffle."|Fresh
"With genius executive producer John Lasseter's stamp of approval on ""Finding Dory"", what's not to like?"|Fresh
It's ironic that a movie about a character with short-term memory loss turns out to be one of Pixar's more forgettable efforts...[still it] will afford modest pleasure to children and adults alike.|Fresh
Emotionally engaging, it's splashy family fun...|Fresh
Hank [the octopus] is one of the best characters Pixar's ever brought to life, aided by O'Neill's grumpy-with-a-heart vocalization. 'Holy carp!' indeed.|Fresh
Pixar sequel-phobes be damned - this is a dazzling and technically impressive return to form that delivers a similar high to Finding Nemo without feeling like a retread.|Fresh
The movie has plenty of heart and a message which, if not always subtle, remains worth hearing: All of us have strengths and weaknesses, while qualities that disable us in one way might enable us in another.|Fresh
Resisting the temptation to rehash Finding Nemo with new characters as too many sequels do, this fine-finned tale tells a complementary story from the opposite direction.|Fresh
"""Finding Dory"" ranks with ""Toy Story 3"" as the animation studio's strongest sequel. The underwater tale manages to be both immersive and buoyant."|Fresh
Although DeGeneres' Dory, with her breathless stream-of-consciousness patter, is unavoidably likable, the cast of supporting characters here may be even better.|Fresh
If the first movie was about parents learning to face their fears and trust their children, this one is about facing the fears that come with parenting a special-needs child.|Fresh
"For all the witty voices and great escapes (maybe one too many of the latter), ""Finding Dory"" is ultimately a character story, and DeGeneres' lovable, brave Dory swims right into our hearts."|Fresh
While Dory is thoroughly charming and enjoyable, it's also a bit formulaic and repetitive, especially during the drawn-out third act.|Fresh
A worthy successor, Finding Dory sets its own course, and joyfully delivers.|Fresh
Finding Dory has some great new characters -- Ed O'Neill's cantankerous Octopus, Ty Burrell's beluga whale and Kaitlin Olson's whale shark stand out. The animation is exquisite. A good portion of the film, however, feels reheated.|Fresh
There's a sense of familiarity with Finding Dory. It's not breaking new ground. But it also doesn't have to. Pixar has perfected the formula, and if it's not broken, there's no point in trying to fix it. It just works.|Fresh
Finding Dory, bright and clever like most all Pixar releases, has the animation studio's familiar blend of wit, heart and visual detail. But it's missing its own magic.|Fresh
It's a lovely trip, with the swirling sea and rainbow-hued sea creatures as gorgeously animated as you would expect from Pixar.|Fresh
Finding Dory often goes, if you'll forgive the maritime metaphor, to a level a few fathoms below the cruising depth of its much-loved predecessor.|Fresh
The soothing beauty pulls you in, inviting you to immerse yourself for a couple of hours in the best of all possible worlds.|Fresh
Genuinely daring -- and one of the best things Pixar's ever produced.|Fresh
There's tears to fill a tide pool, wit to keep adults amused and laughs for any audience with a short attention span.|Fresh
Finding Dory follows its predecessor in being broadly concerned with comforting notions of home and family.|Fresh
The inclusiveness of the film's vision is remarkable partly because it feels so natural, something that no adult will really need to explain. Children will get it, perhaps more intuitively and easily than the rest of us.|Fresh
In Finding Dory, [director Andrew] Stanton and his crew strike a perfect balance between art and entertainment.|Fresh
Finding Dory can't be faulted for much except it isn't Finding Nemo. No shame in that, just sadness. Thirteen years ago a movie broke ground now stomped flat by an animation stampede... Greatness deserves better. How soon we forget.|Fresh
Finding Dory isn't so much a sequel to Finding Nemo as it is a Looney Tunes spin-off: Wilder, sillier, broader and instantly disposable.|Rotten
Finding Dory is an incredibly imaginative sequel with just the right amount of humor and heart.|Fresh
Finding Dory manages to find something new and profound amid recycling the formula and gimmicks of its predecessor.|Fresh
"Like the original, ""Finding Dory"" makes us understand the fears, joys, struggles and triumphs of family. See it with yours."|Fresh
Finding Dory is the first major film we can remember getting a release during Ramadan. Time will tell whether this gamble works -- but this is exactly the kind of movie that families would want to make a point of going to see.|Fresh
Finding Dory is a solid piece of all-ages entertainment, but in depth of emotion, it does not reach the standard set by predecessor Finding Nemo.|Fresh
Sometimes it takes a plucky animated fish to illustrate the benefits of thinking on your fins (er, feet). Now that's a lesson worth retaining.|Fresh
Finding Dory has some excellent animation, impressive 3D effects, and fun new characters.|Fresh
...smart, funny, and visually astounding...|Fresh
Another huge improvement from its predecessor is the animation, from the way the kelp sways in the ocean to Hank's camouflaging metamorphosis. The filmmakers provide a dynamic, colorful backdrop worthy of 3-D viewing.|Fresh
Morbidity covers every scale of Finding Dory like fin rot.|Rotten
Though a clear notch beneath its classic predecessor Finding Nemo, lively pacing and a genuinely inspired finale is sure to leave viewers of all ages perfectly happy with what they have seen.|Fresh
Finding Dory is like meeting up with an old friend and realizing that somehow, in spite of all the years and distance, no time has passed at all.|Fresh
...at least exceeds expectations, if not the original.|Fresh
Another fine film from Pixar, not a classic but fans of Finding Nemo will be very happy Dory just kept swimming.|Fresh
If Finding Dory lacks the fresh surprise of its predecessor, it still brims with humor, heart and animation miracles.|Fresh
There's a new Pixar film in theaters, and it's a catch.|Fresh
Sweet, but not as funny or as original as the original|Fresh
Navigates tricky emotional territory with a perceptiveness and tact that isn't just great storytelling, but could be a real comfort to parents and children alike who unexpectedly see themselves in Dory's plight.|Fresh
The visual personality of the movie is fantastically vivid and bright, the story itself, less so.|Fresh
It rises above its crowded narrative with an intense emotional core, taking a protagonist whose affliction had been played mostly for comedy, and exploring the emptiness and loneliness of her plight.|Fresh
"Finding Dory, like most ""lesser Pixar,"" is more fun around the edges than the competition tends to be at center."|Fresh
"""Finding Dory"" upholds the Pixar tradition with plenty of inventive humor, cleverly drawn characters and emotionally resonant moments."|Fresh
"Of course, ""Dory"" has plot similarities to ""Nemo,"" but there is enough love and care devoted to everything from the characters on down that it works beautifully, even without element of surprise."|Fresh
Finding Dory is the kind of enthralling, immersive movie that will have your inner Inside Out crew working overtime handling all the emotions.|Fresh
Pixar's latest is yet another sequel that's head and fin above most animated fare, but not accomplishing much more than the original already managed. (See also: Monsters University. Don't see, ever: Cars 2.)|Fresh
Finding Dory does something special - and courageous - with the message it tells, offering children something much more than entertainment.|Fresh
Finding Dory will likely mean the world to those living with special needs, or those who love them. Pixar has given them a hero who is special and needed.|Fresh
It's bright and colourful with a throng of ultra cute marine characters but the film is a pale imitation of its precursor Finding Nemo, never replicating its magic or touching our heartstrings.|Rotten
In terms of emotional complexity and character evolution, Finding Dory treads the same water as its predecessor with less success.|Fresh
If the plotting at first feels overly familiar (and, in many ways, is), its elegance becomes apparent in the reinvigorating final movements, which also confirm Finding Dory's ultimate theme of building self-confidence through self-discovery.|Fresh
Finding Dory is one of the most devastating things Pixar has made - all while often being even bouncier than Finding Nemo.|Fresh
DeGeneres's vocal performance is extraordinary, effortlessly shifting from jokes to self-perpetuated anxiety attacks.|Fresh
A compassionate portrait of mental illness for families with young ones... It's also got a Die Hard 2 thing going on.|Fresh
Dory is still irrepressible in Finding Dory, still making her way brightly and cluelessly through life in a state of perpetual now, but her backstory adds a steady element of pathos to a movie that otherwise follows in the same beats as the original.|Fresh
Never as shattering as Pixar's best and most brutal. In fact, it's almost subtle. But it's the kind of film that dares you to undermine it, just so it can whack you upside the head and steal one more tear.|Fresh
"The result might be less fulfilling this time, but ""Dory"" is ultimately worth the voyage."|Fresh
"One of the great joys of ""Finding Dory"" is that every character you loved will be just as dear to your heart as before."|Fresh
A fantasy trip that will make you leave the theatre smiling. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There will be enough tears to fill a small inflatable pool, if not an ocean.|Fresh
Although never challenging the original's high standing within the Pixar pantheon, this sequel showcases everything the venerated animation company does so well, providing plentiful laughs, ace action sequences and a deep emotional wellspring.|Fresh
On a scale of Cars 2 to Toy Story 3, Finding Dory is about on par with Monsters University - delivering more of characters that audiences love, while not quite reaching the level of its predecessor.|Fresh
"Unequivocal joy in cinematic form. There is a reason the delightful ""Finding Nemo"" has become a beloved modern animated classic, and ""Finding Dory"" is headed for the same heralded status."|Fresh
It's neither as good as you hoped nor as bad as you feared.|Fresh
Pixar's wizardry is baked into every detail, from the sun-dappled ocean surfaces to the underwater visuals that border on photorealism. It's unforgettable stuff.|Fresh
While the animation is still top-notch and a slew of new waterlogged personalities buoy the story, it doesn't have nearly the same sense of heart, wonder and awe as Nemo.|Fresh
One of the biggest and most pleasant surprises in a film with too few of them is just how resonant Dory will be for parents of kids with learning disabilities.|Fresh
Stanton and co-director Angus MacLane augment the hilarious characters with visual grandeur (who knew there were this many shades of blue?) and comedy, particularly from Hank the octopus' chameleonic and contortionist skills.|Fresh
After 21 years, the Pixar formula is still very satisfying. But it also feels more like a formula than ever before.|Fresh
Its heroine may suffer from short-term memory loss, but viewers with any memory at all will realize that Finding Dory falls rather short of its wondrous progenitor.|Rotten
"Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane, the co-directors of ""Finding Dory,"" have made a beautiful, rambunctious, and fully felt sequel - a movie totally worth its salt water."|Fresh
Finding Dory is just about as good as Finding Nemo and will probably make you cry.|Fresh
Pixar's best film since Up, and a compelling argument as to why we make sequels in the first place.|Fresh
