Santiago Leilo does an extraordinary job with this rounded script, filled with uncomfortable situations that will leave you with goosebumps. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Daniela Vega is haunting in the title role.|Fresh
The movie is great. And, if it helps people put themselves in the pumps of the Marinas out there, how could that be anything but fantastic?|Fresh
[Sebastián] Lelios was lucky that he had an actress as capable as [Daniela] Vega to depend on.|Fresh
The film's thinness as a story is largely compensated for by Daniela Vega imposing a personality on the character and material that aren't quite there without her.|Fresh
[Daniela] Vega is a force of nature - steely eyed, stylishly dressed - and Lelio's film is a compelling showcase for her enigmatic magnetism.|Fresh
Lelio achieves a film with laudable intentions, visually captivating and fully conscious of his moral standing. {Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

Empathetic and ethically compelling, it's tender and well-timed.|Fresh
I get that the protagonist is mourning, but geez Louise, does the entire film have to die along with her?|Rotten
A film that honors gender identity while challenging our notion of what it means to be transgender.|Fresh
The picture works as an extended scream against lazy assumptions and blinkered bigotry. But it is also light, funny, wry and inspiring.|Fresh
All of us deal with this very existential crisis, but in Marina's case, it is obviously compounded by social mores, which varying degrees of privilege allow most of us to ignore.|Fresh
Leilo's film is warm and contemplative rather than cold and clinical, with light doses of magical realism and a marvelous lead performance from Vega.|Fresh
...fascinating fiction. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
So the role was not exactly written for [Daniela] Vega, but thank heavens for serendipity-her performance is outstanding.|Fresh
It's a movie of the moment, pleading for hope and change against formidable, unfortunate odds.|Fresh
Mixed in with these dark strains, we have glints of comedy and bursts of magic realism...In this empathetic portrait of suffering and resilience, Lelio has also crafted a very 21st-century version of the woman's picture.|Fresh
"Hopefully there will be many more films to come featuring trans performers in leading roles, and ""Woman"" can be looked back on as a well-meaning but flawed effort that paved the way."|Rotten
"At every turn, ""A Fantastic Woman"" chooses a bolder path of realization over revelation and intimacy over inclusion - one on which Marina learns that her journey is, at least for right now, one in which any comforts found must be solitary."|Fresh
Almost every interaction is tinged by (understandable) wariness, but since she confides in no one, including the audience, we never get past that fantastic skin.|Rotten

A Fantastic Woman is magnificent in every way.|Fresh
A humorless sense of melodrama helps keep it from becoming unassailably fantastic as a whole, but there's no denying that it is fantastically timely, and touching to boot.|Fresh
'A Fantastic Woman' is a movie for our time, covering issues about inclusion and identity that seem to be heightened in today's polarized world.|Fresh
Some of those advocacy aspects may play a bit broadly with contemporary American arthouse audiences more familiar with trans-rights issues, but this is a Chilean film first.|Fresh
An intriguing look at the grieving process, identity politics and the fierce determination of a member of an underrepresented faction in society.|Fresh
A Fantastic Woman rests on the shoulders of Daniela Vega's performance as Marina. Vega smoulders, seethes, and occasionally implodes. It's a piece of work of astonishing, internalised power.|Fresh
An accomplished and deeply moving film, gloriously rendered with shifting harmonies, gusto, poise and heartfelt emotion.|Fresh
"It's impossible to watch [this| and not consider it one of the best films of 2017."|Fresh
A conventional woman's film that has its greatest audacity in the charisma of its trans protagonist, Daniela Vega. (Complete review in Spanish in Refroma.com)|Fresh
Emotional, poetic, intensely moving, A Fantastic Woman is beautifully directed and photographed, has Hitchcockian undertones and finds memorable ways of visually evoking Marina's isolation and bravery.|Fresh
This is a fiercely internalised performance -- the anti-Almodovar -- with Vega's expression hovering between quiet dignity, sublimated anger and a look of steely defiance that is, in turn, further provocation to the outside world.|Fresh
A Fantastic Woman asks us to embrace all things fluid and, thanks to the superstar at its centre, it's a pleasure to go with the flow.|Fresh
The director's empathy for the indignities of female solitude remains very much his strong suit.|Fresh
A magnetic screen presence, Vega is called upon to unify the film's shifting moods - no mean feat. It's a challenge to which she rises with ease ...|Fresh
This is one aptly named drama, and international superstar-in-the-making Daniela Vega easily becomes the reason why.|Fresh
There are so many forces beneath the surface, and the beauty of the dramatic design is the way it uses Marina as the constant swimmer, letting us see what those forces are in the way she reacts to each one.|Fresh
The performance of Daniela Vega is amazing ... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Marina battles on, a force of nature, despite the elements gathered in opposition, and this big-hearted, sweepingly realised melodrama plays like an intoxicating tribute to that fighting spirit.|Fresh

A moving story about the spiritual journey of a grieving transgender woman.|Fresh
A compassionate, compelling tale for anyone who loves a good Pedro Almodóvar melodrama.|Fresh
An exquisite melodrama about the extremes of love and grief and familial conflict that also, when you're least expecting it, packs a hefty political wallop.|Fresh
This fantastic Chilean woman very much lives up to the film's title.|Fresh
When the screen went dark prior to running the final credits, I assumed for an instant that some small initial section had come to a close. In fact, an hour and three quarters had gone by.|Fresh
Without preaching from the pulpit, A Fantastic Woman powerfully communicates the hostility and hatred that persons such as Marina encounter simply due to their otherness.|Fresh
As Marina, Daniela Vega's nearly unshakable composure renders the story one of specific emotional injustice.|Fresh
May not deserve the adjective of the title, but Vega certainly does; her performance makes an imperfect film worth seeing.|Fresh
Regardless of the story's sexual politics, Marina is the type of movie heroine that any audience will root for (one reason why it has secured an Oscar nomination).|Fresh
Minimalist in its focus on Marina, this engrossing, character-driven film reveals a tender and strong love that sustains Marina, literally anchoring every scene, often in the center of the frame.|Fresh
About someone searching for himself - and, in this case, herself - in a landscape dense with the visual language of that quest.|Fresh
"Marina, however, lives up the title. She truly is a ""fantastic woman"" - facing her abusers with toughness, sass and even compassion as she quietly fights - alone - for simple dignity"|Fresh
Vega's performance is transfixing.|Fresh
There is lots of frenetic movement, in cars or buses, and a hedonistic nightclub scene which turns into a captivatingly stylish dance routine.|Fresh
Daniela Vega is a delight.|Fresh
The plot is straightforward, but the film's tone and style supply an artful mix of sensations. The lighting is colorful and heady...The film's rhythms gracefully accompany her endeavor, rising and falling with every setback or tiny, incremental victory.|Fresh
Defiant, determined, Vega delivers a star-making performance in a drama of embattled grief, directed with heart.|Fresh
Given it could be re-titled 'Microaggressions: The Movie', this is an unsurprisingly upsetting watch at times, but it's made compelling by Vega's dignified, heartfelt performance.|Fresh
Compelling on a human level but dramatically monotonous. There aren't exactly a lot of surprises here.|Rotten
Vega establishes a milestone in the push for equality playing a transgender woman determined to properly grieve for her recently deceased lover.|Fresh

A powerful, heartbreaking, empowering experience.|Fresh
"Lelio occasionally steps out of his narrative to visualize Marina's state of mind...with its haunted lovers and dynamic use of color, frequently recalls Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."""|Fresh
The good thing about Lelio and Maza is that, where they could have fallen into the obvious and discursive complaint, they prefer to concentrate on the human (and intimate) aspects of Marina. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This movie has serious tartness and sharpness.|Fresh
...this eclectic cinematographic universe [is] spiced with touches of the masters actualizing not only its own artistic identity, but also its original influences. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Daniela Vega's star-making performance invests the film with emotional honesty and gives us a heroine worth rooting for.|Fresh
A story of grief, alienation and identity from a perspective rarely seen in any medium, this Chilean drama is easily one of the most important, and intimate, films of recent years.|Fresh
A sublime essay in the power of identity and how fiercely we cling to it.|Fresh
A singer and model by trade, Vega gives a performance that encompasses both Marina's ferocity and vulnerability. She ably advances the movie's best instincts.|Fresh
Lelio is a fine director and he handles this tragic story with tenderness and insight, and also with a firm control over the film's superb visuals. But the lasting impression is that of Vega's performance as Marina.|Fresh

Vega's performance is extraordinary and clearly the heart and muscle of the movie.|Fresh
A Fantastic Woman lets us see grief through a fresh pair of eyes.|Fresh
A Fantastic Woman trumpets its intentions in its very title. It should not have been necessary to exalt Marina in order to give her passion and turmoil their due.|Fresh
The movie may be fiction, but it's still telling a true story.|Fresh
A Fantastic Woman is highly recommended.|Fresh
... this compelling Chilean drama condemns hate and ignorance though a gracefully presented story about a grieving trans woman rejected by her deceased lover's family.|Fresh
But it's Marina's resilience - the essence of her being that inspired the name of the film - in loving Orlando in both life and death is the most endearing and touching thing you'll see.|Fresh
...a subdued character study that is, for the most part, held aloft by Vega's transfixing, thoroughly accomplished turn as the sympathetic central character...|Fresh
Societal stature and class rank make no difference in regards to how poorly Marina is treated by people, and one can safely assume that the issue isn't exclusively Chilean. Hopefully, A Fantastic Woman can also become an agent of education for America|Fresh
A quietly honest centre never wavers.|Fresh
[Vega's performance] anchors A Fantastic Woman in a way that cuts through politics and prejudice.|Fresh
At its core, A Fantastic Woman is the story of genuine love, something requires no definition.|Fresh
Vega brings a real power and torch-song majesty to her character's story, showing how creativity is born in those fearful moments when life refuses to provide us with a script.|Fresh
Penetrating and poignant, A Fantastic Woman speaks with Marina's powerful, daring voice, sounding a clarion call demanding she be treated with dignity and respect, and on behalf of all the LGBTQ fighters who refuse to be erased.|Fresh
Vega gives a stunning, at times emotionally raw performance in A Fantastic Woman, and Lelio tells the story with an uncommon amount of compassion.|Fresh
This film is a straightforward drama-with flourishes of surreal imagery-that's anchored by a star-making performance. You cannot take your eyes off Daniela Vega, and you may get the sense she does not want you to.|Fresh
This heroine has guts, a spine, a stoic presence that commands respect and empathy. As played charismatically, unsentimentally and exquisitely by Vega, it's impossible to write her off.|Fresh
This movie is a double of its own, with art and life reflecting one another so that we see not just Marina but also Vega for the fantastic women they are.|Fresh
Its clarity of purpose translates to an effectively lean and straightforward story of adversity and survival, in any language.|Fresh
Leaving so many plot strands dangling at the end of this promising but unfinished-feeling movie strands the audience just as much as it does the performers.|Rotten
"""A Fantastic Woman"" serves as a gentle reminder that we all contain multitudes."|Fresh
See me for myself; see me as I see myself. See me as I shall become. (The bold, bright flights of fancy are splendid and necessary.)|Fresh
Someone who can navigate all that, and remain resilient, assertive, even charismatic? Yes - she's a fantastic woman.|Fresh
Naturally in synch with the character she embodies with a moving mix of candour and courage, [Daniela] Vega's performance turns A Fantastic Woman into a painfully vivid tragedy, whose questions feel universal in scope.|Fresh
Lelio crafts a world that's realistically, distressingly unfair, violent and dark. But with Vega in the lead, her arresting screen charisma lends itself to some truly lovely and wonderful bits of fire and magic.|Fresh
A Fantastic Woman demands empathy for a very private woman whose most intimate experiences -- physical and emotional -- are very publicly exposed.|Fresh
To say that Vega is marvelous in her portrayal of Marina is nothing short of an understatement.|Fresh
A tremendous portrait of grief and prejudice.|Fresh
... one of those movies that derives power from its simplicity, conveying the discrimination against its transgender heroine in a way culls from a long history of such portrayals and yet somehow manages to feel fresh and relevant|Fresh
The magnetic Vega and the film as a whole deserve credit for conveying a message of acceptance that feels relevant without turning heavy-handed.|Fresh
Lelio approaches this material with sensitivity and empathy. There's restraint in his style, eloquent as it is.|Fresh
"""A Fantastic Woman"" is a remarkable film --- with a fantastic performance from Vega."|Fresh
What lifts argument into art is Ms. Vega's performance...|Fresh
Even when Lelio's treatment of Marina's situation can be clumsy, Vega's powerful performance adds authenticity and empathy.|Fresh
It's the ultimate proof of why we need to see more transgender actresses telling transgender stories, as Vega adds a beauty, poetry, and brutal realism that immediately forges a bond between the character, her story, and the audience.|Fresh
Sebstian Lelio's mesmerizing, humanistic, spot-on A Fantastic Woman, which heralds the arrival of trans actress Daniela Vega to the big stage.|Fresh
It's a reminder that as much as a film can open doors, there are places we're allowed into only by the grace of our hosts, and that permission can be withdrawn at any moment.|Fresh
Vega is terrific in the film's larger than life moments, but she is actually best when she underplays her role. She lends depth and shading to her character.|Fresh
Ultimately ...it doesn't shy away from depicting Marina's vulnerabilities, this is a film more about perseverance than victimhood.|Fresh
It's hard to imagine that a more beautiful screen romance will come along in 2018 than that between A Fantastic Woman's Marina (Daniela Vega) and Orlando (Francisco Reyes).|Fresh

Marina's dehumanization is gradually followed by her reclamation of her dignity. It's a toe-tingling triumph.|Fresh
Daniela Vega is striking in this transgender drama that has become an Oscar favorite for Foreign Language Film. It hits on many levels and remains compelling throughout for its themes and emotional resonance.|Fresh
A cry for compassion that marries the fierce conviction of Boys Don't Cry with the defiant self-expression of a Pedro Almodóvar drama.|Fresh
The kind of film that could change minds and open hearts.|Fresh
"""A Fantastic Woman"" can at times seem too invested in defining Marina not by what she does but by what is done to her."|Rotten
Superficial when it means to be elliptical and regressive in its attempts to promote pride and tolerance, Sebastián Lelio's film is beautiful but vacant, the type of melodrama that reminds us that they shouldn't always make them like they used to.|Rotten
It's heartbreaking, illuminating, and yes, fantastic, just to watch her live.|Fresh
Lelio's own stance, in short, could not be clearer; dramatically, though, it has a flattening effect, and we soon realize how few surprises lie in store.|Rotten
This film's heart is clearly in the right place, but to plant a marginalized character in the foreground of a narrative is not quite the same as making that character live and breathe.|Rotten
The characters... are human, fragile, afraid to see the foundations of their lives shaken. Death forces them to face what they have avoided for a long time... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Transgender rights get a punchy treatment in this effective drama.|Fresh
If not for Vega's vitality, and Lelio's unerring pace, the story might be unbearable. Instead, despite all the heartache, it plays as a study in the resilience that flows from a woman's fundamental decency.|Fresh

Sebastian Lelio's A Fantastic Woman is mesmerizing thanks to Daniela Vega's powerful, award-worthy lead performance.|Fresh
It's a good thing that Vegaare's magnificent performance is able to carry us through the finish line, but the commitment we once had for her truly heroic story is stretched a bit too thinly.|Rotten
The most plausible element, the foundation on which the movie rests and finally soars, is Vega's magnetic and meticulously controlled performance.|Fresh
The title of Sebastián Lelio's new film might seem a bit on the nose. It's a fantastic movie. Daniela Vega, the star, is fantastic in it. Quote me in the ads, with exclamation points if you must. My work here is done.|Fresh
One of the best performances of the year toplines Sebastián Lelio's stirring drama of grief and identity.|Fresh
Like Lelio's breakthrough film, Gloria, A Fantastic Woman is at its most compelling as a conventional character study of an unconventional female lead.|Fresh
When she finally achieves the small recompense she seeks, it's a visceral relief. I just wish Vega and Lelio let us in a little more to see her as an individual, aside from the hostility she encounters.|Fresh
In A Fantastic Woman, the substance outweighs the style, as this is an empathetic, wonderful and highly significant cinematic achievement.|Fresh

A Fantastic Woman feels cripplingly safe, opting for a declaration of obvious moral standards, underlined in bold, over penetrative study.|Rotten
[Daniela Vega] carries the weight of the narrative on her shoulders, delivering a captivating and raw performance.|Fresh
[Sebastián] Leilo displays a knack for getting under the skin of female characters who, for no fault of their own, find themselves somewhat marginalised by society|Fresh
It's a shame as it's all put together with a passion and verve redolent of Pedro Almodovar at his best, but it lacks his ability to sustain tension or lace moments of high seriousness with wild humour.|Rotten
Chilean director Sebastián Lelio and star Daniela Vega give the growing bracket of transgender drama a new, luminous touchstone work.|Fresh

[Daniela] Vega's gaze transfixes the camera with smouldering resolve, you can't take your eyes off her. She has the timeless and unplaceable beauty of a vintage movie star.|Fresh
The result is a rare movie about a trans person that - for better or worse - feels of its time, and not at least a half-step behind.|Fresh
Underneath the sparse plotting, there is so much playfulness and subversion going on in A Fantastic Woman that new strands could reveal themselves upon each new viewing.|Fresh
This aptly titled drama features a uniquely inspiring protagonist, showcased through the perceptive eye of a brilliant filmmaker.|Fresh
The filmmaking is expert. Watch how Lelio uses mirrors and windows, especially in the moments just after the aforementioned family attack.|Fresh

In the end, A Fantastic Woman proves a subtle and poignant statement on what we accept as 'normal'.|Fresh
Though emotionally charged & dramatic in its execution, Lelio takes creative risks, making for a film that while steeped in realism, has surrealist twists along the way & several visually striking sequences that provide a slight, if enchanting touch.|Fresh
Empathetic and engaging from start to finish, complete with an exceptional lead performance and one perfect song cue.|Fresh
A bolder, brasher film, fiery in comparison with Gloria's relatively tenderness, but anchored once more by a stellar central performance.|Fresh
With a remarkable performance by Daniela Vega, the film is a drama with suspense elements about the different forms that gender violence can take. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It may be a timely film, but it is its timelessness, as well as its depths of compassion, that qualify it as a great one.|Fresh
Ravishing.|Fresh
"After the exceptional ""Gloria,"" Sebastián Lelio gives us another stunning, deeply involving portrait of a woman with the borderline superhuman capacity not to hate herself for who she is, no matter who else does."|Fresh
