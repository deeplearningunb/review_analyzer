Welcome proof that returning to and expanding on a cherished story can still produce invigorating cinema that lives up to the ambition and artistry of the original.|Fresh
A perfect follow-up film that expands the themes of its predecessor for a new century.|Fresh
While it doesn't quite meet the heightened expectations, it's runs on plenty of nostalgia, twists and visuals.|Fresh
As the credits rolled, I sat in my seat both physically numb (as I said, cinema seats are unforgiving) and emotionally drained. This is sci-fi cinema at its absolute finest.|Fresh
Try to see this amazingly visual and immersive film on the largest screen possible. And yes, it will help to see the original first. The world is beautiful, layered and fascinating and the characters keep you caring every one of its 164 minutes.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is filled with an unparalleled artistry and is among one of the best looking movies ever to come out of Hollywood.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is an upgrade in most departments and is an utter joy to watch.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful, visually stunning film that captures philosophical themes and everything that made 1982's Blade Runner so special.|Fresh
For fans of the original, this beautiful masterwork extends the legacy ... Fans of films that are thought-provoking and lingering in both shot and effect, it's a must-see.|Fresh
My admiration for Blade Runner 2049 comes from a place that values Villeneuve's formalism, Roger Deakins' gorgeous cinematography, Dennis Gasser's remarkable production design, and even Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer's unrelenting yet immersive score.|Fresh
Denis Villeneuve flawlessly builds on the surrealism, mystery, and intrigue that made the original Blade Runner a cult classic.|Fresh
Women are aggressively objectified for the male gaze, while people of color are simply erased.|Rotten
In the end, Villeneuve's allusion to Nabokov confesses the derivative status of his sequel...|Fresh
Luckily, thanks to Denis Villeneuve's deft direction and an intelligent story, Blade Runner 2049 is not only a worthy sequel, it's an expansion and evolution of the mythology and themes.|Fresh
Convincingly well-structured, profound, purposeful and without a prosaic bone in its bountiful body 'Blade Runner 2049â€² is stunningly sumptuous Science Fiction theater for the thinking man and for the progressive machinery master-blasters as well.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is a movie drenched in frills, crafted with a discerning eye and a work of art that will be long debated years from now.|Fresh
With a style so simultaneously reverent of the past and boundary pushing today, the genius of craft behind Blade Runner 2049 truly is its greatest asset.|Fresh
Villeneuve has undeniably achieved something grand, making a sequel with insurmountable worth in its own right.|Fresh
Villeneuve's masterpiece is an impeccably realised, extraordinary sci-fi neo-noir that will be noted as one of the greatest ever blockbusters.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is a worthy successor to the original film, avoiding the mistakes of other recent revivals and bringing just enough new to the table.|Fresh
...lays out entirely new waves of questions that will be chewed on and puzzled over in the years and decades to come, assuring that it doesn't just fade away like tears in the rain.|Fresh
"I don't know that it's a ""masterpiece"" on par with the first one, but it's an entirely solid science fiction feature in its own right with a lot of intriguing ideas at its core."|Fresh
Though thematically ambitious and visually unmatched, Blade Runner 2049 isn't the kind of crowd-pleasing blockbuster filmmaking that routinely packs the multiplexes.|Fresh
Captivating visuals, a haunting score, and a cast that's uniformly at the top of their game make it more of an experience than a film. It's nothing short of an electric dream.|Fresh
Much like the 1982 original, this is a visual marvel - with director Denis Villeneuve meticulously crafting this futuristic world in great detail - although the narrative lacks the same spark.|Fresh
Any follow-up to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was going to be an uphill struggle.|Rotten
A perfect sequel and, arguably, film in recent memory.|Fresh
The world-building here is so intricate, so propulsive. It is almost entirely introspective, the film at times seeming to bob and undulate like an ice floe at sea.|Fresh
Perhaps Blade Runner 2049's biggest flaw is style over substance. Check it out for the beautiful look, but be careful diving below the surface.|Rotten
It's a stunning movie, it's epic, with an epic soundtrack.|Fresh
Villeneuve is easily up there with my favorite directors now.|Fresh
It's a movie with large spaces that gives us room, both physically and temporally, to let experiences sink in, to enjoy character moments, to worry about danger, and to appreciate nods (large and small) to the earlier film.|Fresh
... it's great to see a director and his crew being given the freedom to be eccentric, contemplative, and create a film that doesn't leave you when you exit the dark hall.|Fresh
Wallace's desire and K's secret are, of course, connected, because in this gorgeous new Blade Runner, the narrative slots neatly together in a way that's tidy but unsatisfying.|Fresh
Directed by Arrival maestro Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 is a film that, like all of us-human and replicant alike- actively wrestles with its own existence.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is all experience, sound and rain, but that may be fitting for an age defined by artificial living, electric dreams and lonely desires.|Fresh
Find you an android lover, curl up to a nice movie.|Fresh
It is a startling reminder that even in today's cinema, where CGI spectacles are commonplace, big budget films can produce remarkable works of art.|Fresh
Sadly, although the film has all the markings of a great sequel, it lacks any passion or sentiment for most of the story.|Rotten
"Look elsewhere for your fix, action junkies, and don't judge ""2049"" for what it isn't."|Fresh
Small miracles do exist in Blade Runner 2049, but the organic beauty and possibility they represent gets buried beneath ponderous ruminations and plot twists ripped from the pantheon of generic science fiction.|Rotten
"The failure of ""Blade Runner 2049"" is how it discriminates between men and women, and how that discrimination surpasses the distinction between human and machine. That failure leaves you with no hope for the future."|Rotten
As remakes, sequels and reboots continue to plague the art form, it's a pleasure to find one that feels like a labour of love. It's a sincere, interesting and compelling film.|Fresh
"Denis Villeneuve, the director of ""Arrival"" (2016) and ""Sicario"" (2015) is undoubtedly an extraordinary storyteller, and the multidimensional tale of the new ""Blade Runner"" is no exception. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Gen X was the original audience for Blade Runner, but this film is an insult to it, or maybe just an unnecessary recapitulation of how things are for that generation.|Rotten
If every new film made today is to a greater or lesser degree an echo box of past possibilities, what's notable is how much Villeneuve gives those echoes room to breathe and to be new.|Fresh
It's a very self aware continuation, but not a complete replicant.|Fresh
This movie is visually stunning. It is so beautiful. Every single shot in this movie feels like a work of art.|Fresh
[VIDEO ESSAY] All spectacle and no substance describes Denis Villeneuve's predictably overwrought yet lightweight sci-fi snoozefest.|Rotten
Like its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 is often difficult to enjoy as traditional entertainment yet impossible not to marvel at. And its merit will no doubt be debated for years to come.|Fresh
With it now reaching home media, it's time to ask: is it really that good? In brief: yes.|Fresh
It was a proper Blade Runner sequel...it did everything it needed to do, which was expand on the universe and tell a story that felt like it had to be told.|Fresh
Ravishing visuals, expansive worlds, performances that range from compelling to stunning.|Fresh

Blade Runner 2049 boasts impeccable direction and marvelous camerawork, on top of astonishing production design, visual effects, and music. However, when it comes to the film's thinly-stretched story, it leaves something to be desired.|Rotten
... complements the narrative arcs of its predecessor... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Villeneuve has created a genuinely thoughtful piece of sci-fi which escapes the gravitational pull of its inspiration to become something - to paraphrase Dr. Eldon Tyrrell - more Blade Runner than Blade Runner.|Fresh
It seems designed to watch itself even if no one showed up, like a rotating hall of mirrors. The film doesn't need us.|Rotten
... a logical follow-up to Villeneuve's moody, thoughtful sci-fi work Arrival.|Fresh
2049's future feels safer and cleaner, lacking Blade Runner's sensuous grime (there's not a single cloud of cigarette smoke), but its imagery is no less striking, particularly when Villeneuve and Deakins go wide with hypnotic vistas of a decaying Earth.|Fresh
"""Blade Runner 2049,"" like most sequels, feels hollow compared with the original. That said, it's still visually masterful and worth watching."|Fresh
It's an arresting blend of artistic and blockbuster sensibilities that will stand the test of time right beside its trailblazing predecessor|Fresh
Villeneuve sets a bar for sci-fi sequels.|Fresh

Do sci-fi fans dream of immersive future worlds, neon visuals scored by dark synth notes, and existential musings on what it means to be human? Yes, and they dream of Blade Runner 2049.|Fresh
It is richer in ideas than is the original film, though it lacks the iconic visuals of that first film did so well.|Fresh
This awe-inducing spectacle not only follows up on some major lingering questions, but also marinates longer on the original's heady concepts and gift for world-building.|Fresh
Sequels will come and go, and it might be some time before Hollywood throws this much money and this much prestige at a franchise staple like this. But at least we have this movie for now.|Fresh
Stunning visuals and potent storytelling combine for one stirring sci-fi thriller.|Fresh
In the end, for all its pleasures, it's difficult to view Blade Runner 2049 as anything but an elaborate echo of the original, neither true sequel nor reboot, unclear of its own identity.|Rotten
Beyond the thrill of seeing Scott's whole world resurrected in deep focus, there's a palpable absence of real feelings. Outside of K, we never seem to get close enough to any of the characters to really care about their outcome.|Fresh
This movie is obsessed with the idea of women, and I don't mean that in a good way.|Rotten

Best described as a drama as opposed to an action film, Blade Runner 2049 offers a chilling view of our future.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is remarkable in its willingness to embrace the original film's slow pacing and philosophical musings. But does it add up to more than just a succession of stunning images and thought experiments? It's difficult to tell.|Fresh
Why do producers spend millions on stars and special effects and forget to hire writers?|Rotten
Blade Runner 2049 honours and even amplifies the vision of its predecessor.|Fresh

"There's not going to be a more stunningly composed film this year than ""Blade Runner 2049"". Director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins have crafted a remarkable, immersive, sensory experience that embraces you wholly."|Fresh
Extends and deepens the 1982 original sci-fi noir, expanding on the apocalyptic cyberpunk vision and further exploring fundamental questions about what defines humanity.|Fresh
In the midst of its bleak dystopian vision, I found Blade Runner 2049's affirmation of the value of individual life to be surprisingly hopeful.|Fresh
Director Denis Villeneuve is the modern master of empty, thundering portent, and the dystopic future cinematic universe of Blade Runner gives him a gigantic space to practice his darkly didactic arts.|Rotten
Denis Villeneuve has created a modern work of art.|Fresh
Denis Villeneuve is fast approaching the upper echelons of modern-day directors, and his vision here is so well-defined and executed that it wouldn't be a far stretch to say he has already arrived.|Fresh

In whatever category you file it, 2049 is some kind of miracle: Its submersion in Blade Runner's themes and ambiguities, in its essential mystery, feels both familiar and new. And then it somehow goes even deeper.|Fresh
It's a story about fathers and children, about memories and war. But it's the love story - problematic sexual politics and all - that feels so real.|Fresh

[Mimics] the very particular look, sound and feel of the earlier film with eerie specificity ... generally hugely enjoyable ... story-telling is its weakest aspect ... the long third act has elements that are simply incomprehensible.|Fresh
[Villeneuve] capably traces the broad strokes of Scott's hard-boiled, mostly action-free original, but he bungles the buttoned-up postmodernism.|Rotten
The film dares to be ambiguous, but ambiguity is a bad fit with the current critical mood that art must be prescriptive rather than reflective.|Fresh
I found this new project to be vastly superior in story, acting, score and overall production.|Fresh
Denis Villeneuve's sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 science-fiction classic is very much the French-Canadian filmmaker's own work, building and maintaining a tension through the individual confronting an uncertain environment.|Fresh
I really, really liked looking at this.|Fresh
For all the admirable world-building and faithfulness to the style of the original, the story is almost a let-down and the soporific pace of the film makes it a tough slog.|Rotten
Sequels or remakes are seldom as good as the original film (like this year's 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle') but this is an exception. It takes the most intriguing elements of the original film and expands on them. Also, the acting is better.|Fresh
Two valid readings of the relationship between Joi and K instantaneously begin when she lights a drag of his smoke, and within that paradox is the heart of the entire Blade Runner universe.|Fresh
It is a studied and intelligent sequel that feels natural, but best of all it feels necessary, which is a mighty feat for a belated sequel.|Fresh
In the hands of a director at the top of his game, Blade Runner 2049 is a blockbuster with brains, heart and an abundance of style, that will certainly reward repeat viewings.|Fresh
This imperfect, messy, but energetic film deserves to be seen without any knowledge of the plot. The less you know, the better.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is made with great care, creating a close balance between the homage and a unique story, capable of moving and fascinating us almost as much as the classic from which it takes its name. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is everything you want it to be and nothing you don't.|Fresh
... a big-budget genre movie that respects its audience's intelligence, and an homage that adds something beautifully new.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 safely derives from the ancestral roots of Ridley Scott's iconic visionary opus without compromising its value in any way.|Fresh
It's great to see [Harrison] Ford revisiting one of his signature roles. His testy, cynical Deckard plays well against [Ryan] Gosling's smooth aplomb as they become unexpected allies in pursuit of the truth.|Fresh
2049 goes back to the near future and questions humanity itself.|Fresh
"Ultimately, you may find ""Blade Runner 2049"" something of a replicant itself. It looks right. It sounds right. It may even have some vestige of a soul."|Fresh
This is a stunning film that somehow makes you homesick for the original.|Fresh
Visually striking and surreal, consistently emphasizing the gritty style/production design over the slow-paced story. But it could earn cinematographer Roger A. Deakins his 14th Oscar nomination and first Academy Award win.|Fresh
"There is no question that ""Blade Runner 2049"" is intelligent, very impressive and often even moving. But it doesn't have the philosophical and theoretical depth of the original."|Fresh

... Villeneuve enters into a kind of cryptogram governed by the precepts of Jacques Lacan on the subversion of the subject and the dialectic of desire. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
On its own merits, Blade Runner 2049 is a very strong film; as a sequel, it's nothing short of brilliant.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling seems born for this hybrid role. His general monotone detachment works especially well here, and the subtle nuances he shows fits perfectly into the world first etched by Harrison Ford.|Fresh
Several actors in supporting roles give superb performances...|Fresh
Not only is Blade Runner 2049 a worthy sequel, you could make the case that it's better than the original.|Fresh
Time will tell if it's a masterpiece, but at the very least, Blade Runner 2049 is a worthy successor to a groundbreaking film.|Fresh
Someday on Blu-ray it will be the go-to movie for the attuned to float around in for almost three hours, getting stoned on the bitter and doom-laden toxic mood.|Fresh
The 163-minute show drags a bit in the last act, but aside from that - and the danger that techies may view it as a documentary - Villeneuve's remake is the slickest fantasy in many moons.|Fresh
A film that with no waste and is very enjoyable. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is the perfect example of a sequel done right.|Fresh
This is a rare sequel that enhances, arguably even surpasses, the mastery of its original. Harrison Ford dubbed it 'a cathedral' of a movie and he's right - this is one to worship.|Fresh
Though Villeneuve has brilliantly continued the technological and commercial world of Blade Runner, he cleared a lot of clutter. So the urbanist in me was disappointed by 2049. But will Blade Runner 2049 be worth it to the rest of you? Visually, yes.|Fresh
Worthy of the title 'Blade Runner' for the imagery alone, and worth your time even if the central conceit is somehow both convoluted and repetitive. See it on the biggest screen you can.|Fresh
... a quiet movie that never avoids certainties and very good action sequences. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
At 163 minutes, the film has a lot of room, and a lot of plot to fill it with, but the first 100 minutes are largely taken up with detective movie boilerplate.|Fresh
It's probably going to take another viewing to fully appreciate Blade Runner 2049. My gut reaction is it's a great movie bordering on masterpiece.|Fresh
An innovative film at a narrative and visual level and at the same time, as original as the prequel. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The sequel forges its own identity as a new and intriguing incursion into the metaphysical limits of science fiction. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An intellectually and emotionally satisfying film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A beautiful sequel that needs no comparison. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The creators of this film had to use old ingredients to reconstruct a rancid and insipid concept that even Ryan Gosling can't save. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
A valuable balance between the old and the new: it's loyal and at times faithful to Scott's film, and rather than an update, is an extension and an appropriation. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A very well acted film, where everything flows naturally making it complex and complete. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In its well-intentioned efforts to somehow match the impact of the original, this is a film that has become overblown, over-written and massively over-long.|Rotten
[Director] Villeneuve never strikes the moral terror that has distinguished his best films. . .Blade Runner's awesomeness is gone.|Rotten
Blade Runner 2049 is a worthy - and beautiful - follow-up.|Fresh
Denis Villeneuve & co. have constructed a follow-up of such satisfyingly detailed echoes, while still managing to retain an identity unique from the shadow under which it thrives. This might be Blade Runner 2049's greatest achievement.|Fresh
Visually, this dying future world is immersively hellish. Intellectually, though, its ideas haven't kept up with the rapidly evolving science-fictional conversation.|Rotten
More sequel than sequel.|Fresh
Spectacular enough to win over new generations of viewers, yet deep enough to reassure diehard fans that their cherished memories haven't been reduced to tradable synthetic implants.|Fresh
The film is mesmerizing to behold. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Though the film dazzles us with its hauntingly beautiful images, it disappoints with its lack of substance.|Rotten
"In any futuristic film, it always seems as if the acting takes a backseat to its visual features. In ""Blade Runner 2049,"" Ryan Gosling offers up his most complex and alluring work since ""Drive."""|Fresh
Is Blade Runner 2049 a masterpiece like its predecessor? Definitely not. It's not even a match for 2016's superb Arrival, the previous film from director Denis Villeneuve. Yet on its own terms, it's a dazzling achievement.|Fresh
. . . a big, bleak, bold, bad-ass beauty of an adventure.|Fresh
It's a must-see for fans of the 1982 original film, but there will be heated debates to come between its advocates and its critics.|Fresh
It does something sci-fi movies rarely do anymore, and sequels do even less: it shows us things we've never seen.|Fresh
Gosling and Ford are solid performers but it is Ana de Armas whose star is born.|Fresh
There's no conceivable way that a Blade Runner sequel could be more satisfying to anyone who loves its predecessor.|Fresh
So much is absolutely spellbinding, particularly the visuals and sound. Many scenes are hauntingly, eerily still.|Fresh
"""It's too bad she won't live"" - as James Edward Olmos' cop says at the end of the original - but it seems that Scott's punk-noir darling has."|Fresh
Here, the heroes, villains and themes and even the cyberpunk noir aesthetic feel familiar, but what this lacks in story originality, director Denis Villeneuve makes up in style.|Fresh
[2049] is long, laborious (in a good way) and lovingly detailed. It's also visually and aurally spectacular.|Fresh
For fans of the original, this should be enough to satisfy your soul (and nostalgia). For a new generation of viewers, the deliberate pacing will be a challenge, and in the end it's Deakins' framing, perspective and wondrous lighting that will carry them.|Fresh
What could have been another exercise in nostalgia instead took on a surprisingly defiant, idiosyncratic life of its own. It isn't perfect, but it's well worth your time.|Fresh
Where the original was a 1940's detective story set in the near future, this uses Hollywood's biblical Roman epics as a template and is built with a similar scope, weight and spiritual core.|Fresh
A film that possesses finesse in its visual discourse, a language that goes from dream to opiate travel, from dream to malice of an imagined situation in the head of a first time dreamer. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Blade Runner's world is grotty, grey, crowded and retrofitted. This future doesn't jettison the past. It cannibalizes it, from ancient ziggurats to Art Deco glamour.|Fresh
From the get-go, Villeneuve paints Blade Runner 2049 in his unique style. This is a rare, unhurried, futuristic film, much like Villeneuve's Arrival - philosophical and meditative.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 stands tall as one of the finest science fiction films of the last decade, even if it falls just short of perfection.|Fresh
It avoids strip-mining the original or recycling old ideas, and there aren't any contrived twists.|Fresh
We replicants, who are critics, think Blade Runner 2049 is worthy of intelligent perception.|Fresh
... Blade Runner 2049 will be remembered and studied, but best of all, will influence the future filmmakers... those of 2049. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A wondrous work of filmmaking, Blade Runner 2049 is something you can get lost inside for darn near three hours. Much like Villeneuve's Oscar-nominated work on Arrival, it's visceral, often spellbinding, even brilliant at times.|Fresh
Even if Blade Runner 2049 is technically a riff on a previous director's vision, it is a piece of filmmaking that towers above its peers.|Fresh
Just as Scott did in the original film, Villeneuve adopts an unhurried pace and some may find the plot rather too dense and convoluted. Probably it will take more than one viewing to make complete sense of it.|Fresh
It took 35 years for a sequel to be made to Blade Runner. But it's a great movie sequel that dishonors no one -- least of all the audience.|Fresh
As the plot twists and turns, the settings and gadgets create a retro vision of the future that's almost unnervingly recognisable as where we live right now.|Fresh
A visual display of sordid elegance and sublime beauty of dystopian nature. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Liberation doesn't have quite the same effect when it's done by white people, for other white people.|Rotten
Methodical and sad, it's a film with plenty of mood but little emotion, well made but frigid.|Rotten
As melancholy and bleak as Blade Runner 2049 is, when it ends, you want to see it over again, just to ease back into that mood pocket and savor its dark delicacies.|Fresh
This film is everything that cinema should be, both in terms of its plot and its audiovisual proposal, from beginning to end. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is heavy with portentous and pretentious hoo-ha.|Rotten
In many ways Blade Runner 2049 is a perfect sequel. Consider that a warning.|Fresh
An existential sci-fi opus.|Fresh
With the appearance of Harrison Ford, I notice that the mediocre bar is raised a little. But he's late in a film that seems eternal to me. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Visually stunning and soaked in atmosphere.|Fresh
... fans of the original should not be disappointed. With questions of human worth, value, choice, and sacrifice, it's what big sci-fi should be: holding onto humanity in the shadow of technology.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is a fantastic movie with bold ideas, visually stunning direction, and powerful performances. But underneath it all lies a Hollywood reboot.|Fresh
Despite all the overlaps, this is not a simulacrum of a Ridley Scott film. It is unmistakably a Denis Villeneuve film, inviting us to tumble, tense with anticipation, into his doomy clutches.|Fresh
There's a frisson in seeing fecundity exalted in a world bent on selling pleasure-sex.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 has been made with impeccable craftsmanship and taste, yet the film is so terrified of disreputability that it renders itself dead from the waist down, unable to derive pleasure even from a theoretically kinky robot three-way.|Rotten
Impressive and dazzling and takes nothing away from the iconic original.|Fresh
"When Leto uttered the line ""You do not know what pain is yet,"" I wondered if it had been re-purposed from Hellraiser."|Fresh
While [BLADE RUNNER 2049] succeeds in more complex world building, it doesn't achieve a depth of story that couldn't have been told in half the running time.|Rotten
The latest Denis Villeneuve achievement, Blade Runner 2049 is the rare sequel that both pushes the franchise to challenging new places and serves as a natural extension of what's come before.|Fresh
A film, like the replicants who populate it, that makes a perfectly compelling case for its own existence.|Fresh
Plays like a bloated director's cut.|Rotten
Blade Runner 2049 is breathtakingly dull...It barely has enough story to cover a 90-minute film let alone one that runs 164...It's punishingly slow, the performances are sullen and dour; nobody seems interested in being there...the film is a visual bore.|Rotten
Has some significant problems - but is also crammed with dazzling moments.|Fresh
"A motion picture of grand aims and elevated altitudes, ""Blade Runner 2049"" challenges in the best way, as emotionally resounding as it is visually remarkable."|Fresh
It takes on the themes and universe set forth in the original and builds on them, and manages to live up to the massive expectations that greet it. This is no replicant, it's the real deal.|Fresh
With this, there can be little doubt that Denis Villeneuve is one of the greatest science-fiction filmmakers ever - right up there with Kubrick, Fritz Lang, and Nolan.|Fresh
Is it blasphemy to suggest that Blade Runner 2049 is just okay and doesn't suck?|Fresh
Barely fresh. At 2:43 it's too long. Director Dennis Villeneuve is too in love with his effects and drags out his movie by half an hour. Not Blade Runner but blade crawler.|Fresh
I admire the hard work that went into this film by a team of people who are devotees of the original and strove to do it justice. Fans and admirers will weigh in en masse, I'm sure...but I found Blade Runner 2049 long and boring.|Rotten
...a rich, thought-provoking continuation that benefits from the passage of time.|Fresh
After the movie's sometimes taxing, 164-minute running time, I found that other more immediately pressing needs required attention.|Rotten
The narration of the film wins in suspense, intrigue, humor and emotion reaching an intense end with epic airs and reminiscences of western (futurist, of course). Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
To summarise, treat yourself this week with a trip to 2049. You may return with more questions than before you went in, but at least it'll make you think.|Fresh
I enjoyed this infinitely more than the original and I'm 100 per cent behind the thinking that Denis Villeneuve is the greatest filmmaker alive.|Fresh
A film that is pure escape, pure delight, a nighttime movie tour through the memory and the cinematics. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As to the those big questions ... Blade Runner 2049 is conclusive about most things, but also asserts its own set of questions. And that's not a spoiler.|Fresh
While it's part of the nostalgia-courting blockbuster machine currently dominating mainstream cinema, it isn't interested in simply being a well-made rehash.|Fresh
Against all the odds, Blade Runner 2049 is a majestic, uncompromising science-fiction epic that stands shoulder to shoulder with its predecessor as a film of wondrous images and thought-provoking reflections on what it means to be human.|Fresh
Everything is at full strength, and while it is by no means an action film, it is thrilling.|Fresh
Directed with more style than substance by Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 improves upon the original film, even if it cannot capture what made it so special.|Fresh
"""Blade Runner 2049""... is a film to savor and mull over."|Fresh
With more violence than the first film and a stronger emphasis on sex, this also lacks the underlying philosophical conundrums that made Blade Runner so lastingly powerful.|Rotten
... proof of how a sequel can be just as good as the original movie, even if released decades apart.|Fresh
The greatness of a film, it is known, is not measured by its budget, its duration or the prestige of its creators but by the artistic discoveries and, in this sense, Blade Runner 2049 intends more than it finally obtains. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
... profound without being pretentious... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The look of Blade Runner 2049 tops the dark chaos of Blade Runner. Roger Deakins' cinematography and Dennis Gassner's production design are beyond stunning. It's hard to imagine anyone topping them for the Oscar.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049, then, is undoubtedly the most gorgeous thing to come out of a major studio in some time.|Fresh
There's more to be said, and both Blade Runner films create a distinct world and people it, so to speak, with characters you won't soon forget.|Fresh
Technically almost perfect, but forced and solemn in excess. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is Gosling's, and while the movie is a bit bloated, it's both a worthy successor to the original and a chilling meditation on what it means to be human.|Fresh
Harrison Ford, for his part, is nothing less than a revelation.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is a stunner through and through, a film that works both as a continuation to an all-time classic and as a superior cinematic experience in its own right.|Fresh
When the script - FINALLY - gets around to Deckard, Ford props up the proceedings with some signs of life - but that energy is fleeting.|Rotten
So let's not call Blade Runner 2049 a sequel. Call it the spiritual successor to one of the greatest science-fiction stories ever told. And it lives up to that billing.|Fresh
Admiration for Blade Runner 2049 begins with ... the movie's world ... Unfortunately, admiration for this semi-spinoff/semi-sequel ... also ends with its world.|Rotten
Blade Runner 2049 really does look the part. The film is lovingly detailed, astonishingly lit and scored and designed in a way that manages to be both meticulous and pleasantly sparse.|Fresh
Enigmatic, continually intriguing, and at its heart, a noir film.|Fresh
It's indeed a shame that Blade Runner 2049 doesn't offer up enough food for thought to go with its visual brilliance.|Rotten
I didn't like Blade Runner 2049 very much in the hours after first watching it. I didn't like the way it resolved the previous film's storylines--how stolid it was in its exposition and how eager it seemed to talk about what was on its mind.|Fresh
The misandry-prone geek bros won't know what hit them.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel we didn't need, a film that mimics the original's style, but falls short of capturing its danger and romance.|Rotten
Director Denis Villeneuve and crew have lovingly embraced the weird, neo noir, sci-fi vibe of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner from 1982 and extended its bleak conception of the future to the mid-21st century.|Fresh
2049 is the ultimate successor to Blade Runner. It's the full realization of what Ridley Scott started building in 1982.|Fresh
By picking up the narrative baton that original Blade Runner director Scott carried for so long, Villeneuve immerses us in the hopeful reawakening to a future that beckons us to rush forward without fear.|Fresh
"It's Villeneuve's best picture to date, offering artful reverence to ""Blade Runner"" without altering its gorgeous, forbidding atmosphere and core sci-fi/noir appeal."|Fresh
Director Denis Villeneuve's visual stunner deftly expands the 'Blade Runner' universe.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is one of the brainiest films to come out of Hollywood in a long while, asking more questions about the meaning of life than it answers.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 may be breathtaking cinema, but it isn't great storytelling.|Rotten
Yet despite Ryan Gosling, a striking visual template and Harrison Ford reprising the role he played in the 1982 sci-fi classic, glitches mar this undeniably ambitious but drawn-out exercise.|Rotten
Ford doesn't enliven the film for nostalgic reasons. He brings fierce, potent energy to the role, capturing Deckard's suspicion of K, protectiveness about his past, and will to survive. In a career of iconic roles, this is among his best.|Fresh
Could Villeneuve match, let alone surpass, that original? Well, the answer is a resounding yes. ... Blade Runner 2049 is visually stunning, emotionally stimulating and -- at times -- emotionally devastating.|Fresh
In the pantheon of classic science-fiction films, if Blade Runner is No. 1, as some would argue, there's an argument that Blade Runner 2049 just might be 1A.|Fresh
It never properly creates its own world, the drama is plodding, and every character is a tiresome type.|Rotten
Barely fresh. 163 minutes of post apocalyptic eye candy and sci-fi sound and fury signifying not much.|Fresh
The film is no less sombre than its predecessor, and the glacial pace at which the characters walk and talk indicates that they know this full well. But the ideas aren't complex enough to justify the time spent unpicking them.|Rotten
Blade Runner 2049 gives us a hyper-realized aesthetic and tries to convince us that it has given us a world.|Fresh
It could stand to have as much clarity afforded to its narrative and thematics as to its visuals.|Fresh
Fans of Ridley Scott's landmark 1982 dystopian noir drama Blade Runner will be thrilled to find that director Denis Villeneuve has soaked his follow-up, Blade Runner 2049, in as much grime-and-neon atmosphere as the original.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling's lead performance is actually better than Harrison Ford's was in the 1982 film, which isn't a knock on Ford but rather a testament to his successor's gifts.|Fresh
The initial trepidation surrounding Blade Runner 2049 should be replaced by relief and exhilaration, as it's now clear that Villeneuve was the right man to helm such a risky project.|Fresh
See 2049 on the biggest screen you can possibly find. Let the stunning visuals overwhelm you -- Villeneuve is a brilliant craftsman.|Fresh
It's a film that's short of soul, and most of the original thinking was already done in Blade Runner 1, but it delivers a powerful impact in other ways. See it on an Imax screen if you can.|Fresh
Director Denis Villeneuve, who earned his sci-fi bona fides with Arrival, successfully replicates the cold austerity Ridley Scott brought to Blade Runner.|Fresh
A visually dazzling follow-up to one of science fiction's most iconic films.|Fresh
"""Blade Runner 2049"" is not just a movie but an event. Don't be the only human on your block not to see it."|Fresh
Villeneuve and company have cast a powerful and disturbing visual spell, thrusting us into a world compelling enough to get lost in.|Fresh
Replicant hunter uncovers a conspiracy that could change the world in an ambitious, uncompromising sci-fi adventure.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is chockablock with rich philosophical questions of what it means to be human and where the line between human and machine blurs into an unrecognizable haze.|Fresh
An improvement on the original-a thoughtful, visually striking, emotionally satisfying continuation of Scott's celebrated but rather muddled film.|Fresh
... a visual delight.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is a towering sequel to the science fiction classic. It is visually spellbinding, a dark odyssey that flirts with greatness.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is not only among the year's best films, but arguably one of the best sequels ever issued. Somewhere, Avatar's James Cameron is watching closely and scribbling notes.|Fresh
[A] miraculous, riveting cinematic achievement that does the impossible -- living up to the original film and even at times surpassing it.|Fresh
A movie for people who miss the voice-over narration. It turns poetry into prose.|Rotten
While Blade Runner 2049 may not end up being the classic the original is, in some ways it's as good of a sequel as you could ask for.|Fresh
"Somewhere in ""Blade Runner 2049"" is a terrific 100-minute movie struggling to get out."|Fresh
Moody, methodical and meticulous, with stunning visuals, strong performances and a sci-fi story that's more ponderous than thrilling.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 embraces the enormous shadow cast by Blade Runner 1982 by crafting a vast immersion in scale and vision.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is so good, I'd be happy for Denis to tempt fate and make another.|Fresh
A breathtaking sequel to the futuristic classic Blade Runner, the film soars on the wings of its stunning visuals and moody score. It's stunning!|Fresh
"Like the 20-foot-tall ballerina holograms pirouetting through its decrepit Los Angeles streets, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is hauntingly beautiful, technologically stunning and low on substance."|Rotten
An ambitious movie that deepens on topics of the first film, such as identity and artificial intelligence. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...a work that pays homage to its forebear while simultaneously using that material to push us into new and confronting places...|Fresh

Blade Runner 2049 is, hands-down, the greatest sequel in the history of cinema.|Fresh
In terms of the imaginative ways it expands on the themes of the first movie, it is the rare sequel that is at least the equal of its iconic original.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 honors the original in many ways - some small and some large - but it's not a soft reboot. It's a new story with new ideas and new purpose.|Fresh
Magnificently imagined, stunningly designed, and one of the best of the year.|Fresh
In the masterful hands of director Denis Villeneuve, the dystopian story does more than justify its existence, it cements itself as one of the best films of 2017 and Villeneuve as one of the most exciting directors of today.|Fresh
The tone? The giant scope? The philosophical underbelly? A compelling story? ... [T]he sequel lives up to its predecessor in all these ways and manages to stand on its own.|Fresh
Despite its blockbuster trappings, this Blade Runner is as much an art movie as the first one: slow, idea-driven, and often emotionally remote.|Fresh
Not since the great Mad Max: Fury Road has a game-changing conceptual vision landed on the big screen so fully and forcefully realised.|Fresh
The script contains enough core truths and grand philosophical concepts that no spoiler could touch them, such as the co-dependence of slavery and freedom, or the paradoxical way the future echoes and restates the past.|Fresh
This might be heresy, but I'll argue Villeneuve's sequel is a deeper and more engaging work than its progenitor, less concerned with action beats than with ideas, themes and character.|Fresh
One of those films where the sum of the best parts does give a huge cinematographic work. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It catches you and knows how to go further with what was proposed in the first installment, also proposing an enticing scenario for a possible third installment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Blade Runner 2049"" explodes on the silver screen as a stunning achievement..."|Fresh
... in Blade Runner 2049, Villeneuve has not just lived up to lofty expectations, but surpassed them entirely.|Fresh

... a superb action thriller, and a saddening parable about human existence and identity.|Fresh
If you don't value the artistry of Blade Runner 2049, you might not be human.|Fresh
A strange and beautiful beast indeed, Blade Runner 2049 is a science-fiction epic for adults, somehow released in 2017...Blade Runner 2049 dreams big.|Fresh
Visually stunning and ambitious sequel to the 1982 film has a cool performance from Ryan Gosling but is blissfully helped by its original star Harrison Ford, even if the two hour and 44 minute running time could definitely use some editing.|Fresh
It's a massive, epic piece of science fiction that keeps the audience engaged, entertained and stunned.|Fresh
"There are no new ideas here, poignancy achieved by rehashing moments of the original film with dollops lifted from Spielberg's ""A.I."" and Spike Jonze's ""Her."""|Rotten
...Blade Runner 2049 arrives at our doorsteps clocking in at 2 hours and 44 minutes. I dare say that very few of its moments are wasted, and, yes, it has been worth the wait.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 an enthralling science fiction tour de force that will only get better and more emotionally invigorating with each additional viewing.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is the rare sequel that surpasses a classic.|Fresh
Really pretty and intermittently poses interesting questions about where exactly the nature of humanity lies but at the expense of a compelling plot.|Fresh
Yes, this is a movie that takes itself very seriously, but it saves itself by taking its subject even more seriously.|Fresh
Fully fleshed out with a fierce imagination and sharp good looks, it doesn't matter if Blade Runner 2049 is a replica of an original model - it's even better than the real thing.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is excellent. Hampton Fancher and Michael Green's script continues to push the themes and questions of the original and finds a new angle from which to do so.|Fresh
We end up with an intoxicating, brain-melting yarn that, for all its pleasures, has ideas a little above its station. It's not Kafka. Then again it doesn't need to be.|Fresh
Chilling in its magnificence, but pretty much heartless.|Fresh
A brilliant new sci-fi benchmark, an epic movie yardstick against which future science fiction flicks will be compared and measured--it's the 2001 of 2017.|Fresh
What a remarkable film this is...|Fresh
Villeneuve crafts a movie both cerebral and sensuous, as puzzling and visually striking as its predecessor. The experience should be likewise revered by next generations.|Fresh
This worthy sequel is a feast for the eyes and ears. The heart? Not so much.|Fresh
For a bleak dystopian future, it sure is a beautiful place to visit.|Fresh
Get ready to see the perfect chill Gosling performance.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 not only succeeds at feeling like a necessary franchise revival, it also makes for a captivating standalone work of science-fiction.|Fresh
"The strength of ""Blade Runner 2049"" lies in its humanity. For a movie dealing mostly with artificial life, the film touches on such issues as memory, freedom of choice and the rights of individuals."|Fresh
Masterful in its craft and elegant in its message, it doesn't simply replicate the themes and ideas of the first film, but builds on them in ways that are both authentic and inventive.|Fresh
This is really Villeneuve's film: he surpasses even his own 2016 sci-fi Arrival with this stunning visual masterpiece.|Fresh
The best cyberpunk film since the original Matrix, and the best big-budget American science fiction film in years.|Fresh
A big disappointment. All the pretty vistas in the world can't enliven this protracted futuro-slog.|Rotten
An artistic as well as a philosophical triumph ...|Fresh
An extraordinary experience that will leave you open-mouthed with wonder. It deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible.|Fresh
In terms of a sequel besting the original, Blade Runner 2049 is not a unicorn. But it is a breathtaking, non-comformist achievement.|Fresh
"In a world filled with cinema replicants - sturdy, shiny, carefully engineered jobs that almost duplicate the look and warmth of a real movie - ""Blade Runner 2049"" is that rarest of sequels: An original."|Fresh
There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see.|Fresh
While Blade Runner 2049 is always something to look at, an overly elaborate script and some other bad habits common to today's sequel machinery - such as glaring product placement - have broken the Blade Runner spell.|Rotten
I don't want to ruin a single surprise in this remarkable film.|Fresh
One of the most deeply philosophical and challenging sci-fi films of all time.|Fresh
Denis Villeneuve succeeds in making 2049 feel distinct from Ridley Scott's film without sacrificing aspects that made the original so powerful.|Fresh
The special effects are impeccable, and include sequences that blur the line, evocatively, between what's real and unreal.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 does what very few sequels can accomplish: it deepens our appreciation of its predecessor, while carving out its own niche in the spaces of our own imaginations. And the visuals it paints are in a word: breathtaking.|Fresh
Everything wrong with sequels. There's not one original, awe inspiring moment in this film. It's cold, emotionally inert, uninspired and ultimately an empty experience.|Rotten
Blade Runner 2049 is bold, mesmerizing, and grandiose.|Fresh
... a moody, broody visual feast that taps into our unease about the advent of artificial intelligence.|Fresh
Less a generational iteration from its precursor than an evolutionary leap.|Fresh
This film is stop-and-point stunning. It is not without problems, however.|Fresh
If Blade Runner gave us the world, Blade Runner 2049 has come to fill in the universe.|Fresh
One of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
The brilliance of Blade Runner 2049 is that it makes the questions worth asking, positioning them in a menacing universe that's nevertheless a joy to revisit.|Fresh

This new Blade Runner dazzles the audience with plenty of staggering sights.|Fresh
While this might be a bold statement to make, I do believe that Blade Runner 2049 is better than the original.|Fresh
Not quite a classic, but this smart and visually stunning sequel will still be poured over by fans for years to come. If this was a poisoned chalice, Villeneuve has grabbed it with both hands.|Fresh
A meticulously made visual wonder that should put any other filmmaker dabbling in sci-fi futurism on notice.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is a triumph. As good as you want to be, and better than you could have expected.|Fresh
It's hard to make a case against reboots and long-delayed sequels when an exception to the rule like Blade Runner 2049 comes along. No cynical cash-grab or by-the-numbers repeat, this sequel manages to go deeper on the ideas from the first film.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 offers a stunning, immersive and fascinating journey through a strange and familiar world.|Fresh
Careful, dutiful, and beautiful, Blade Runner 2049 cannot achieve the sublime slipperiness of Scott's masterpiece. Whether it even needs to is up to you.|Fresh
It may seem premature to ascribe the word 'masterpiece' to a legacyquel of a heady sci-fi head-scratcher from the '80s, but its audacity and formal perfection - not to mention its thematic weight - leave no other alternative.|Fresh
Forty years after his death, people still argue over which Elvis, the slim young Adonis or the portly middle aged crooner, was better. Forty years from now, people may be having that debate about these Blade Runners.|Fresh
As the break between installments would suggest, it's a furthering of not just the original story but the original world, and that's quite an accomplishment.|Fresh
Rather than being overly beholden to its predecessor it immediately, but subtly, expands the world, while unraveling its mysterious and meandering plot in a surprising and refreshingly forthright manner.|Fresh
It organically expands and grows what came before. It's a deep, rich, smart film that's visually awesome and full of great sci-fi concepts, and one that was well worth the 35-year wait.|Fresh
"Will cinematographer Roger Deakins, having been nominated for an Academy Award 13 times, finally receive a damn Oscar? Yes. I hope it's yes. It should be ""yes."""|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 supersedes its predecessor in a number of ways, and is not only a brilliant sci-fi movie, but one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
"At the helm and in complete command of his movie with dark, ambient magic, Denis Villeneuve crafts a mysterious noir thriller the pushes existential boundaries, and nails the essence of the ""Blade Runner"" spirit."|Fresh
Villeneuve's dazzling sequel is on its own march to screen legend. Gosling and Ford are double dynamite in a mesmerizing mindbender that asks new questions meant to tantalize, provoke and keep us up nights. Would you have it any other way?|Fresh
Like The Godfather Part II, it's a sequel to a very celebrated film which may actually be better than the original.|Fresh
"A ravishing visual colossus, ""Blade Runner 2049"" more than lives up to its predecessor's legacy as a groundbreaking mixture of sound, images and mood."|Fresh
We've grown so used to lowest-common-denominator blockbuster cinema that it's almost shocking to watch a big science fiction movie, featuring these kinds of stars, swinging for the fences in this way.|Fresh
Even when its emotions risk running as cool as its palette, 2049 reaches for, and finds, something remarkable: the elevation of mainstream moviemaking to high art.|Fresh
It just has to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. Blade Runner 2049 is a narcotic spectacle of eerie and pitiless vastness, by turns satirical, tragic and romantic.|Fresh
Villeneuve's film is a direct continuation in every respect; it's difficult to imagine anyone - even Ridley Scott - making a better Blade Runner sequel.|Fresh
Visually immaculate, swirling with themes as heart-rending as they are mind-twisting, 2049 is, without doubt, a good year. And one of 2017's best.|Fresh
Better than the original.|Fresh
One of the most spectacular, provocative, profound and spiritually staggering blockbusters of our time.|Fresh
A voluptuous mood bath that's impressively sustained from beginning to end.|Fresh
"A visually breathtaking, long-fuse action movie whose unconventional thrills could be described as many things - from tantalizing to tedious - but never ""artificially intelligent."""|Fresh
I imagine most audiences will like the film ... I thought it was okay.|Fresh
Super-stylish and deeply human - even with androids and holograms around - the spectacular follow-up takes the detective story of the first film and turns it into a grand mythology of identity, memory, creation and revolution.|Fresh
The long-awaited Blade Runner 2049 delivers on the promise of the world of Blade Runner spending more time and visiting more corners of the now even more distant future.|Fresh
It looks great and boasts solid performances from an underused cast, but (like the original) it's a triumph of style over substance.|Rotten
A breathtaking, mind-bending cinematic experience.|Fresh
Blade Runner 2049 is a gorgeous return to a wearisome world.|Fresh
