Brisk and informative...|Fresh
We learn that Ruth Bader Ginsburg the Human, while immensely awesome, and yes, very petite, is not a cute or silly person. She's f***ing smart. Like, I'm-embarrassed-that-this-idiot-brain-is-the-one-I-have-to-use-to-write-about-her smart.|Fresh
It probably won't become the definitive film on U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life and 60-year legal career, but the documentary RBG is a satisfying start.|Fresh
RBG's superficiality makes it good background material about the subject and the forces that guided her life's crusade but the blinders it willingly wears represent its greatest flaw.|Rotten
