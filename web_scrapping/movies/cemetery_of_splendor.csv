Its succession of static, perfectly calm images establishes a spiritual mood that enables both the characters and their godly counterparts to exist within the same space. The result is a strange and beguiling meditation on identity.|Fresh
It's a funny film, it's a sly film, it's profound and poetic, brimming with mercurial wonder and vividness in strange and untrodden corners of consciousness.|Fresh
Many of its relaxed (or even tranquil) scenes provide an opportunity to absorb Weerasethakul's impressive eye for things and landscapes.|Fresh
Cemetery of Splendor demands patience, but is truly worth the effort.|Fresh
A uniquely beautiful spiritual film that centers around magic, healing and visions.|Fresh
"The echoes of Apichatpong's hospital-set ""Syndromes and a Century"" don't make this film look any more inspired."|Rotten
Cemetery of Splendour is the gentlest of war cries that rallies our personal consciousness to overcome the prescribed, unfeeling, unthinking doctrine.|Fresh
A film that shows the uneasy allegory of a country spoiled by the omnivorous military pressure on the defenseless civilian population. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What other filmmaker could create a tissue of metaphor, almost musical, from the hum of rotary objects?|Fresh
From the Thai arthouse director Apichatpong Weerasethakul, whose Uncle Boonmee won the Palme d'Or at Cannes a few years ago, comes another strange swooning dream, Cemetery of Splendour.|Fresh

It's hard to keep your eyes open while watching a still frame of a group of sleeping men, but manages to accomplish truly magical moments. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Not the best of Weerasethakul but definitely stands out and it's worth watching. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This film is so visually amazing that stimulates the audience's senses and imagination. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Weerasethakul's radiant images, magical digressions and surprise knob gags keep things fresh and alert, anchored by a sense of sighing sorrow for personal/political traumas.|Fresh
A film as gratifying as it's disturbing. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film as interesting as it's lethargic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film full of magical realism. You either love it or hate it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Thai director does it again with this beautiful and sensible film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An inteligent and universal film about empathy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
... the world we live in and the world we dream are one and the same.|Fresh
Calling the film supremely pleasurable and transfixing is undoubtedly selling it short, but as a first impression, it's absolutely enough.|Fresh
Quietly powerful and curious film.|Fresh
Apichatpong's unique breed of not-quite Magical Realism, then, enables his politics, rather than vice-versa. Even so, those who have trouble with Apichatpong's unusual formalism can grasp something more tangible this time around.|Fresh
Your mind is encouraged to put its feet up while watching Cemetery of Splendour. If you can do that, there is an ambience here that you'll gradually warm to. For many, however, it may prove too hard a sell.|Fresh
A fantastical and meandering exploration of the blurred boundaries between dreams and reality in a small, rural town in Thailand.|Fresh
Like most Weerasethakul films, it's both deeply rooted, and transcendent.|Fresh
Apichatpong's singular method is by now familiar: he looks at present-day realities through a prism of personal and collective memories, refusing to distinguish between the everyday, dream-states and dark fantasies|Fresh
It's possible to detect an allegorical discussion of Thailand's recent travails, but this distinctive blend of lyricism and mysticism is to be experienced as much as understood.|Fresh
What Weerasethakul creates on-screen could be described as a meditative space: he is using film not to dictate his ideas but to stimulate ours.|Fresh
A vital addition to a cogent body of work.|Fresh
History is everywhere in a typically cryptic and melancholy tale from director Apichatpong Weerasethakul that may still be his most accessible work to date.|Fresh
If Cemetery of Splendour is to be the last film Apichatpong makes in Thailand, he is saying goodbye with a masterpiece.|Fresh
If you give in to Cemetery of Splendour's slow, dreamy, dozy vision, you might end with a wide-awake cinematic jolt.|Fresh
A haunting, visionary work, balancing tremendous tenderness with quiet rage at governing powers seeking to silence dissent and bury great swathes of history.|Fresh
Cemetery of Splendour is a film that amazes us with few resources. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The cleverly made Cemetery is packed with so much wry humour, gentle mystery, and strange beauty almost anyone would enjoy spending some time there. Some.|Fresh
A poetic tissue of tropical moments, haunted by the irrepressible past.|Fresh
If there's such a thing as a party movie, then there is surely its opposite -- the kind of picture that lulls you into a meditative state.|Fresh
I'm starting to believe Weerasethakul is pranking us all. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Rotten
A slow and mesmerizing drama about the interactions of dreams and sleeping, healing and visitations by other-worldly beings in our everyday world.|Fresh
Apichatpong's latest venture into low-key magic realism is pleasurable but familiar.|Fresh
The strange and unusual are presented as normal, and we're begged to accept a world where the fantastical really can happen - where life really is bigger and more amazing than what's in front of us.|Fresh
The languidly paced movie requires some surrendering to, but it's well worth it.|Fresh
It's almost boring, until you give yourself over to the long, atmospherically still takes that cover every scene. The mood is serene, with an undertow of sadness.|Fresh
Cemetery of Splendour is too multifaceted a film to force viewers to ascribe to a single interpretation.|Fresh
Within its structure lies multiple intersecting and contradicting arcs of meaning, none of which cancel each other out but instead create a vast pool of associations.|Fresh
There's a cultural specificity to this movie that will make it, for Western audiences, even more enigmatic than it is in its Thai context. This ought not be a stumbling block, though.|Fresh
It's sweet, simple, potent theatrical magic-but it all signals, as so much does in the film, how much the past is visible in Thailand's present, and how much is invisible unless we're willing to look.|Fresh
The latest film by Apichatpong Weerasethakul will inspire both rapture in his avidly devoted claque and boredom in the less patient.|Fresh
The film succeeds in attuning its audience to a quieter way of life ...|Fresh
As is his custom, Weerasethakul addresses his nation's martial history with the lightest of touches.|Fresh
There is the notion that any individual or country can awaken from the darkness of its past.|Fresh
It's a vision that can make his movies, and especially this one, seem both inscrutable and strangely gratifying, and the experience of watching it is like dreaming with your eyes wide open.|Fresh
Asking what it all means is laughably irrelevant and Weerasethakul's Cemetery of Splendour teeters occasionally on the ephemeral even as its subject is the ephemeral nature of reality.|Fresh
This is the same wondrous journey on which Apichatpong sends his audience: inwards and downwards, to a place where the simplest rhythms of everyday life become hallowed and mythic.|Fresh
Jen's own loneliness and gentle spirituality are deeply affecting. It is such a strange film in its way, stranger still if you are not accustomed to Weerasethakul's work, and it needs a real investment of attention. But there is something sublime in it.|Fresh
Cemetery of Splendour is a whisper of a film that can only cast its spell if you let your breathing slow and give yourself over to the urgency of its spectral dimension.|Fresh
If you are susceptible and trusting enough to let the film gently occupy you, you will have something glorious and quiet to keep for yourself. Just please, for the love of all things holy, of which this film may very well be one, see it in a cinema.|Fresh
Weerasethakul's films have always been marked by their great tenderness, unobtrusive rigor, and desire to splice the straightforward with the cryptic, with Cemetery of Splendor one of the purest, most focused expressions of these concerns.|Fresh
To watch Cemetery of Splendor is to witness one of our finest filmmakers putting a spell on us. I can't say what everything in this elliptical movie means. But I sure know how it feels -- and it feels astonishing.|Fresh
The cinematography by Diego García enhances the offhand lyricism of this lovely, memory-steeped meditation.|Fresh
Weerasethakul films the Thai landscape and village spaces, their tones of light and color, with a poised and painterly eye, keeping the camera still and the action quiet as if to invite elusive spirits to inhabit the image.|Fresh
It's a beautiful hallucination, life and death nestled in the wonders of nature.|Fresh
[Apichatpong Weerasethakul's] latest film is as enveloping as anything he's ever made.|Fresh
Calm and quiet, but nicely paced.|Fresh
"[Sundance 2016] Heady but not self-serious, the beautifully strange ""Cemetery of Splendor"" holds a welcome lightness and humor alongside its thematic pathos."|Fresh
It is characteristically slow and measured, combining a profound sense of melancholy with a light touch, blurring the boundaries between waking and sleeping, dream and memory, past and present in the most relaxed, quotidian way.|Fresh
Both a film of resistance and an openly escapist experience, Cemetery of Splendour envelops you in immediate reverie, pulling you in with its quiet rhythms and cadences.|Fresh
The placid, normal-seeming exterior seems appropriate for a film that is about digging beneath the layers, digging to the past, digging to the subterranean heart of ourselves.|Fresh
The latest gently hypnotic cinematic enigma from the Thai writer-director Apichatpong Weerasethakul.|Fresh
