'The Guilty' finds itself in its ambiguity and in the unpredictable result of its calls, as well as in the little conformist description of its hero, its best tricks. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

The Guilty is a bit of a gimmick film, but proves to be a sensationally effective one thanks to the combination of Moller's gifts as a filmmaker and the wonderful performance by Cedergren as the antihero at the center.|Fresh
Director Gustav Möller might be a hypnotist. The Guilty is gripping tragedy, and is strongest in its focus on sound and storytelling.|Fresh
A lethally effective procedural thriller. Very highly recommended.|Fresh
The Guilty should stand out as one of the best thrillers of the year for those lucky enough to catch it.|Fresh

Finding humanity in difficult places, The Guilty brings an unusual amount of emotional nuance to bear for this type of thriller.|Fresh
Overall, however, the story works. It has emotional power despite the awkwardness of the story, and the limitations of the setting in which it is filmed.|Fresh
Unfortunately, The Guilty has several aspects that turn its back on plausibility. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

The Guilty is an entertaining and inventive thriller that contains a few interesting twists and some top-notch performances and sound design.|Fresh
"Taut, Sharp ""Guilty"" a Winning Thriller."|Fresh
A taut thriller that's an exercise in steadfastly-driven anxiety, the odd bleakly funny line giving us a moment's respite. Jakob Cedergren is extraordinary as emergency dispatcher Asger, becoming trapped in a web of assumptions spun himself from hubris.|Fresh
The narrative is full of emotional landmines that catch us off guard, sensitively exploring the characters and their internal lives.|Fresh
Reality meets fantasy in this well-scripted, well-acted, cautionary tale about truth and lies.|Fresh

Uncinematic But Riveting|Fresh
Taut abduction thriller The Guilty pares drama to its bare bones and fires up the audience's imagination in the process.|Fresh
Make the right call and watch this immediately.|Fresh
The Guilty stays afloat, but it never builds to the armrest-clutching peaks of suspense that the premise promises.|Fresh
Godard said that all you need to make a film is a girl and a gun. Well, with his smart and mercilessly gripping abduction thriller, the Danish director Gustav Möller has pulled it off with a middle-aged man and a hands-free phone.|Fresh
It provokes ... questions without resolving itself too much, though the ending seeks a sort of comfort the rest of the film doesn't suggest is even possible.|Fresh
Echoes of Dog Day Afternoon and Locke reverberate around this claustrophobic thriller, which is tautly plotted, precisely paced and grippingly played by Jakob Cedergren and his unseen co-stars.|Fresh
Tells the viewer about intense events more than it shows them, but it tells just enough to paint an evocative, unsettling, and nerve wracking thriller that's unfolding in the mind of the protagonist and the viewer with the similarly terrifying ambiguity.|Fresh
Patience is a virtue in The Guilty, and the payoff is phenomenal.|Fresh
The Guilty will keep you guessing.|Fresh
It's interesting how a film with so few elements can hit so hard but it does, you're next to Asger, trying to save lives feeling desperation and the ticking of the clock.|Fresh
The Guilty is a clever, thoroughly engrossing film from Denmark that marks the directorial debut of Swedish-born Gustav Möller, who also co-wrote the screenplay.|Fresh
Keeps you on the edge of your seat thanks to Jakob Cedergren's engaging performance and the vital sound editing by Oskar Skriver. Regardless of where you think the film is going, Möller has a few tricks up his sleeve that you won't see coming.|Fresh
"Sure, it's derivative, but if you ask, ""Was I entertained?"" I have no choice but to plead ""Guilty."""|Fresh
Builds to an explosively emotional climax that had me choking back tears as it delivered one gut-wrenching punch to the stomach after another.|Fresh
Like the film, Cedergren's expressive performance keeps the audience guessing without resorting to cheap manipulation.|Fresh
The Guilty is a marvelous debut from Swedish director Gustav Möller, who gets it. Sometimes, we don't have to see everything to be impacted meaningfully.|Fresh
As a study in acting, The Guilty is without sin. As a study in humanity, though, the film is hard to take.|Fresh
Even though the entirety of The Guilty is set in two rooms within a single location, the film is an intense thriller and a twisty mystery.|Fresh
The Guilty beautifully demonstrates how people can act with absolute conviction even when they don't have the full picture of a situation, and the monstrousness this can in turn lead to.|Fresh
A project like this lives or dies on its acting, and Cedergren's bravura performance - cocky one moment, despairing the next - will make you ignore the plot's contrivances.|Fresh
Tight, efficient thriller set in a single location keeps us riveted, with more twists than its simple premise would suggest.|Fresh
The Guilty is an exquisite reminder that all you need is four walls and a great performance.|Fresh
Jakob Cedergren's performance is the reason why this film is so compelling.|Fresh
Clever sound design helps sculpt the clockwork narrative. The best stories are the ones that unfold in your mind.|Fresh

"""The Guilty"" provides a master class in low-budget yet high-concept independent filmmaking. It's riveting."|Fresh
It's a clever enough variation on a genre, done with a genuine sense of verve - the sort of rough gem you don't want to keep on hold.|Fresh
Unfolding in real time, this immediately involving story bends and turns in surprising, sometimes horrifying ways.|Fresh
There's a limit to the film's effectiveness being set entirely in the glass corridors of the police station. Scenes that rely heavily on intricate sound design really pop, but the visuals (cumbersome close-ups, tepid two-shots) lack the energy to match.|Rotten
"Gustav Möller makes his directorial debut taking a page from 2013's Tom Hardy starrer ""Locke,"" where one man faces a crisis of conscience during a series of phone calls in real time...a nerve shredding thriller that also invites serious introspection"|Fresh
A tremendously involving film which will keep you guessing all the way up to its shattering conclusion.|Fresh
It turns its cramped, claustrophobic confines not only into a virtue, but its biggest white-knuckle strength.|Fresh
It has something to offer even those viewers who are sick of stories about dirty cops in need of redemption.|Fresh
Möller makes a whole lot out of very little: a whole lot of dramatic forcefulness out of the most simple and basic of elements, a solitary man struggling to do the right thing.|Fresh
Möller's innovative and claustrophobic thriller is an eerie treat that makes its audience feel complicit in the narrative.|Fresh
Moller delivers a fascinating character study to go with all the twists and turns.|Fresh

Möller's direction allows us to truly feel Asger's desperation.|Fresh
...a remarkable, must-see thriller, and one of the strongest narrative features of the year to date.|Fresh
This polished, well-calibrated thriller is a best-in-class showcase of the possibilities of cinema even with the most limited of resources.|Fresh
This gripping effort commits to its concept from start to finish, particularly in its claustrophobic visuals and uneasy mood.|Fresh
Möller squeezes every drop of tension out of the concept, and then finds ways to suck the air from your lungs again.|Fresh
The film is an impressive tonal balancing act that gives equal attention to both its rapid, frantic thriller and its intimate, opaque character study.|Fresh
The Guilty is an exhilarating, minimalist thriller that effectively sinks its hooks in, despite its bland, melodramatic title.|Fresh
Above all else, The Guilty is an acting showcase for Cedergren, whose has a considerable presence in European film and television but has yet to gain visibility in the English-language world.|Fresh
A claustrophobic thriller that finds fascinating ways to transcend, spiritually, its confines.|Fresh
"""The Guilty"" unravels a pair of mysteries, slowly peeling back the layers of both Iben's story and Asger's. In its tight 85 minutes, the film parcels out answers in each, with many of the revelations earning a gasp."|Fresh
The Guilty is a simple, but captivating thriller. However, it is difficult to get on board with the lead as a tragic hero due to his murderous actions.|Fresh
A high-concept, low-budget and skilfully muscle-tensing Danish thriller to which you can imagine more than a couple of eager Tinseltown execs angling for the remake rights.|Fresh
The single-location thriller conceit can often end up playing like a low-budget gimmick rather than a creative choice, but [director Gustav] Möller uses it to create a film that feels taut and claustrophobic.|Fresh
It's an ask, commercially: wider audiences usually express a desire to leave their office, not enter a new, smaller one, in their leisure time. But this is almost perfect for prestige cable, where connoisseurs will rightly view Möller as a name to watch.|Fresh
In his feature debut, filmmaker Gustav Moller masterfully ratchets up tension without the benefit of the usual visual aids, forcing viewers to dust off their imaginations and put them to work with chillingly effective results.|Fresh
Despite a limited setting, Möller makes the most of his drama, keeping the action tense due to a powerful story and a tremendous performance from lead actor Jakob Cedergren.|Fresh
