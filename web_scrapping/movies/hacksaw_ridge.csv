Hacksaw Ridge is a movie for anyone who has felt like an outcast. It captures the feeling of having to defend one's values and stand by one's convictions, looking left when everyone is telling you to look right. It's brutal. Tense.|Fresh
"After Garfield's Jesus figure spends half the movie telling the higher-ups he's not crazy and that he believes killing is wrong, he announces, ""I never claimed to be sane."" That must be how Mel Gibson gets things done, too."|Rotten
It is cruel, violent, unbearable and effective. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
On a week where the recent Marvel superhero film is also being released, Hacksaw Ridge is the real superhero film; one about a deeply religious, family man, pacifist that saved numerous lives without ever touching his rifle|Fresh
The alternating action and suspense are just enough to keep it afloat, but not enough to make it fly. A solid three stars.|Fresh
Sharp dialogue and bloody battle scenes.|Fresh
It's a cracking story and impressively executed by a director clearly going out of his way to show he has lost none of his passion for film-making and for action in particular.|Fresh
It's a technically marvelous film with some surpassingly dumb moments. It's a movie that seeks to honor an honorable man, but does so at the expense of other honorable men. Hacksaw Ridgeis a flawed film from a deeply flawed filmmaker.|Rotten
There are patchy moments, and one can argue that there are two separate movies in one - before the war and during the war. Gibson hasn't shot a movie in 10 years, but it's clear he hasn't lost his touch.|Fresh
It's a story that's tough to fathom given what's at stake, but Gibson skillfully of pulls it off...|Fresh
This film is harrowing, to be sure, but expertly drawn in the service of a great and remarkable true story.|Fresh
This ethical and philosophical quandary, of violence begetting enlightenment, is the soul of Gibson's artistry.|Fresh
We each decide where we draw the line, and while Hacksaw Ridge is an interesting film, it isn't so good that I'd suggest you cross yours.|Rotten
Hacksaw Ridge is a bloody, pulsing account of the WWII Battle of Okinawa through the eyes of a conscientious objector and field medic named Desmond Doss...|Fresh
Such an incongruous and praiseworthy product of the fallacious American militarist alibi that makes incomprehensible many of the signs of support after the premiere. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The effect of seeing that character's (Doss) unwavering, steadfast faith instead of the inner struggles it must have taken to get to that point misses a big opportunity for teaching and discussion.|Rotten
Hacksaw Ridge isn't a great movie, but it's a very solid and satisfying one.|Fresh
This is a film that more than matches some of the best war films. It's a movie about strength of character, belief and faith and Gibson has delivered another cracker.|Fresh
Garfield internalized Desmond and what we get is an outstanding portrayal of an earnest, humble, sweet, vulnerable, committed and brave young man who loved his neighbor.|Fresh
The weakest of this year's nine Best Picture Oscar nominees may not deserve its lofty spot, but it's still a fairly effective movie in its own right.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is a worthy honoring of the real-life Doss -- portrayed by the British-raised Andrew Garfield -- even if it does feel, at times, as traditionally melodramatic as your standard 1950s MGM big-screen release.|Fresh
An imposing war film that is very close to the classics of the genre and the spectacular return of Mel Gibson to the direction. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Gibson's vision of war is bloodthirsty and realistic, but hopeful. Seeing kindness and bravery, self-sacrifice, and selflessness in such a brutal context is refreshing. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's no doubt that this is confident, striking, film-making and if it merely serves as the final step in Gibson's rehabilitation and allows him to forge ahead with his new career as a director of true vision and power.|Fresh
Flawed, but entertaining, Hacksaw Ridge celebrates a pacifist in a time when killing was currency, and is a welcome reminder of the brutality of the battlefield in our own modern times, when war is fought at the push of a button.|Fresh
It's a good film, not a great one -- but a wise one for Gibson, and an interesting one for the current political climate.|Fresh
In these troubled times, we could do worse for a hero than a man who put his enlistment papers where his mouth is and saved scores of lives.|Fresh
A film with a lot of muscle, full of testosterone and as correct as patriotic. In conclusion: Hacksaw Ridge is effective...to a certain extent. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Of the largely antipodean supporting cast in this US-Australian co-production, only Palmer and Weaving really stand out.|Fresh
It's hell with bells on.|Fresh
[A] simple but powerful true story ...|Fresh
Gibson's robust directorial technique brings an undeniable punch to the combat scenes ... Elsewhere in the film, however, there's a sledgehammer lack of subtlety that is only partially mitigated by Andrew Garfield's impressive performance.|Fresh
Cornball heroism at its most righteous and manipulative.|Rotten
"If they gave out awards for ""most movie in a movie"", then no other movie need turn up."|Fresh
Gibson's film is clean, sober and shot through with a respectful piety, but somehow this scarcely believable story manages to feel a little flat and somewhat predictable.|Fresh
Mel Gibson's career rehabilitation continues. This is a gripping and ultimately powerful tale.|Fresh
A rousing tale of Pacific War heroism that has more in common with jingoistic Wayne staples such as Sands of Iwo Jima or The Green Berets than anything in the 21st century, this is wearily formulaic film-making.|Rotten
It's a thrilling - sometimes unwatchable - action film but has a undeniable nobility at its core.|Fresh
A blunt, brutal, bloody mess of a movie that displays the full range of Gibson's skills as a chronicler of eye-watering suffering on the battlefield and his propensity for corny mythmaking off it.|Rotten
As a director, Mel Gibson is great at telling vivid stories that evoke intense feelings. And Andrew Garfield delivers another remarkably internalised performance that resonates strongly.|Fresh
Garfield, previously so passive, proves a surprisingly viable hero in all this mayhem, performing breathtaking acts of courage that one instinctively knows must pale next to the horrors of the real thing.|Fresh
While a biopic doesn't usually include such direct nods to the people that it centres on, here, it makes all that you've just watched appear so much more powerful and moving and will have you thinking about it for days after you've seen it.|Fresh
Vintage Mel-odrama.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is an old-fashioned war film, melded with a kind of new-fashioned explicitly violent drama.|Fresh
Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best Second World War movies since Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line. It is also a wildly contradictory affair, combining folksiness with a pathological quality.|Fresh
A taut, emotional, must-see.|Fresh
A sterling modern war picture with an intriguing moral twist.|Fresh
A godsend as Gibson's peaceable pilgrim, Garfield imbues Doss' gangly mannerisms and corn-fed dialogue with a winning mix of Gump-speak sweetness and self-certainty.|Fresh
Doss's truly Herculean endeavours rise above the clichs, providing depth of drama and character.|Fresh
Occasionally soapy on the homefront but cataclysmic in combat, this is a worthy addition to the WWII canon.|Fresh
It's extremely simplistic, but it's also rousingly effective.|Fresh
Gibson's work would be for nought if not for Garfield's moving portrayal of Doss as a man who abides by principles more enduring than those set by the United States Army.|Fresh

A war film with such strength and conviction that when you finish watching it, you are convinced that it could only have been directed by Mel Gibson. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Beatified and blessed by the camera, Doss is another holier-than-thou hero in another of Gibson's violence-as-a-means-to-salvation big-screen sermons.|Rotten
The horror of war, at least for the boots on the ground, has seldom been more apparent. You leave the theatre more than a trifle stunned.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is both a moral twist on the traditional war story and one that indulges in many of its clichs. Therein lies the problem.|Rotten
This is one of those films where knowing how it ends makes it better.|Fresh
War truly is hell in this World War II biographical drama as the film's subject, decorated combat medic and pacifist Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), is caught up in horrific carnage that can outweigh the storytelling.|Rotten

One of the most striking war pictures America has made in years: morally troubling and coolly jingoistic in more or less equal measure,|Fresh
Gibson has boldly presented a story of powerful relevance, a declaration not only of faith but faith within a hostile world that looks to break a spirit that is unbreakable.|Fresh

An excellent film, probably the best one Mel Gibson ever shot so far. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

At times overly violent, and with clunky exposition, Hacksaw Ridge is also remarkably realistic, as visceral an experience in a theater that you are likely to see all year.|Fresh
Trying so forcefully to evoke a reaction isn't always a flaw, and pays off when the movie's second half comes around, but Gibson's indulgences are always noticeable.|Fresh
an intriguing mix of the conventional and the unconventional, worked over in broad strokes and thorough interwoven with issues of family and faith and perseverance and self-sacrifice and the will to live|Fresh
"""Hacksaw Ridge"" relies on strong performances and brilliant storytelling to tell the story without being heavy-handed."|Fresh
Gibson certainly covers the broad range of the human condition, from purity to corruption.|Fresh
Gibson has clearly lost none of his talent for cinematic spectacle, and Hacksaw Ridge invariably looks incredible.|Fresh

The film is a clear allegation against wars, where all the combat scenes are hallucinating. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's an uncommonly bloody -- and still somehow sensitive -- telling, with the terrific Andrew Garfield, as the aw-shucks hero, mostly mixing and matching with a host of grand actors from Gibson's homeland.|Fresh
Visually stunning, mercilessly bloody and utterly moving.|Fresh
Gibson's continued pouring over the blood-soaked effect of close combat doesn't advance the narrative as much as it announces the continued obsessions of its beleaguered progenitor.|Rotten
One can easily be led to believe this is just another of those green recruit goes to war and grows up stories. It is that, but so much more. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
An amazing true story (Hurrah!) not told very well (Hiss!) - a war movie at war with itself.|Rotten
... Hacksaw Ridge feels like a competent execution by Gibson as he flexes a cinematic muscle that may have come close to atrophying from being unused.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is the best war film since Saving Private Ryan, and Mel Gibson's best direction since Braveheart. Although it takes a while to warm up, when it finally does, the result is impressive and definitely memorable. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's an incredible tale, superbly told and finely acted by Teresa Palmer as Doss' wife, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths as his parents, Vince Vaughn as his platoon sergeant, and most of all by Garfield.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is beautiful and brutal, and that's a potent combination for a movie about a man determined to serve his country, as well as his soul.|Fresh
While the war scenes are intense, with over-the-top gore, this is not a typical war film. This is a unique film about the horrors of war, pacifism, faith and incredible heroics.|Fresh
A morally repugnant bloodbath from its shallow, sermonizing first act to its ferociously brutal finale.|Rotten
If any filmmaker is ruthless enough to make war truly look like hell, it's Mel Gibson. We saw what he did to Jesus. You can imagine how Gibson cranks the meat grinder with hordes of World War II soldiers, even in tribute to a pacifist.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge, the first movie Mel Gibson has directed in a decade, is about as Mel Gibson as you can get: grisly, devout, and patriotic, with a deeply complicated core.|Fresh
This is watchable enough if not quite some biopic classic.|Fresh
Gibson's shrewd sense of where the emotional beats are located carries the story through to its end.|Fresh
Instead of a war film about a brave hero's comeuppance, Gibson has remade his Christ film, this time with his martyr in khaki.|Rotten
An adrenaline-charged World War II story revolving around the nonviolence of a Seventh Day Adventist conscientious objector.|Fresh
A fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face - a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd.|Fresh
...like looking for peace inside the barrel of a gun.|Rotten
Intense and viscerally stunning, idealized and idiosyncratic, it illuminates the first conscientious objector awarded the Medal of Honor.|Fresh
Andrew Garfield speaks with a slow drawl and comes across as a touch dopey but it's a good fit for the character. He is a man driven by his beliefs rather than common sense.|Fresh
Gibson is giddy to once again be granted the all-mighty power to indulge his love of faith-based martyrdom.|Fresh
A crowd-pleasing conventional war drama.|Fresh
It's an amazing story well worth telling, and it's surprising it took 71 years for someone to tell it. And if this is what it took to get Mel Gibson in moviegoers' good graces again, so be it.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is a fine motion picture, one whose themes and ideas obviously speak to the filmmaker, and if Doss' story has helped change him as far as being a decent human being is concerned, that makes it all even better.|Fresh
The performances here keep the film grounded, notably Weaving, typically excellent, and Garfield especially up to the task of layering Christ-like grace notes atop a character who might have... come off as a beatific hillbilly|Fresh
Fans of hardcore battlefield action will find plenty to enjoy in Hacksaw Ridge, but those seeking emotional enlightenment will be disgusted (and bored) by Gibson's return to the director's chair.|Rotten
"""Hacksaw Ridge"" is the best movie I have seen this year. Some will not be able to watch the film because of its intensity and war violence, but for those who can it is an amazing story of faith, courage, love and patriotism."|Fresh
It's a blunt-force, but highly effective treatise on the horrors of war as well as those who rise above the brutality to maintain as much humanity as one can on a battlefield.|Fresh
As director, Gibson's approach is bold and fearless; this represents his best work to date behind the camera.|Fresh
It definitely out-Ryans ol' Saving Private, but the goal is questionable; there comes a point when most viewers will avert their eyes (and hence stop being viewers) just for a respite.|Rotten
It's hard not to be impressed by Gibson's efforts at recreating the Okinawa battlefield, or by Garfield's endearing, committed portrayal of a man who stuck to his code.|Fresh
For the sheer spectacle of the battle scenes, Hacksaw Ridge will go down as one of Gibson's finest contributions to cinema.|Fresh
The war is depicted as Hell incarnate, with a great deal of focus on apocalyptic eruptions of flame and people consumed in fire... [R]emarkably realized and recalls the finest moments of Gibson's earlier directorial work.|Fresh
What [Desmond Doss] encountered in fulfilling his faith and duty is movingly depicted in the film, but it's the emotional undercurrent that makes Hacksaw Ridge extraordinary.|Fresh
While the message might not be subtle, it's driven home with heartfelt conviction.|Fresh
Gibson makes his case that the best humanity can offer often arises amid the worst that humanity can inflict. There's no twisted pleasure in the making (or viewing) of this violence, only a solemn acknowledgment of the awful truth about war and bravery.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is a grisly WWII movie that excels as an action/thriller, but has mixed success in realizing its loftier thematic ambitions.|Fresh
Though it's a bit of a wobbly mess at times, Hacksaw Ridge ultimately winds up being a deeply moving character study about an unlikely American hero.|Fresh
...there just isn't enough material here to sustain the movie's overlong and occasionally oppressive 131 minutes...|Fresh
No matter how you may personally feel about Mel Gibson, he knows how to stir our emotions and make us think.|Fresh
Something, anything should've broken through as cinematic agitation in 2016, but Ridge is about as tepid as deafening, blood-soaked movies come.|Rotten
Only Mad Mel could make a film about the virtues of pacifism that's also the most insanely violent thing I've seen in the ten years since he last directed a movie.|Fresh
True story of pacifist soldier has extreme war violence.|Fresh
Garfield is absolutely mesmerizing at the heart of it all, giving a performance brimming with naivet that becomes steely determination and, finally, something more - a shining light in humanity's darkest moments.|Fresh
By the time Hacksaw Ridge reaches its necessary messianic finish, it's hard to not be moved by the boggling heroism of this dutiful man.|Fresh
While some may find satisfaction thinking of it as a visceral action film, the predominant sense it leaves is of wasted opportunity -- of how great this film could have been with a touch of nuance.|Rotten
Hacksaw Ridge gets an A+ for action and a C for just about everything else, and your interest in seeing it will depend largely on your priorities as a filmgoer.|Fresh
...an old fashioned, yet, still modern and violent approach to exposing the horrors of war while celebrating the heroism that is on display.|Fresh
Throwback war film among best, bloodiest of the year.|Fresh
Once you get to the actual war, the movie becomes respectable, serious, even thoughtful.|Fresh
It's so blatant it feels more like a parody of his own other graphically violent movies. There's an actual Evil Dead moment in a battle scene, followed by heads literally exploding.|Rotten
An effective war film, enamored by its own violence, but anchored by a terrific performance by Garfield.|Fresh
The scenes in battle are as harrowing as any ever put on screen. We are in the midst of utter carnage and chaos.|Fresh
Garfield gives an Oscar-worthy performance, showing the medic to be a simple man of conviction and courage.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge does justice to the courage and conscience of this man of nonviolence. This could have been a great film at 100 minutes or so. Too bad it runs 131.|Fresh
Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair with a brutal, confronting and uplifting true story of extraordinary heroism.|Fresh
Man, I thought most of this film was a load of hooey -- right down to Garfield's tremulous, moist-eyed performance and that sing-songy cornpoke accent of his.|Rotten
"It is a bruising war story from a filmmaker whose primitive storytelling insists on conveying as graphically as possible the hell of physical suffering in wartime caused by those supposedly ""human."""|Fresh
Even accepting that everything depicted about Doss' heroics are true, Hacksaw Ridge delivers them like someone too intent on wanting to make us feel good about ourselves for honoring the bravery and sacrifice of those soldiers.|Rotten
At times horrifying, inspiring, and heart-wrenching, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most successful war films of recent memory.|Fresh
You can't argue with war, but there's a sense of Gibson's Braveheart-styled bloodlust that frames every scene, holding a primal - stifled - yell. Throw Andrew Garfield's spongemop of a screen presence in there, and the whole thing borders on absurd...|Fresh
Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge tells a story that's worth telling. That's important to emphasize, because the way that Gibson and his collaborators tell their story isn't always worthy.|Fresh
The film could use a lot more grey and lot less in the form of jingoistic, manipulative battlemongering.|Rotten
Impassioned patriotism and religious conviction constitute the core of Hacksaw Ridge, a stirring -- and surpassingly violent -- dramatization of the life of Desmond T. Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.|Fresh
Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair with the World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge, bringing his great gifts for epic filmmaking and his problematic tendencies.|Fresh
Gibson uses tried-and-true tropes so effectively that you don't mind how hokey they actually are, and he stages the battle sequences...with such assurance that those craving violent action will be sated.|Fresh
Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with strong beliefs, one of which is the redeeming power of spectacular, voyeuristic pain and violence.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge has something in common with Loving, another real-life story opening this week... in both instances it's the strength of the underlying narrative, more than the filmmaking, which does most of the heavy lifting.|Fresh
While the early scenes have their sappy side, you can feel Gibson's artistic juices start to flow once the story gets to the battlefield.|Fresh
It's good, in a sturdy, muted, unsurprising way.|Fresh
this film is a harrowing experience, but also one that is jubilantly uplifting in its celebration of quiet courage and the strength of personal belief|Fresh
It ends up with a fairly confused message something like... pacifism is awesome, but violence is also awesome, but God is the most awesome.|Fresh
It's an exceptional picture and Gibson's finest work to date, gracefully but forcefully sharing faith-based interests without resorting to preachiness, putting Godly trust to the test on a merciless battlefield.|Fresh
The movie believes that Desmond [Doss] is sincere in his beliefs. It simply doesn't want to believe them.|Rotten
The young soldier's pacifism was so profound and so truly lived that it neutralizes the director's characteristic bloodlust.|Fresh
Faith and fighting -- two of Mel Gibson's biggest obsessions -- are at the heart of his excellent new movie, Hacksaw Ridge. It's a war movie about a pacifist.|Fresh
Gibson is a skillful puppet master in these big battle scenes, but man, does he pour on the gore.|Fresh
Garfield, in a fiercely committed performance, projects a mix of unwavering principal and emotional vulnerability.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is drenched in the blood of the fallen and the mud forever caked on the boots of those who survived to tell the tale. It's the closest thing to feeling as though you've marched a mile in those shoes.|Fresh
When your protagonist is a World War II medic during the campaign to take Okinawa, you can make a poetry of corpses (and near-corpses) without swerving from the cause of realism.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is old-fashioned moviemaking of the kind Gibson excels at: where men are men, women are women and champions rise to smite villains in gory combat.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge embraces many of the clichs of the war movie but, instead of laying them out in a rote fashion, the film synthesizes them into a visceral, ultimately inspirational result.|Fresh
An unusual pro-peace war film from director Mel Gibson. Solidly entertaining and impressively faithful to the facts.|Fresh
"""Hacksaw Ridge"" winds up being a rousing piece of entertainment that also happens to be an affecting portrait of spiritual faith and simple human decency."|Fresh
There's power in Gibson's simplicity and hardheaded certainty, and there are moments so utterly absorbing that quibbles about the lack of character nuance feel beside the point. And yet, his brand of heroism ultimately feels too one-dimensional.|Rotten
A stunning achievement... This is a movie about a gentle man, but it's not a gentle film.|Fresh
'Hacksaw Ridge' is a profile of a courageous individual who put his trust in God, showed grace under fire and never wavered from his core convictions.|Fresh
"After a lengthy absence from the Hollywood forefront, director Mel Gibson (""Braveheart,"" ""Apocalypto"") is back with a heroic and brutal war film that checks off all his recurring themes."|Fresh
There is something refreshing about a commercial film that challenges us with juxtaposition and refuses to placate its base, particularly in this gerrymandered political era.|Fresh
Can be seen as an examination of war and nonviolence, but it also begs to be seen - like Birth of a Nation, with its #BlackLivesMatter echoes - in light of contemporary issues.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge isn't a pacifist screed, but it shows Gibson's evolving views of depicting violence in his movies.|Fresh
Hacksaw never really delves into the moral grays; it's just black and white and red all over.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge isn't as great as some of Gibson's past work, but it's a well-made drama that's bolstered by a superb central performance and the best battle sequences since Saving Private Ryan.|Fresh
This film is inept and beautiful, stupid and amazing. It doesn't have the words or images to express how deep it is.|Fresh
"Fitting for a film made by someone long out of the game, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a throwback, which in this case means to a type of film that was still popular only seven or eight years ago."|Fresh
Subtlety has never been one of Gibson's strengths as a filmmaker. But this amazing story of heroism can take anything he throws at it and keep going, much like Doss himself.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is full of broad characterizations and even broader gestures. But it takes a difficult position and holds to it, even as it piles on the shredded limbs, rotting corpses, and zings of sniper fire.|Fresh
"With Andrew Garfield in the lead role and Mel Gibson in the director's chair for the first time in 10 years, ""Hacksaw"" is an incredibly powerful picture once it gets to the battle scenes."|Fresh
Gibson lays on the sentiment and the blood and guts in equal measure, and both drown out the genuine heroism of the true story.|Rotten
I respectfully, conscientiously object to the way Desmond Doss has been simplified and sanctified in the movie.|Rotten
This is a tough movie, but it's also accomplished and driven filmmaking, ultimately in the service of something good.|Fresh
It is violent, harrowing, heartbreaking and unforgettable. And yes, it was directed by Mel Gibson. He deserves a medal, too.|Fresh
A good movie, a straightforward story of faith and courage whose complications arise not in the story, but in the telling of it.|Fresh
Garfield melts into his Doss character in a performance that seems impossibly still and tranquil. He's mesmerizing.|Fresh
There are a lot of war films, but Hacksaw Ridge feels unique in its dogged pacifism.|Fresh
[Gibson's] willingness to boil characters down to archetypes gives him a naive strength as a visual storyteller.|Fresh
"Doss is asked time and time again if he's ""crazy."" But when we're on the ground, the film flips that notion on its head. Is it crazy to save lives or to take them? In ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" it's clearly war that's craziest of all."|Fresh
It's undeniably effective, a movie about the power of religious conviction that batters viewers with depictions of horrific violence and chaos.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is faithful to the story of Desmond Doss in every sense of the word.|Fresh
While [Gibson's] portrayal of Doss' heroism on the battlefield is moving and honorable, neither the tedious setup nor the ham-fisted delivery should get a free pass.|Rotten
Garfield anchors proceedings with unshowy, yet unfailingly admirable aplomb. The supporting ranks are equally strong, with Australian actors Luke Bracey, Hugo Weaving and Sam Worthington just three of the many standouts.|Fresh
Mel Gibson is such a polarizing figure that it's easy to forget or underestimate his considerable filmmaking talents.|Fresh
Doss's is a fascinating tale of bravery, but under Gibson's direction it's largely lost amid war-movie cliche and colliding ideology.|Rotten
Often beautiful, occasionally infuriating and always fascinating.|Fresh
Full of Gibson's oldest, but best obsessions - about the power of faith, the strength of selflessness, the stubbornness of courage.|Fresh
Hacksaw Ridge is a parable of how values can keep you strong in the worst of places. Mel Gibson returns to directing greatness. Andrew Garfield will be a strong contender for the Best Actor Oscar.|Fresh
Say what you will about Mad Mel Gibson, he's a driven, febrile artist, and there isn't a second in his war film Hacksaw Ridge - not even the ones that should register as clichs - that doesn't burn with his peculiar intensity.|Fresh
Vivid and visceral, it's still more impressive than inspiring.|Fresh
Gibson's inability to bring a measured approach nearly treads over Doss' deeply affecting, truly remarkable story like a Sherman tank across a muddy battlefield.|Fresh
A Rare Gift To Everyone Who Sees It|Fresh
