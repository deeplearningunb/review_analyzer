The Big Sleep is wakeful fare for folks who don't care what is going on, or why, so long as the talk is hard and the action harder.|Fresh
The Big Sleep, though, is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.|Fresh
Brittle Chandler characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.|Fresh
What you remember here are moments.|Fresh
This is arguably the high-water mark of Hollywood's love affair with the infinitely slippery possibilities of the English language.|Fresh
It's likely to leave you confused and dissatisfied.|Rotten
...seriously, does anyone care how the chauffeur died?|Fresh
To watch The Big Sleep is to witness a distinctly American film genre at the heights of its power, nonsensical plot notwithstanding.|Fresh
"""I don't like your manners."" ""I don't like them myself. They're pretty bad... I grieve over them on long winter evenings."""|Fresh
The plot's complexity and slow unravelling of its subject matter of exploitation, blackmail and murder, make it the obvious precursor to some of the great, modern noir dramas.|Fresh
The development is solid... with the almost constant presence of an ironic Humphrey Bogart, perfectly aware of his fullness as an actor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Big Sleep remains one of the greatest film noirs ever made.|Fresh
The plethora of killings now seems on the whole less horrific than it once did, while the film's tone of escalating absurdity in a genuinely dark world grows if anything even more sprightly as the years go by.|Fresh
Classic noir gem has menace, innuendo.|Fresh
The Big Sleep is the best scripted, best directed, best acted, and least comprehensible film noir ever made.|Fresh
The plot is a bundle of confusions, but who cares? Few films have made cigarettes seem so glamorous. Or had such seductive repartee.|Fresh
The Big Sleep is as fresh and perverse as ever, and remains one of Hollywood's most entrancingly strange bedtime stories.|Fresh
Hawks' film noir remains legendary, despite complicated and convoluted plot, due to its star power and chemistry between Bogart and Bacall.|Fresh
It's unmissable, irresistible.|Fresh
The Big Sleep has the distinction of being without doubt one of the greatest crime films of the Forties, yet also one of the least structurally satisfying.|Fresh
Oozing class from start to finish, Howard Hawks' 1946 noir isn't just a Hollywood classic.|Fresh
No screen couple, before or since, had as much chemistry as Bogart and Bacall.|Fresh
One of the great pleasures of the silver screen.|Fresh
Try to see the original version, which explains the plot better and has better story telling.|Fresh
If anyone ever tries to make the argument that plot is more important than anything else in cinema, this is a great movie to throw in their face.|Fresh
The direction, cinematography, screenplay, brooding score and acting in this movie are all without fault. If you see one film noir movie in your life, make it this one.|Fresh
Bogart as Marlowe is compelling in this classic thriller that is complex but triumph of atmospheric cool.|Fresh
Tribes of monkeys doing monkey things, albeit things related to the perforation of the flesh: murder and blood and sweat and sex.|Fresh
True classic Bogie and Bacall, even though plot is way out puzzling in many ways.|Fresh
One of the most intriguing, energetic and playful film noirs ever.|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
It matters not that even the writers (including William Faulkner) weren't sure who shot whom in Hawks' rousing adaptation of the Raymond Chandler detective novel.|Fresh
There's little else I can add about this proto-noir, one of the archetypes of the genre and a showstopper for Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, who spar through a catty romance while dancing through a taut mystery.|Fresh
Wide awake amid the smoke and mirrors.|Fresh
|Fresh
|Rotten
A trama extremamente complexa  uma mera desculpa para os dilogos perfeitos e para a presena sempre intensa de Bogart.|Fresh

|Fresh
The dialogue is hard-boiled and crackles with wit, the plot is fast-paced and nearly impenetrable, and Humphrey Bogart is coolly unflappable in Howard Hawkesâ€™s stylish noir classic.|Fresh
|Fresh
Good, but incredibly muddled version of the Chandler novel.|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
Bogart and Bacall are so good together that the story's impenetrability doesn't matter much, as long as it keeps serving up suspenseful situations and sassy dialogue.|Fresh
This movie was among the most fun movies I have ever seen.|Fresh
|Fresh
Don't try too hard to follow the story, just get swept away by the mood of the film.|Fresh
...fast, witty, and exciting. It may not make a lot of sense, but it's got layers of mood and ambience.|Fresh
I can't think of a crime drama with a story that can match that can match the headlong intricacy of The Big Sleep.|Fresh
Great dialogue, atmosphere and performances by Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and others.|Fresh
The Big Sleep (1946) is one of Raymond Chandler's best hard-boiled detective mysteries transformed into a film noir, private detective film classic|Fresh
One of the greatest detective films to come out of Hollywood.|Fresh
A first-rate thriller.|Fresh
For all young filmmakers, seeing the metamorphosis of a good film into a great one will be instructive.|Fresh
Fascinating if not necessarily improved edition of Howard Hawks' 1946 detective classic.|Fresh
It is typical of this most puzzling of films that no one agrees even on why it is so puzzling. Yet that has never affected The Big Sleep's enduring popularity, because the movie is about the process of a criminal investigation, not its results.|Fresh
A movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.|Fresh
