It's certainly a film worth pondering and discussing, even if its tone is unsettling. And for the record: I'd be a dolphin.|Fresh
You haven't seen anything like The Lobster before. Everything you expect from your experience of watching films and reading books and from your understanding of human emotions is turned upside down with emphatic elan.|Fresh
This is the kind of film that just by explaining the premise is a conversation starter to be used at your next dinner party|Fresh
Not a story you should question beyond the world it has created, but that doesn't matter. Because what does happen within its confines is so weird, while at the same time so obvious, that it's compellingly gripping (until it fizzles out near the end).|Fresh
The Lobster knows what it's saying and is confident in its execution.|Fresh
Like all good satire, it takes what's already obvious about the world around us and just transforms it into something new.|Fresh
This is a peculiar film which logically should not work, but somehow, through the uninhibited and confident ingenuity of the filmmakers, produces a remarkable impact.|Fresh
Yorgos Lanthimos plays it completely straight. Deadpan, awkward delivery seals the world completely unto itself, and it's pointless to wonder why or how the world came to be like this. When a film obeys its own logic so completely, the story just works.|Fresh
Despite its singular qualities and unnerving tenor, The Lobster,... fails to inspire critique beyond such surface level targets. In a world this muted and carefully subjugated, there's very little room for life's little mysteries to take root.|Rotten

"""The Lobster"" is a film that may confuse as much as it may delight."|Fresh
In terms of Lanthimos' work it's perhaps his least arresting to date, but it remains an entertaining examination of romance, loneliness and at the very least has you wondering what animal you would like to be turned into.|Fresh
Brutal and hilarious, with satire so sharp it could cut your wrists.|Fresh
Yorgos Lanthimos, who directed as well as co-wrote the script with Efthymis Filippou, wisely has chosen to really make the film hit home in a way that seems all too possible by setting it in a world virtually indistinguishable... from the one we live in.|Fresh
Yorgos Lanthimos's new film is vague and complicated, putting its international all-star cast in situations that portend great metaphoric meaning but end up comparing nosebleeds with blindness.|Rotten
The final result is a predictably off-kilter endeavor from an unapologetically avant-garde filmmaker...|Rotten
It is quite a miracle Lanthimos got this film to work. Not because of how leftfield it is, but because of the amount of international input that excels in it.|Fresh
Greek director/co-writer Yorgos Lanthimos designs a distinctive dystopian world and questions the idea of typical relationships and how couples connect at a surface level.|Fresh
The Lobster amounts to razor-sharp satire blasting away at the societal norms and constructs of relationships, but a shame that it decides to ditch its hotel setting full of intrigue|Fresh
The trouble lies in the film's noncommittal tone, which too often deviates from Lanthimos' reliable deadpan. Set against the earlier films' prickliness, The Lobster seems oddly ingratiating.|Rotten
The Lobster is well-acted and its weird internal logic scrupulously maintained, but as the second half dragged endlessly on, I found its point as elusive as its ending.|Rotten
I love it, I can't guarantee you will all love it, too, but if you're open to trying a different flavor, The Lobster is definitely worth a shot.|Fresh
While the first half is full of flavour, the second is unappetisingly bland.|Rotten
In The Lobster, the bottom-line examination of love gets dressed up and framed in curious ways.|Fresh
As the architect David, Colin Farrell gives an unexpectedly restrained, brilliantly undemonstrative performance. Supporting actors are also remarkable: Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Rachel Weisz, Olivia Colman and LÃ©a Seydoux.|Fresh
[The Lobster] captures what it feels like to be single.|Fresh
The Lobster seem funny. But that feeling fades, leaving us with a sense of fatalism but without a larger sense of actual meaning.|Rotten
I'd much rather watch a rom-com that reflects the anxieties and concerns of an app-happy, monogamy-wary landscape, even if it's bleak.|Fresh
The film is a pitch-black satire about relationships and the unrealistic expectations modern society imposes about how they should work.|Fresh
The Lobster is not perfect film and there are some holes in the narrative, but then again, it doesn't really matter because its heart is intact, and there are so many rich details that one can examine the film through multiple lenses.|Fresh
The Lobster is very much its own thing. And what a peculiar, exhilarating thing it is.|Fresh
The Lobster frightens and entertains, saddens and inspirits us-in this case with a final vision of self-sacrifice and devotion that ultimately transcends society's attempts to commodify and regulate the mystery of love.|Fresh
Not just Colin Farrell's best performance, but a film that reminds us what a contrivance marriage and relationships can be when mandated by societal pressures.|Fresh
A movie that explores the full spectrum of relationships with impeccable wit, delightfully dark humor and insights so sharp they verge on deadly.|Fresh
The Lobster is the kind of movie that can cure anybody going through a period of messy emotional distress, due to how sharply it satirises the ritualistic natures of relationships and single-life, taking its parody to levels of science-fiction extremity.|Fresh
The Lobster just loses its charm at a certain point, and nothing interesting or exciting happens with the characters.|Rotten
This movie is like science fiction, except that in it, human nature is altered in some fundamental ways. If you are a romantic like me, you might find this painful to watch, but cynics might love it. I really hated this movie.|Rotten
You can see what The Lobster is trying to say so clearly that there's never that refreshing possibility of misunderstanding or ambiguity, essential for a real work of genius.|Rotten
The unabashed strangeness of the whole affair will mean only some audiences need apply. For me, this is easily the most original movie of the year, and it's also one of the best.|Fresh
The Lobster is not for everybody. But if you're adventurous and patient, there are ample rewards to be had.|Fresh
Alas, the movie loses its assurance in the over-extended second half.|Rotten
Part of the joy of Lanthimos's film is seeing in it any degree of subtext you like.|Fresh
Among the recent crop of dystopias, The Lobster is quite possibly unique -- an actors' workshop exercise that relies almost entirely on dialogue and situations instead of kinetic displays of heroism.|Fresh
Like [Lanthimos's] other films, The Lobster invents a world all its own.|Fresh
A movie so unpredictable that you really can't be sure where it's heading.|Fresh
Lanthimos wrings emotion out of human interaction in ways that are both bizarre and funny.|Fresh
A delightfully bleak satire set in a dystopian present.|Fresh
Farrell and Weisz spark off of one another, delivering a convincing and rather touching on-screen partnership.|Fresh
Hardly less kind in its satiric attack on the basic emotional pillars of human existence than Lanthimos's last two films, but it adds a veneer of magical realism.|Fresh
The Lobster wonderfully kick-starts a new year in movies with its breathtaking cinematography, performances, score, and storyline. Although it has a male lead, the film's story is driven by women.|Fresh
Lanthimos makes brutal, incisive points to make about the absurdity of coupling in the first place, much less society's view of what makes a perfect couple.|Fresh
The experience of inhabiting this otherworld even for two hours is so harrowing and demanding that The Lobster doesn't easily relinquish its viewers, especially as its ambiguous ending offers no clean takeaway.|Fresh
Lanthimos is obviously after bigger game than a black relationship comedy, every detail (even the most horrifying) in the movie contributes to what is becoming Lanthimos' signature tone of heartbreaking hilarity.|Fresh
"""The Lobster"" peters out about halfway through but regardless, director Lanthimos and co-writer Filippou have constructed a singular and ambitious vision, rich with symbolism and observant commentary about societal pressures to pair up."|Fresh
Lanthimos invests his absurdist parable with a dark, deadpan humor and an eerie poetry....|Fresh
This is the type of film I'm going to watch multiple times, obsessing over every choice Lanthimos and his talented team of cinematic craftsmen made in order to see it come to life.|Fresh
The Lobster is brilliant, but it's bleak.|Fresh
A brutal critique of the hell human relationships can be. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos may have positioned himself among the world's great, provocative ""maverick"" filmmakers with this bizarre yet fascinating dystopian nightmare for grown-ups."|Fresh
The social pressure to be part of a couple is taken to Kafkaesque extremes in this poker-faced absurdist critique of the idea -- typically expressed most enthusiastically in commercial motion pictures -- that a successful, happy life requires a mate.|Fresh
I just had no appetite for something I found under-cooked and unappealing.|Rotten
... creates a fascinating world of repression and isolation, and tackles it with a deadpan sense of humor.|Fresh
This one-of-a-kind film might just be the perfect date movie for people who hate dating.|Fresh
The film is sort of allegorical, sort of science fiction, sort of philosophical, definitely original, definitely unpredictable and most definitely weird.|Fresh
There is so much more, but part of the (perverse) pleasure of The Lobster is how it keeps you off guard, never lets you feel settled.|Fresh
A brilliant and methodical consideration of strange cultural standards as they are practiced to the desensitizing peak of lunacy.|Fresh
Hunger Games. Maze Runner. Divergent. This is how a dystopian movie ought to be made.|Fresh
Its characters are merely single defining characteristics rather than real people; they have nothing, and hence nothing to lose. And as for wit -- without that, satire is just meanness.|Rotten
Claws down, The Lobster is the weirdest movie I've seen this year.|Fresh
the viewer is never allowed to feel he/she really understands what is going on. Strange ideas just keep being added to the mix.|Fresh
It's a doozy of a satirical premise concocted by Yorgos Lanthimos, who directs and co-wrote the screenplay, that evokes the fundamental absurdity of the very real social pressure to find a mate and proceed along a pre-determined path of existence.|Fresh
The wildest love story in many a moon.|Fresh
Farrell and Weisz balance the off-kilter dystopia with vibrant, sexual heat.|Fresh
Lately, it seems to always come back to John Malkovich.|Fresh
Lanthimos and his co-writer, Efthymis Filippou, neatly satirize the societal pressures of mating and the difficulties of finding a soulmate, but the movie runs out of ideas long before it runs out of story.|Rotten
It is a puzzler that rewards. Fans of Kafka will embrace it. The Lobster also has a little of George Orwell's 1984 and, maybe, behind all the pretense, a hint of good sense. But you've got to work to get to the good sense.|Fresh
It raises more questions than it answers during its fairly tedious and ultimately rather pointless two-hour run.|Rotten
It's remorseless and pure and unlike anything you've ever seen before, and it's now playing near you if you're adventurous enough to take the plunge.|Fresh
It's a movie that latches on to your entertainment soul with a complexity that can't be dislodged, for better or worse.|Fresh
Memorability is something. Maybe it's even a recommendation.|Fresh
I have an appreciation for absurdist fare, but The Lobster is an overcooked comedy that loses steam about halfway through the experience.|Rotten
"I was caught up almost immediately in ""The Lobster,"" a movie as prickly and difficult to approach as the title character."|Fresh
Director Yorgos Lanthimos challenges society's demands that we mate - for life.|Fresh
It is weird, but it is also meaningful, emotional and unexpectedly hilarious. Best of all, it's a strikingly original film, a precious thing in homogenous Hollywood.|Fresh
It's a satire that's actually biting, and satirical of something not typically satirized. (Splice Today)|Fresh
Strange and surreal, an audacious, absurdist satire - it's the most bizarre film I've seen!|Fresh
What animal would director Lanthimos pick to be changed into? Would it be The Skunk?|Rotten
The Lobster is being marketed as a comedy, and it is frequently funny, but only in the way A Clockwork Orange is frequently funny. Go and have a laugh, for sure, but don't be shocked when the claws come out.|Fresh
There is much about this film that I love, and yet I can't embrace it fully. But I adore how Lanthimos creates a kind of ominous oppressiveness combined with a goofy absurdism.|Fresh
"""The Lobster"" is a wild, fun, occasionally mean-spirited satire of the rituals and humiliations of modern dating. But it asks uncomfortable questions of us. It's the best movie I've seen so far this year."|Fresh
A darkly absurdist comedy with a surprising strain of tenderness beneath its edgy surface.|Fresh
The sort of movie that makes you consider what the filmmaker is saying, as well as what the movie is actually about.|Fresh
Lanthimos's unsettling tour de force reminds us of how chained to coupledom dignity remains at both the private and public level.|Fresh
'The Lobster' is a different species of movie; one that takes great pains to create a world you may be hesitant to visit - but one you will definitely be happy to leave.|Fresh
Interesting concept, but this vision of the future mostly involves Farrell, John C. Reilly, Rachel Weisz and the rest of cast lurching through their lines in a dull, passionless monotone.|Rotten
The Lobster is what would happen if Wes Anderson set about doing Franz Kafka, with a hefty dash of George Orwell thrown into the mix: surreal, comic, sad, strange, beautiful, sublime.|Fresh
Investigates the nature of our need for a partner (who else will apply that pain-relief cream to the small of your back?), how we cling to superficial similarities to justify our matches, and our denial, at our peril, of our animal nature.|Fresh
The best romantic satire since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.|Fresh
If we've come to idolize marriage in contemporary Western society, The Lobster has come to desecrate it.|Fresh
Humor in the Craziness of the Situations|Fresh
It's a murky soup of commentary and ideas about modern love and loneliness presented in the most unsettling and imaginative way.|Fresh
By the 60-minute mark Lathimos' bag of tricks is empty, kickstarting a long slide into tedium that sinks a project that should have sung.|Rotten
Farrell absolutely kills it as David. Weisz gives one of her best performances since her Oscar-winning turn in The Constant Gardener.|Fresh
[Lanthimos'] commitment to his high-concept tragicomedies is extraordinary.|Fresh
Loneliness is all-encompassing and human desperation can be disturbing: We've seen these ideas before. It just so happens that The Lobster lets them play out in the weirdest cinematic thought experiment imaginable.|Fresh
This is proof that you can be uniquely offbeat and utterly boring and nonsensical, too.|Rotten
Farrell makes a convincing sad sack regaining his romantic pulse. Weisz is radiant as, depending on how you see her character, a triumphant or a tragic heroine. Take a chance and go with this one.|Fresh
[A]n anti-romance that presents two, extreme ways of living as a means of dissecting the concept of love, tossing its organs on the floor, and then stomping on the carcass.|Fresh
The Lobster is an incredibly weird movie, but its heart is totally on its sleeve and in the right place.|Fresh
Lanthimos works the premise assiduously, especially after the Farrell character escapes and joins a band of rebel singles in the woods, and though the story slows to a crawl near the end, the poker-faced dramatization of a warped world is compelling.|Fresh
It takes a touch of audacity and madness to make a film like this, a screwball, absurdist tragedy that might be a little too long and contrived for some viewers' taste.|Fresh
Lanthimos and Filippou keep the audience guessing about their ultimate ends right up to the final shot, and beyond.|Fresh
The movie is worthwhile, thanks to a marriage of peculiar humor and thought-provoking content.|Fresh
"Everyone's excellent in ""The Lobster,"" and the suffocatingly bland settings brake just short of monumental claustrophobia."|Fresh
"People say this kind of thing all the time - I'm pretty sure I have a time or two - but ""The Lobster"" is unlike any movie you've ever seen."|Fresh
The Lobster packs a wicked punch, eviscerating modern romance in surprising and evocative ways.|Fresh
While it starts out as a sharp satire on the horrors of dating, The Lobster stretches so far into absurdity that its various eccentricities overshadow the point it's trying to make.|Rotten
Whatever its merits or intellectual pretensions, I am looking forward to never seeing it again.|Rotten
"If you can live with its blemishes, ""The Lobster"" is a bracing experience."|Fresh
"Perhaps nearly two hours of this world is more than necessary, but the themes and emotions presented in ""The Lobster"" are deeply felt, even when articulated by blank faces."|Fresh
An uproarious yet deadpan satire concerning societal constructs, dating mores and power structures that also manages to be a surprisingly moving, gloriously weird love story.|Fresh
Weird, confounding, amusing but perplexing - those are all words which spring to mind when trying to describe The Lobster.|Fresh
[A] seriously funny horror-comedy.|Fresh
Deadpan allegory without a single straight answer... Lanthimos remains one of world cinema's prime proponents of The Weird... The moments of tenderness and weirdness are the movie's highest, most BuÃ±uelesque highs.|Fresh
The Lobster's delightfully original, disturbing and peculiar opening hour just about makes up for the fact that its second half is disappointingly dull.|Fresh
The Lobster is a divinely weird satire of romantic conformity from Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos. It's a recipe that's as weird as it is tragic, as philosophically sabre sharp as it is hilarious; this is a film that deserves your time.|Fresh
...it plays cleverly with the compatibility assumptions behind, say, singles groups and online dating sites.|Fresh
Its tone of deadpan absurdism never really develops into anything truly subversive or visionary. It's a weirdo, sub-J.G. Ballard conceit: J.G. Ballard for Dummies.|Fresh
"director Yorgos Lanthimos made an art house splash in 2010 with his black comedy ""Dogtooth."" While his latest is still dark in its outlook, it's also more laugh-out-loud funny, it's witty absurdism complemented by its deadpan acting."|Fresh
A wild, sad, mordantly funny dystopia that gives sexual desperation the bad name it deserves.|Fresh
Lanthimos takes our intrinsic desire for companionship, filters it through a funhouse mirror, and reflects it back to us brilliantly.|Fresh
This festival favorite becomes a sometimes scary, if darkly humorous take on the future (maybe) in the hands of absurdist director Yorgos Lanthimos.|Fresh
Yorgos Lanthimos has made a film that's disturbingly hilarious, and perhaps even surpasses the benchmarks for discomfort he set with 2010's Oscar-nominated Dogtooth.|Fresh
While extremely funny, it is a bitter and ruthless film. Lanthimos plays target practice and his aim is deadly.|Fresh
This is not a movie like too many others. Or any, in fact.|Fresh
"""The Lobster"" is very much its own brand of horror movie, as well as a deranged thought experiment, a stealth love story, and a witty dismantling of the usual barriers separating man from beast."|Fresh
"A boldly imaginative Kafka-esque parable, ""The Lobster"" is loaded with dazzling ideas that don't ultimately pull together."|Fresh
Lanthimos's terrifically twisted satire takes us places most films fear to tread. The symbolism is humanized by a top-flight cast and an ending that manages to be brutal and rapturously romantic at the same time.|Fresh
In its own, surreal way, it says something about modern society. Who hasn't felt pressured by parents to pair off? Or by single friends to stay unattached?|Fresh
The Lobster is a droll piece of work lashed with grim humor. For every moment that makes you laugh, there may be another that leaves you with your mouth hanging open.|Fresh
It's life viewed at its most pessimistic, not just to get us down but to force us, like the best absurdist works, to reexamine what we take for granted.|Fresh
The existential rabbit-hole plot of The Lobster couldn't be more bonkers. The premise shouldn't work at all, but it does...and beautifully.|Fresh
Almost before you know it, The Lobster has morphed into a parable about sacrifice in the name of love-all without dialing back the brutal absurdism one bit.|Fresh
This movie is crazypants, but, man, it is my kind of crazy.|Fresh
Mr. Farrell, a habitual over-actor, is especially affecting because you can sense his effort to restrain himself. Rachel Weisz ... is perfectly cast as the only person in this world with the normal capacities for warmth, empathy and desire.|Fresh
All of this could only have come from the warped imagination of Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, here making his singularly strange English-language debut.|Fresh
A cynical sci-fi comedy about life's most clichÃ©d script: pair off or perish. That's been the formula since the first primeval fish, and every living thing since has been a sequel.|Fresh
[The film] grandiosely aims to be a dark comedy reflection of our rigid world, but it is so dark that nothing can be truly gleaned beyond its own satisfied cleverness.|Rotten
[CANNES 2015] This lobster is a dog.|Rotten
The Lobster is Lanthimos's first English-language film - Kinetta, Dogtooth, and Alps were all in his native Greek - but no aspect of his sensibility has been lost in translation.|Fresh
"Imaginatively designed but also intellectually bracing, ""The Lobster"" boasts a nervous unease that pulses throughout the film, lending the story an endless tension and unpredictability. We never have any idea where Lanthimos is going next."|Fresh
Darkly funny, it's a perfect example of world-building. ... Set in a dystopian near future, it's the ultimate Bridget Jones nightmare: singletons are being singled out.|Fresh
The English-language debut of Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos is built on a terrific premise, but some cracks appear in the foundation by the final act.|Fresh
A sad, warm and genuinely touching story about... how hard it is to form a deep relationship in a society that values artificiality.|Fresh
"""The Lobster"" is more than a satire on the dating game. It digs deeper, needling at the status of our most tender emotions."|Fresh
The picture's surrealism requires an attentive and particular audience which will find rewards therein.|Fresh
A film that doesn't take itself too seriously but it has a lot of great moments thanks to its highly stylish tone. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This viewer appreciated 'The Lobster''s willingness to take this premise all the way, without pulling any punches.|Fresh
Lanthimos' films are so laced with cruelty and despair that it can be easy to forget how fascinating and funny they are.|Fresh
Even though The Lobster is full of dark humor, you won't see the characters winking at the viewer. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Clever and transgressive, sophisticated and intriguing, the film is a brilliant reflection on what society expects of individuals as members of a couple and the stupidity of dogmatism. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Like every great film it's perfectly written and it doesn't adhere itself to the conventions of the genre rising above the plot and development. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Colin Farrell is formidable in this film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Lobster, like the crustacean itself, is delivered in segments.|Rotten
An original film, outstanding, a success. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Lobster is a brilliant piece of satire, but largely fails in an attempt to build its wicked wit into a more conventional romance.|Fresh
For this viewer the whole thing ran out of steam halfway through. A general flat affect, mirrored in visuals and performance, eventually stopped being funny.|Rotten
Bone-dry dystopian satire, with Lanthimos piling absurdity upon absurdity, results in a film that is by turns entertaining and baffling, but also fully in command of its crazy world.|Fresh
Pitched somewhere between Luis Bunuel and Larry David, Lanthimos combines small behavioural comedy and twisted surrealism with darkly cynical edge.|Fresh
In this half-mythical, half-surrealistic portrait of an innocent Everyman's confrontation with a cold-blooded system, Lanthimos achieves a level of audience identification that his previous films had failed to bring about.|Fresh
A film worthy of being seen (again and again) for tenderize and view with concern the way that our relations have been taking over the years. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A narrative shapeshifter that gleefully toys with its audience's perception of love and themselves.|Fresh
In the end, The Lobster is one of the most bizarre (and therefore original) love stories ever told in cinema, exploring deep into human psyche. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Lobster is a refreshingly outstanding film in its simultaneous originality and familiarity.|Fresh
Lanthimos again exhibits his aptitude for creating insular, ruthlessly regimented microcosms through which to unleash his scathing satire.|Fresh
The gag may ultimately wear thin, but it's a hoot while it lasts.|Fresh
To call the film weird would be an understatement, but it's the strange, surreal world and the little details that make it even stranger that are the film's best asset.|Fresh
In a way, you could say THE LOBSTER is like a Woody Allen film if Woody did huge amounts of hallucinogenic drugs all through the scripting phase and principal photography.|Fresh
Lanthimos trumps the outlandish premise and turns the film into accessible and timeless reverie. It's a spark of ingenuity that doesn't rely on subversions or meta humor. Just originality.|Fresh
Though many elements are undeniably comedic, The Lobster belongs first and foremost to the horror genre; a fact all the more impressive considering it never seeks to deliberately scare its audience|Fresh
All so weird, intriguing and occasionally amusing. Unfortunately, director Yorgos Lanthimos tries to claw out too many ideas leading The Lobster to drift and go off the boil.|Rotten
An rare movie that some will enjoy with passion, but general audiences might find it too weird. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Easily one of the films of the year.|Fresh
As expected with Lanthimos, The Lobster is utterly bizarre... it's the director's first film in English, yet also his first to show shades of human side, even as it concludes that we humans are an exceptionally silly and sad little species.|Fresh
[Lanthimos] takes his sweet time in unveiling the full breadth of his film's alternate reality and its governing laws, and the world we are introduced to looks very much like our own in the present day.|Fresh
Throwing a solid Hollywood cast into a surreal arthouse satire, acclaimed Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth) makes his English-language debut with a bang.|Fresh
When it chooses to be -- which, thankfully, is often -- the film is so funny as to induce tears. Then, on a dime, it's appallingly sad again.|Fresh
It's all pretty deadpan and frequently very funny - punctuated, as is Lanthimos' wont, with brutal violence towards animals|Fresh
The central issue is the inevitable paradox where you can't meet someone when you're lonely, which is when you most want to meet someone.|Fresh
The dry wit and pervasively odd sensibility of The Lobster make it very worth cozying up to.|Fresh
A movie that seems kind and inoffensive... but that will destroy and change your life. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In this movie, Lanthimos shows himself as a seasoned director. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ultimately, The Lobster is fascinating, funny, but a little under-cooked.|Fresh
An overlong mess.|Rotten
The Lobster easily gets you involved in it's own universe to tell a story about forbiden love and a man's struggle to overcome the obstacles he has to face because of it - all of this accompanied by slow and dry humor- . [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A very well executed scary comedy, supported by cold performances and lead by a splendid Colin Farell. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A very peculiar love story about love, jealousy and control, sacrifice and selfishness, where there's little room for a positive side of anything. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's a wealth of bleak comedy in all of this but, having carefully laid out his thesis, Lanthimos doesn't know where to take it or what he really thinks about it.|Fresh
[Lanthimos'] vision remains intact, his humour as dry and at times unfathomable as ever. He is a true original.|Fresh
It's certainly one of most original films of the year, although not one of the most consistent... Lanthimos and his co-writer Efthymis Filippouâ give us a fascinating set of questions, but they do not feel the need to answer them.|Fresh
For all the absurdity at play, the genius of The Lobster is its depiction of a society and world view that's unsettlingly not all that unfamiliar.|Fresh
The Lobster is a bit of everything. At times it's hilarious, especially in its first half-hour or so, sometimes it's deeply disturbing and occasionally thought-provoking.|Fresh
Lanthimos is an acquired taste ... This is an accessible, fun and occasionally frustrating entry into his body of work.|Fresh
A brilliantly funny horror film about dating.|Fresh
It all gets a bit lost in the woods, but there's enough finely honed madness in the corridors of the hotel to cover the price of a room.|Fresh
The sheer verve of the filmmakers earned them the Jury Prize at Cannes, where unique and risky filmmaking is rewarded ahead of commercially satisfying fare|Fresh
Yorgos Lanthimos's black comedy is entirely strange and a head-scratcher but its core message is certainly relatable to a large demographic.|Fresh
The Lobster is a European arthouse film par excellence - precisely the kind of project you can't imagine ever being made in Hollywood.|Fresh
It may seem like ludicrous nonsense on the surface, but what it has to say about love, fidelity and dependency is more revealing than anything Farrell wears under his kecks.|Fresh
Superficially sharp but easily overcooked and with not quite enough meat to be entirely satisfying.|Rotten
A film set in an alternate reality must take time to establish the rules of its particular fiction, and most of the joys of The Lobster arise from these early scenes.|Fresh
Freaky-deakies need love too.|Fresh
Appreciation for the sheer conceptual confidence of the film gathers momentum once you think back over it.|Fresh
Inordinately strange and tiresomely glum, but in spots hideously funny.|Fresh
This is cinema in quotemarks, tongue-in-cheek storytelling that uses absurdity to hold a mirror to how we live and love.|Fresh
Seu senso de humor absurdo constantemente surpreende o pÃºblico.|Fresh
Lanthimos' ability to combine arch humour and outbursts of shocking violence is as potent as ever.|Fresh
Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster is maybe the most romantic movie of the year. Or maybe it's the most depressing. Or perhaps it's the most funny. Actually, it's all of those things.|Fresh
Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster is maybe the most romantic movie of the year.|Fresh
"It took some time to digest but ""The Lobster"" feels full of life and is a soulful opus on love. Quirky and clever, its black comic tones shouldn't distract from its core narrative and mission; to engage the parimeters and infatuation of devotion."|Fresh
The near-surgical precision with which Yorgos Lanthimos approaches the most surreal of conceits turns out to be a double-edged sword.|Rotten
It's an idea with delicious social parallels ripe to be explored and, for the first half at least, that's exactly what you get.|Fresh
Lanthimos presents a fully formed original vision that hits a perfect tone even when the narrative begins to get away from him a bit.|Fresh
Richly rewarding but often very disturbing.|Fresh
Acclaimed Greek auteur Lanthimos's English language debut is a smart, funny and disturbing allegory about the absurdity of rigid societal norms.|Fresh
A poisonously effective work from an utterly singular director. You walk out feeling ever so slightly changed by it. There are few higher compliments.|Fresh
A biting and idiosyncratic combination of romance, comedy, and body horror, The Lobster is one wonderful, oddball chimera of a movie.|Fresh
Savagely funny and ultimately tragic.|Fresh
Lanthimos has a gift for making imagined social conventions plausible and even logical, and in doing so he exposes -- in often brutal, mordantly funny fashion -- the arbitrariness of our own.|Fresh
Beyond the cruel deadpan humour and icy, muted visuals is a thoughtful romantic tale set in a world where people are forbidden from marching to the beat of their own drum. The Lobster is a defiantly oddball take on the classic dystopian-future narrative.|Fresh
