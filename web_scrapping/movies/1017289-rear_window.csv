Hitchcock masterpiece stars peeping Jimmy Stewart.|Fresh

Rear Window, in which Jeff watches the silent picture of his neighbours across the street, is a filmmaker's ideal movie.|Fresh
Not only is Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window one of his best pictures, it's one of the best films ever made altogether.|Fresh
One of Hitchcock's most accessible films is also one of his most gleefully deviant, dealing as it does with such fun urban pastimes as voyeurism and spousal mayhem.|Fresh
But there's no denying this is Hitchcock at his finest, and that Rear Window is worth seeing again - and again|Fresh
Voyeurism at its finest!|Fresh

The most provocative meditation on moviegoing ever made.|Fresh
Hitchcock combines technical and artistic skills in a manner that makes this an unusually good piece of murder mystery entertainment.|Fresh
voyeuristic mystery is a masterpiece of meticulous detail.|Fresh
Although it's an intensely intimate film, there's something special about taking your seat in the theater as though you're pulling up right next to L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart).|Fresh

An intriguing, brilliant Hitchcockian macabre visual study of obsessive human curiosity and voyeurism.|Fresh

Witty, suspenseful, sad, funny and wise.|Fresh
A cinematic treasure!|Fresh
A brilliant idea for a movie.|Fresh
Since the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic is all about the voyeuristic instinct, the better the view, the more sensational the experience.|Fresh
But if eggheads have made it a subject of scholarship, it's because Hitchcock and his screenwriter, John Michael Woolrich, really did create a lasting multimedia prophecy.|Fresh
Belatedly, I'm nominating a film from 1954 as the best picture of 2000.|Fresh
Its appeal, which goes beyond that of other, equally masterly Hitchcock works, remains undiminished.|Fresh
What a treat it is to see this wonderful classic from Hitchcock restored so we can enjoy it on the big screen.|Fresh
