At once a blast from the past and thoroughly modern moviemaking.|Fresh
Frantz deftly escapes the traps of its own limited premise by creating a mirror version of itself, like many of its own characters do.|Fresh
It's a visual game that strengthens Ozon's ideas, even if it makes them a little obvious. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of the simplest and most admirably beautiful tapes to be seen this year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With Frantz, [Francois] Ozon has gifted us with the kind of thoughtful, lyrical moviemaking we don't see enough of anymore.|Fresh
"Above all, however, ""Frantz"" attests to Ozon's absolute mastery over his artistic means. When I exited the theater a friend said to me, ""Nice work, right?"" Yes, absolutely."|Fresh
. . .above all Frantz is a film about reclaiming life.|Fresh
[Director François] Ozon uses Frantz to investigate the nature of forgiveness following a war-though they shared a border, Germany and France were on opposite sides of the conflict-and the weight of grief.|Fresh
They've taken us deep into the lives of characters who live in the past, but whose emotions still feel painfully alive.|Fresh
A splendid cast work through the complications and stages of grief to provide a scathingly anti-nationalist warning from history.|Fresh
It's one of the most beguilingly beautiful and heart-tugging films of the year so far.|Fresh
The plot itself is interesting, but what makes it even more so is that it pivots on the idea that human beings have the power to accept facts and interpret truth.|Fresh
Ozon has achieved emotional depths that are rather new for him.|Fresh
While not quite the masterpiece that it intends to be, Frantz still stands as one of the most touching romances this year so far.|Fresh
As the film takes on the tone of a Hitchcockian detective story, the micro and macro themes converge compellingly.|Fresh
Ozon's latest is a twisty-turny post-War mystery - think 'A Very Long Bereavement' - that boasts a kaleidoscope of quiet emotions. It unfolds slowly, but rewards patience with strong performances and a swooning third act.|Fresh
There's a pleasing symmetry to this story - lie is matched by lie, journey by journey - and Beer's silky self-possession is utterly beguiling.|Fresh
François Ozon's film is inspired by the 1932 picture Broken Lullaby, and, though the ever-inventive director has taken the plot in a new direction the movie's appeal is essentially that of an old-fashioned melodrama.|Fresh
François Ozon is a master at taking apart the French chattering classes, but here he attempts an almost classical piece of film-making in black and white, French and German, a tangled tale of love and friendship.|Fresh
François Ozon crafts a sombre monochrome melodrama, which adopts its female protagonist's perspective and skilfully plays with viewers' expectations.|Fresh
The film has valid things to say about war, national enmities and the nature of forgiveness.|Fresh
Frantz is the work of a rascal, but a rascal in an unusually reflective frame of mind. Even with its mysteries solved, you can't help but keep turning it over.|Fresh
A much needed but underwhelming ode to pacifism and the futility of war.|Fresh
Essentially, the film is concerned with a deeper mystery: how to deal with the aftermath of a grief like Anna's; and director Ozon tackles this concern with subtlety, intelligence and affecting sensitivity.|Fresh
While at times heavy-handed, the film nevertheless casts a spell with its controlled and affecting performances, and a Hitchcockian sense of romanticism and ambiguity; even the score recalls Vertigo.|Fresh
Mostly filmed in black and white and featuring a striking performance from Beer, Frantz explores personal tragedies within the wider story of a Europe broken by conflict.|Fresh
A fascinating exploration of the complexities of war from the perspective of those left behind, one given an expressionistic flourish ...|Fresh
By the end of Frantz we feel we're still waiting for this aching, reticent, glacial drama to begin.|Rotten
With all the complicated emotions involved, it's easy to see why Ozon uses color sparingly.|Fresh
It's one of his most heartfelt films, beautifully made and very moving in its own quiet, self-effacing way.|Fresh
Where previous offerings such as In the House and The New Girlfriend thrived in their light and witty tendencies, Frantz represents a far more solemn, dramatic affair, highlighting the director's noteworthy range.|Fresh
Inspired by Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film Broken Lullaby, it sensitively explores personal tragedies that reflect the bigger picture of a shattered Europe.|Fresh
A touching meditation on grief.|Fresh
More expressive than the impeccable production and costume design are Niney's sharp Daumieresque features, which seem sculpted to cut through tides of warmongering nationalistic cant like a shark's fin through the surf.|Fresh
The acting is good across the board, with Ernst Stötzner a gruff presence as Frantz's father, Marie Gruber a far more gracious but no less heartbroken mother. Niney has sharp facial feature that give him a naturally screen-classic air.|Fresh
Even after the stately action shifts to Paris, everyone's feelings are so cautiously deliberated, it's hard to get excited about their remaining options, romantic or otherwise. This is a movie to admire, not love.|Rotten
It's Beer, a breakout star at 21, who gives a breathtaking performance as a young woman slowly realizing she can live the life that war had seemingly taken from her.|Fresh
François Ozon's film works while it follows the rules of the game. As soon as it gets off it falls noticeably. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With its subtle, artistic execution and poignant story, Frantz becomes a thoughtful reflection on the pain of war and the nature of forgiveness, even in the most extreme of circumstances. It's also a tragic reminder of how love can transcend deep wounds.|Fresh
Frantz is one of Ozon's best films and also one of his most touching.|Fresh
Ozon frames this story as a romance, but that is the filmmaker doing his own act of deception.|Fresh
Featuring perfectly moving performances by an unfamiliar cast and tricks of light and colour that never feel gimmicky, this is one of the best films of the year so far.|Fresh
Frantz is suited for the moment. Not perfect, by a long shot, but right for the times.|Fresh
Through the story of Adrian and Anna's grief and shared passion, Ozon discovers means to greater, more universal, gay empathy.|Fresh
A film whose ostensibly placid surface opens to reveal powerful undercurrents of pain, hopefulness and moral uncertainty.|Fresh
Both the story and the visuals have the air of having been conjured into existence in precise strokes, each more exacting than the last.|Fresh
Interjections of color--and the narrative implications of them--are but one way in which Ozon creates and subverts expectations...Ozon remains interested in the stories people tell to one another, the horrible truths and the comfortable lies.|Fresh
There's a sense of quiet introspection reminiscent of Ozon's collaborations with Charlotte Rampling, The Swimming Pool and Under the Sand -- arguably his best films.|Fresh
One of the best French films of the past year, Frantz is a gently haunting drama about the immovable permanence and shifting potency of personal loss.|Fresh
This is no war movie. This is no romance. It's something in between... as always seems to be the case with one of cinema's most eclectic stylists and idiosyncratic voices.|Fresh
[An] involving story of love and loss.|Fresh
By the time it comes to an end, Frantz has made a permanent imprint, the hope for a better tomorrow after a cataclysmic yesterday striking chords of promise that make even the harshest of injuries feel as if they someday can be healed.|Fresh
This remains a lovely story about acceptance and understanding, themes that never get old.|Fresh
All the while, solemn though he is here, the director has fun with it. And that is what ultimately makes Frantz, despite its slow pace and occasional lulls, a pleasure to watch.|Fresh
"French filmmaker Francois Ozon reminds us of the adage, ""the first casualty of war is truth."" He does so in a way that beguiles but also bedevils."|Fresh
It takes a brave, even foolhardy, director to attempt a remake of anything made first by a master director of the order of Ernst Lubitsch, but that's precisely what Ozon has done with this beautiful melodrama.|Fresh
Using this moment in history, Ozon has made a quietly powerful film whose ultimate message is one of rebirth. The final shot will leave you breathless.|Fresh
"""Frantz"" contains revelations unrelated to the manner in which it protects, and then peels away, its central mystery. Ultimately, it addresses the question: Why go on living when life itself betrays us?"|Fresh
Celebrates its story's sense of the past with formal construction [and] gentle pacing ... often very striking ... It feels, to a degree, like an exercise in style, made more to satisfy an urge of Ozon's own rather than that of any contemporary audience.|Fresh
Though not as daring as many of his previous films, Frantz it is extremely beautiful and, typical of [Ozon's] filmography, shows uncommon empathy for its lead female character.|Fresh
a captivating piece of work|Fresh
Ozon's best effort. Spellbinding and deliriously romantic and also frankly morbid. A rare blend perfectly suited to post WWI era. Ninney and Beer are superb. Enchanting visuals.|Fresh
The late section of the film taking place in Paris and the small town of Saulieu found me in despair. Such a promising film stumbles as its characters misfire in unexpected ways. But, then again, Ozon likes to do that. Play with your expectations.|Fresh
"It's purely happenstance that Francois Ozon's ""Frantz"" is so timely in this era of Steve Bannon's America. But if the film fits, see it. And then decide if nationalism is all it's cut out to be."|Fresh
"""Frantz"" is pleasurable slow going, developing its themes at an amble but with a measure of suspense, sympathy toward its characters, and a lasting faith in filmmaking craft."|Fresh
"""Frantz"" is an old-fashioned movie, in the very best of ways."|Fresh
Frantz plays at times like a parody of an arthouse movie.|Rotten
Frantz elevates a relatively conventional surface story with an understated but powerful sense of psychological terror.|Fresh
In the central role, Beer affirms her status as a rising international star. Niney portrays hauntedness superbly.|Fresh
One could easily imagine this film being rendered in a high romantic style, but Ozon's austerity gives the story an almost classical rigor. The drama plays out in measured syncopation, with no scene or moment held too long.|Fresh
François Ozon's Frantz is a very modern period piece -- and a beautiful one -- with a fascinating lineage.|Fresh
[Ozon] seems to enjoy playing with the color and the timeline without having to be strictly beholden to reality. And that's not a bad thing.|Fresh
"More than once, ""Frantz"" hints that it will reveal itself as a homoerotic reworking of ""Broken Lullaby."" But Ozon has something simpler and no less intriguing up his sleeve."|Fresh
Ozon creates a beautiful stillness in Frantz that makes us feel we are there in the midst of these lives, witnessing the purity of their sadness.|Fresh
To deal with overwhelming grief-and guilt...elegiac in mostly black-and-white, the film has surprising resonance today, in a time of constant wars and rising nationalism.|Fresh
Like the best films, Frantz satisfies while it surprises.|Fresh
It all falls apart in the end, as Francois Ozon films sometimes do, but as usual the middle section is tops.|Fresh
Francois Ozon's post-WW1 period piece about a German widow and a French solder takes on xenophobic hatred that's as timely as Trump, making Frantz is a film of its time ... and ours.|Fresh
Few other directors have the ability to depict the psychosexual permutations of our fellow man better, at times accompanied with an unexpected Hitchcockian twist or a good dose of Almodóvarian tongue-in-cheek perversity.|Fresh
An absolutely fantastic film from Ozon ... easily Ozon's most striking and solid films in years.|Fresh
A young woman's emergence is a recurrent Ozon theme, and Beers embodies the transformation luminously, if not so flashily as some of the director's Gallic leading ladies.|Fresh
This sublime mature work by François Ozon borrows liberally from Ernst Lubitsch's Broken Lullaby (1932) but supplants its fevered melodrama with erotically charged mystery.|Fresh
Even if you know the twist - revealed halfway through the movie - there are enough feints here to make you wonder if the story is headed in a different direction.|Fresh
The deepening ties between Anna and Adrien have the same kind of dull, matte gloss of the black-and-white cinematography - monochrome that occasionally segues to color, an ill-conceived gambit occasioned by flashbacks and fleeting moments of joy.|Rotten
While it is far from Ozon's worst movie, it is perhaps the first one he's made that feels like it could be the work of any other director.|Rotten
Another major achievement from François Ozon.|Fresh
As if shedding a skin, the film shucks off its elegiac, white-gloved manners to explore a slippery realm of secrets, lies and moral uncertainty that eventually leads her to consult a priest for advice on how to proceed.|Fresh
Perhaps most important of Ozon's worldview is the film's universal humanism.|Fresh
Beer and Niney do solid work, but their sensitive efforts can't quite breathe life into a story that no longer seems terribly relevant.|Fresh
Shot in black and white, the movie occasionally blossoms into color at moments that make perfect sense, when monochromatic mourning is replaced by something like hope.|Fresh
The pacing is so humorless and funereal that it squelches the possibility of heat or conflict arising between the characters.|Rotten
This smooth-looking movie is taking moral risks.|Fresh
A heart-affecting and inventive drama about war, grief, forgiveness, and the healing powers of art.|Fresh
An exquisitely crafted tale about the friendship, even love, of two people on opposite sides of the fence, a German man and a French woman, just after World War One.|Fresh
Suffice it to say complications ensue within what plays like classic melodrama highlighted by top-shelf art direction, some powerfully evocative sequences that reflect postwar anger and Beer's magnificent performance.|Fresh
The film is almost velvety in its textured monochrome, and the plot turns like a weathervane in the wind; it's Ozon in top form.|Fresh
It's an epic and romantic examination of grief and the hostility between France and Germany in the post World War One era that also pauses to admire the cultural riches from both nations.|Fresh
A slick inter-war melodrama that promises more than it ultimately delivers.|Rotten
[Ozon's] complex sensibilities and fine-tuned irony are very evident in a mature work that transcends genre pastiche to be intellectually stimulating and emotionally satisfying.|Fresh
"Ozon may lack the so-called Lubitsch touch, but ""Frantz"" is a reminder that the French auteur has a firm one of his own."|Fresh
The results are oddly more artificial than the 1932 original, and considerably less moving.|Rotten
[Ozon's] story is one that's subtler and digs deeper while it keeps exploring how both political and personal questions are dealt with within a moral framework and how that framework itself is also open to interpretation.|Fresh
An aesthetic pleasure as a wrapping of an intense drama of unequivocally anti-war intentions. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The movie has a terrifically simple plot generating event which reaps bountiful plot threads and emotions.|Fresh
Frantz is a subtle drama in a black and white Germanic severity, and the major piece in the work of Ozon. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As well as stirring up big questions, Frantz will also have you swooning at its romance, and leaning forward to try and unknot its characters' mysteries.|Fresh
Reconciliation is the metaphor at the heart of this tender, involving love story.|Fresh
A failed remake of Broken Lullaby (1932) that doesn't manage to be realistic. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Ozon is often at his best when working with women, and he has a fabulous talent in Paula Beer to bring his protagonist, Anna, to vivid life. She's stunning in the role.|Fresh
Slightly over-polite, but the sense of festering postwar anger and pain is strong.|Fresh
As enticing as it is to get lost in its dazzling sleight of hand, there's too little to be found at the end to enlighten or even satisfy.|Fresh
A mostly dreary and heavy-handed affair that examines the damaging cost of nationalism and the toll that war takes on winners and losers, survivors and casualties alike.|Rotten
