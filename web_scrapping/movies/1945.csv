Handsomely shot in black and white and just 91 minutes, Torok's picture does not linger long, yet it manages to say so much that matters.|Fresh
[A] sombre, accomplished but somewhat heavy-handed work...|Fresh
As nationalist fervour and racism strengthens in modern-day Hungary, it is admirable that 1945 has been made at all.|Fresh
It's the original slant that 1945 offers on the Holocaust that makes it essential, if bleak viewing.|Fresh

Nationalism, protectionism, bigotry and stunning cruelty are the order of the day. The film is precise and stark in black and white. Even the weather and the animals and birds are foretelling doom.|Fresh

"A Hungarian Holocaust ""High Noon"""|Fresh
The film is nonetheless a trenchant examination of what happens in the wake of genocide, to survivors, witnesses, the participants and those who merely stood and watched.|Fresh
"Torok's powerfully absorbing tale juggles multiple characters and themes -- guilt, greed, justice. It's imperfect, but it has a crucial message about the complicity of ""little people"" in the context of unfathomably bigger crimes."|Fresh
1945 is an impeccably acted examination of the moral fester of the Holocaust, although the conclusion lacks the necessary impact.|Fresh
Driven by the agitation and anxiety of the town's populace, 1945 does... continue the exploration of an inexhaustible and inescapable subject.|Fresh
"[""1945""] is a piercing parable for modern times about how the moral costs of doing wrong - or standing silent while others do - can come due when we least expect it."|Fresh
The story is all the more effective thanks to its sparse and deliberate pacing, punctuated by a minimal soundtrack and black-and-white visuals.|Fresh
1945 serves as both a reminder of Hungary's complicity in the Holocaust and as an examination of what happens when an entire community is asked to keep one horrible secret.|Fresh
A quiet horror movie about grief and regret as spiritual possession, about rationalization and denial as immorality. We don't tell ourselves stories that whisper, as this one does, 'The Nazis had help.' We need to.|Fresh
This is a film that is wrenching to watch, but totally engrossing as tempers flare, suspense builds, as the series of seemingly small, meticulously observed, vignettes of village life unfold over the course of one pivotal day.|Fresh
A subtle but powerful look at the recent aftermath of World War II through the eyes of several residents of a small village in Soviet occupied Hungary.|Fresh
There are few films that take up the fortunes of European Jewish survivors in the aftermath of World War II. This one is a welcome addition to the theme of recuperation and restitution.|Fresh
If [Ferenc] Török takes his time identifying the characters and their relationships to each other, his seventh feature offers a particularly rewarding payoff, and Elemér Ragályi's daguerreotype-like cinematography stuns at every turn.|Fresh
The work of [director Ferenc Törok] is, first of all, a film of contrasts, of extremes in dispute. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Beautiful, harrowing, and ... cathartic, 1945 is a thoughtful meditation on the worst qualities of the human animal, and on those better aspects that offer hope for a brighter future.|Fresh
1945 is suspenseful, loud, in motion yet claustrophobic, practically a Western.|Fresh
The fateful year 1945 may seem like the distant past, but this movie is timely.|Fresh
"Refusing to hit us on the head with its message, 1945 instead subtly reveals the complicity of ""good"" people are capable of when outside forces target their neighbors."|Fresh
Shot in glorious black-and-white and featuring a score that evokes Thomas Newman at his most foreboding, 1945 is a low-key, claustrophobic study of how easily a little paranoia can cause people to bust out the pitchforks.|Fresh
The cast excels. Rudolf's Istvan powerfully personifies the moral collapse that so many Europeans displayed during the Nazi era.|Fresh
A dark picture, but its bleakness is necessary, with Szanto inching away from evil-that-men-do clichés to find something profoundly psychological.|Fresh
Subtlety is the delicate mechanism on which the filmmaker builds his story... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
1945, sobering and strangely uplifting, records horrid history, a comeuppance, a stand, and a retreat, while embracing a memorial.|Fresh
The uneasiness is heightened by the ever-present sound design and score by Tibor Szemzö, elevating delirious precision to devious nightmare.|Fresh
It's a fine addition to post-war films, just not one of the great ones.|Fresh
The film is about the destructive nature of such beliefs, and there's a clear sense of irony to the way that Szántó and Török allow that to happen.|Fresh
Poignant and melancholy, with the full weight of personal guilt driving the tension, 1945 is a monochrome film about a matter that is far from black and white.|Fresh
Török departs from the High Noon arc, and finds a way to end the movie with an invocation of violence, rather than an eruption of it.|Fresh
The heat haze and looming tension suggest a showdown in a western, but the weight of recent history applies its own vengeance, one that's transferred to the next generation.|Fresh
Echoes of other films mark this exercise of style that works more for its absence of pretensions than for the dramatization of an ethical conflict that falters due to stereotypical characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a good bet that the director had High Noon in mind when he made this film, but the comparison ends there. As a compact study of wartime guilt, the film has the look and feel of a waking nightmare.|Fresh
"Simple, powerful, made with conviction and skill, ""1945"" proceeds as inexorably as Sámuel and his son on their long walk into town."|Fresh
1945 ... a film that examines what happens in a village when the Jews start coming back after the Holocaust.|Fresh
"""1945"" is very highly recommended, but it probably requires sophisticated viewers."|Fresh
1945 is all about questions and apprehensions, not answers and catharses.|Fresh
The movie's denouement is indelible.|Fresh
The resultant sensation of uncomfortable prying underlines the boiling suspicions that power the plot.|Fresh
"""1945""is certainly both commendable and recommendable. It has something to say about complicity of everyday people in the crimes of society, and says so in a fairly quiet, methodical, unassuming way."|Fresh
A perfect film of its kind.|Fresh
Mesmerizing, quietly moving, and enthralling. It's one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
The fractured rhythm of 1945 and the desolate aesthetic are engrossing, but Ferenc Török's film doesn't linger.|Rotten
A Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon.|Fresh
A powerful parable of Biblical proportions, illustrating both man's inhumanity to man, as well as his capacity to forgive, if not necessarily to forget.|Fresh
Dramatically suspenseful, beautiful-looking, scarily evocative step back [as] guilt, recrimination, resentment and fear erupt in fields, houses, tavern, pharmacy and church.|Fresh
Few pictures dealing with the Holocaust examine as carefully and respectfully as this one the theft of Jewish homes by the local people and their resistance to returning the property to survivors.|Fresh
In this twitchy, claustrophobic view of moral degeneration, it becomes apparent that this town is not so much convulsed with guilt as with defensive anger.|Fresh
A fresh, intelligent cinematic approach to a difficult topic that takes on a transitional time in Hungarian history with subtlety and nuance.|Fresh
