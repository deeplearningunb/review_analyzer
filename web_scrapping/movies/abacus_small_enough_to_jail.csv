What cuts through the judicial fog and lines the undercarriage of the obviously misguided political attack on Abacus ... is a deeper question: What exactly are the societal functions of financial institutions in today's world?|Fresh
It's a slice of recent history that still has yet to become a part of the collective consciousness, but Abacus aims to play a small part in rectifying that.|Fresh
"Abacus"" reveals itself to be the most richly observed portrait of Chinese-American family life since Amy Tan's ""The Joy Luck Club"" and Wayne Wang's subsequent film adaptation."|Fresh
James tells this story with much empathy, not necessarily concerning himself with too much of the financial world's jargon, and instead focusing on those universal kernels that speak loudly and singly to us all.|Fresh
Abacus moves at a brisk pace and never feels dry or procedural.|Fresh
A deserved nominee for Best Documentary at this year's Academy Awards, Abacus is as fascinating as it is likely to foment rage.|Fresh
The perfectly conventionally doc is quite revealing of systemic racism and other grander issues in America and its judicial system.|Fresh
Informative but dry docu on the trial of a small bank.|Fresh
It's a truly fascinating film ... that will make you scratch your head in wonder that this was the only prosecutorial response to the financial misdeeds of the last decade.|Fresh

We may never get a comprehensive history of what really went down at Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, or Countrywide. On the other hand, thanks to Steve James and the Kartemquin group, we know all about Abacus Federal Savings Bank.|Fresh
This documentary tells the David and Goliath story of a multi million dollar criminal prosecution of a small bank in New York's Chinatown, seemingly picked on by prosecutors because it appeared to be small and powerless.|Fresh
A gripping tale of corruption in the Chinese-American community.|Fresh
... deceptively straightforward new film from Hoop Dreams director Steve James.|Fresh
An acutely observed portrait of the lives of first and second generation Chinese immigrants, subjects who otherwise don't see much in the way of Hollywood limelight.|Fresh
The modesty of its subjects, both corporate and human, clearly rubbed off on James who has crafted a standardly assembled yet no less enthralling documentary about what is now a particularly peculiar footnote in the history of American law|Fresh
When Steve James's documentary suggests that Abacus was the victim of a concerted Establishment plot... it doesn't have quite enough evidence for a conviction, but it is an absorbing study of the court case, the bank and Chinatown itself.|Fresh
A sweet and sometimes moving, if ultimately minor, film about a hopelessly inadequate fraud case from 2012.|Fresh
This intricate but accessible study seeks to put a human face on the 2008 credit crunch and its aftermath.|Fresh
Disarmingly human moments - the Sung daughters, all high-powered lawyers, fret over their 80-year-old father's disappointing sandwich - pepper this compelling courtroom drama.|Fresh
Yet again, it is a story of the fat cats and the thin cats - and a reminder of how Milton Friedman's maxim applies to the bank bailouts: socialism for the rich, free enterprise for the poor.|Fresh
This modern David and Goliath tale shines a light not only on the injustices heaped upon Abacus, but also the systematic targeting of marginalised immigrant communities by an establishment desperate to protect the status quo.|Fresh
What James ensures you'll take away from the documentary is the moral fortitude of the Sung family.|Fresh
How many banks were held accountable for this bad-mortgage-fuelled disaster? Exactly one, and that's the subject of the latest provocation from Steve James.|Fresh
[The film] use[s] a complex legal proceeding as a way to examine this family and this community, and James does so with his usual, personal touch.|Fresh
The film works at once as a compelling, tangled legal story, a depiction of Chinatown's world within a world, and a portrait of those who live there and shape it as they try to bridge the gap between one world and the other.|Fresh
Another underdog story, though in this case, the underdog takes the unlikely form of a New York bank that trafficked in dubious mortgages.|Fresh
James excels at drawing out the dynamics of extended families under stress and Abacus is no exception.|Fresh
Abacus: Small Enough to Jail works as both a true-life legal thriller and a portrait of a tight-knit community under a tone-deaf siege.|Fresh
The result is an interesting tale, though a little dry at times.|Fresh
The film's director, who would make an excellent character witness for the defence, raises ... questions but frustratingly doesn't answer them in an otherwise compelling documentary.|Fresh
Seemingly a story of bank operator-regulator mutually assured embarrassment, there is more beneath the surface.|Fresh
When James captures the Sung family during their lived-in moments, Abacus: Small Enough to Jail improves from a trial procedural to a cinematic vision of the American Dream under siege.|Fresh
... invites cynicism and conspiracy theories regarding the injustice of it all, yet James keeps his focus on the kind-hearted people behind the scenes.|Fresh
Don't be surprised if this chilling expose leaves you convinced the Sungs were innocent victims of a thoroughly corrupt legal system doling out 'justice' in color-coded fashion, even when it comes to white-collar crime.|Fresh
James offers compelling context and frames the case with a potent emotional plea embodied in the sincerity of his subjects.|Fresh
This is a critically important film.|Fresh
It is at its strongest when it is essentially an underdog story: a family drawing together to fight back against the sweeping power of the United States government, because, as Sung repeatedly expresses to the camera, it's the right thing to do.|Fresh
As gripping as the movie is as a legal thriller, it's even more notable as a portrait of a community.|Fresh
"The documentary hearkens back to Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"". I prefer the documentary."|Fresh
The film persuasively argues that any fraud at Abacus occurred at a low level, and that the bank dealt with it swiftly and properly.|Fresh
Abacus: Small Enough to Jail is a compelling non-fiction thriller. It should engross most viewers, even those who've resisted learning what a subprime mortgage is.|Fresh
James' essentially humanist mode of documentary filmmaking can't cut through the surface of the surface.|Rotten
The little-known story of the trial of a Chinatown family-owned bank in the wake of the financial debacle of 2008.|Fresh
Steve James's film is a rallying cry, and its weaknesses as art might bolster its strength as reformatory theater.|Rotten
A stunning David-and-Goliath epic.|Fresh
James spins a fascinating and complex web involving lies, fraud, a months-long trial with a hung jury, and cultural biases against Abacus and the immigrant Chinese community it serves.|Fresh
Abacus: Small Enough To Jail isn't as grand or engrossing a treatise as Hoop Dreams or The Interrupters, but in its intimate, well-observed way, the film is deeply moving and subtly shaming.|Fresh
A minor but touchingly human subplot to the financial crash, Abacus: Small Enough to Jail is both an affirmation and an indictment of the American Dream.|Fresh
James has always been a filmmaker fascinated by community, and Abacus doubles as an engrossing glimpse inside cloistered Chinatown customs and an immigrant population looking out for one another because it's infuriatingly obvious that nobody else will.|Fresh
Detailing the bizarre chain of events is overwhelming at times, with too few court sketches to represent a rapid-fire cross-examination.|Rotten
The legal machinations are less interesting than the Sung family's refusal to be scapegoated. As James follows their case through the courts, his movie turns into a crackling family drama.|Fresh
Engrossing.|Fresh
Not without its blind spots, but James locates both familial intimacy and a bigger picture without sentimentalising his subject.|Fresh
"The movie wants us to raise our fists and shout, ""Yes, that's what happened. And it's an outrage!"" Instead, you may feel like raising your hand and asking ""Is that really what happened? If so, it's an outrage! Now please show us some evidence."""|Rotten
Steve James displays his usual savvy for picking culturally resonant topics in his latest documentary.|Fresh
Abacus is an exemplary piece of filmmaking, an investigation into two kinds of double standards.|Fresh
While the film never reaches the kind of emotional peaks of James' best work ... Abacus: Small Enough To Jail is no less compelling.|Fresh
James has rarely tackled a subject as explicitly issue-based. There's not much question who's side he's on, but he refuses to reduce the complexities of this case.|Fresh
