Mira Nair's picture is too long, but you can forgive such an inspiring tale a lot, especially when it is so clear-eyed about poverty in modern Africa. Be sure to stick around for the end credits.|Fresh

Queen of Katwe isn't your typical feel-good Disney movie or biopic, but that's another strength. With winning performances by the two stars and young Nalwanga, it's the kind of film that sticks with you.|Fresh
With its empowering message and determined heroine, this sweetly intelligent movie finds real inspiration in a remarkable true story.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is your quintessential triumph-of-the-underdog story - predictable, yet inspiring. It may unfold slowly just like a game of chess but stimulates your heart and mind, nonetheless.|Fresh
Engages your head and heart in equal measure.|Fresh
After the efforts of the actors its director Mira Nair's deft handling of the subject that makes Queen Of Katwe such a delightful and genuine film.|Fresh
She (Mira Nair) draws wonderful performances from her young, unknown cast, shooting street scenes with powerful authenticity and delivering a heart-warming and refreshingly original story that you'll be pleased you've seen.|Fresh
The irresistible ringer for gullible audiences is that the movie is based on a true story.|Rotten
Queen of Katwe is a tough triumph of will that doesn't limit itself by focusing so narrowly on the game alone.|Fresh
What I liked about Queen of Katwe is something mainstream American audiences rarely see: an inspiring family film that doesn't try to gloss up the protagonist's impoverished backstory.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is a movie committed to the real people whose story it tells, showing their struggles, strength, love and faith.|Fresh
Oyelowo and Nyong'o's performances temper the film with heart-wrenching emotion. And Mira Nair's touching portrait of Katwe's inspiring young queen with a dream is one to remember.|Fresh
Aimed at tweens and upwards rather than young kids, Queen of Katwe offers something we don't see often; an accessible, enjoyable story delivered in a mature and understated manner.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is hardly revolutionary but it defies one defining convention of the familiar Disney underdog/culture clash drama: it presents no white savior or mentor to be inspired by the third world / underprivileged characters as he gives them hope.|Fresh
Mira Nair's socially observant chess drama looks spectacular on Disney's Blu-ray release, which flawlessly retains the film's rich and integral color palette.|Fresh
Overall, the film is not without its flaws. However, in the end, you aren't just rooting for Phiona, but also for all of those who have found themselves in similar situations.|Fresh
For every clich the film indulges, another is skirted, and another subverted. By the end, every ounce of feelgood is deserved.|Fresh
Even with a clearly signposted ending, it still manages to offer surprises. Nair delights in Uganda, painting a country of many social contrasts and cultures; she embraces possibility, not poverty.|Fresh
When the feel good finish rolls round, you feel it's been fully earned.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe walks the line between integrity and accessibility with grace and dignity.|Fresh
Proves the kind of movie that makes its plays known several moves in advance, but that doesn't diminish the moving end result.|Fresh
While this strongly-acted, Disney-produced, factually-based drama from Indian director Mira Nair tries too hard at times to be inspirational and uplifting, it actually is anyway.|Fresh
It is hard to think of a film in 2016 that has not been better cast from the first lead actors right down to the last extras.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is in many respects your typical feel-good sports story, elevated by the ways that it does diverge from the formula.|Fresh
A comforting and entertaining film with a politically correct message. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Queen of Katwe may suggest the title of a Disney animated princess (like the lamentable The Princess and the Frog), but all possibilities of romantic fantasy are submerged in the film's semi-documentary reporting on eternal Third World poverty.|Rotten
The story hits plenty of familiar beats, yet its setting and the actors' conviction combine to give it a feel-good freshness.|Fresh
It's uplifting, feel-good, nice, well shot and really well acted.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe mostly does what you expect it to do (albeit vivaciously). Then, like its Ugandan heroine, Phiona Mutesi, it jumps eight moves ahead.|Fresh
The picture pulses with colour, vitality and the locals' natural ebullience, without glossing over grim realities too much.|Fresh
As feelgood stories of empowerment go, this has a ring of authenticity and mixes intelligence with irreducible emotional immediacy.|Fresh
[Queen of Katwe is] a film that, like the best Disney fare, connects on some deep and profound level with that part of us that still seeks to improve ourselves -- and, who knows, perhaps even the world.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is notable not only for being an utterly gripping story about playing chess, which can be decidedly uncinematic; but also for being joyfully uplifting, without ever feeling forced.|Fresh
This Disney drama manages to avoid patronising sentimentality with an uplifting and punchy look at the conflicts faced by 14-year-old Phiona.|Fresh
It's a fantastic, feelgood story; one that neatly conforms to the beats of a classic sporting underdog movie: think Rocky and the Rooks or The Bad News Bears with Bishops.|Fresh
A set of solid performances power this underdog flick to victory.|Fresh
Maybe it runs a little long and perhaps some of the child actors are a little unpolished, but overall it's an assured move into new territory by the House of Mouse.|Fresh
It's a Disney film but not overly Disneyfied. It feels thoroughly authentic.|Fresh
It follows the classic tearjerking formula of a Rocky film but still emerges as an inspirational, old-fashioned charmer.|Fresh
We already know from his turn as Martin Luther King Jr in Selma that Oyelowo can be stirring in a statesmanlike role, but here he brings a similar kind of moral conviction to a far humbler underdog character.|Fresh
What could have so easily been turned into a sickly-sweet, coming-of-age story actually ends up being a realistic and warm celebration of family, faith and having a sense of purpose that will leave you feeling both moved.|Fresh
It is a thoroughly heartwarming story in which you're rooting so hard for the heroine that you scarcely notice how contrived some of Nair's dramatic gambits really are.|Fresh
It's a heartfelt movie, which makes up in warmth what it lacks in narrative originality.|Fresh
There is always something to tickle the eye.|Fresh
The strongest piece of Mira Nair's joyous Queen of Katwe is Madina Nalwanga.|Fresh
Rarely makes an unpredictable move. But it has warmth, a lively sense of pace, and a fine breakout turn from Madina Nalwanga ...|Fresh
Its plot isn't going to win any prizes for originality, but Nair tells the story with immense warmth and cheer. You can see just about every move coming, but it's making all the right ones.|Fresh
It was refreshing to see director Nair take such an honest look at Africa.|Fresh
Nair (emphasizes) authenticity in both performance and setting. She plants the seed early on, and never fails to fertilize that soil.|Fresh
It's just what America always needs: Disney teaming up with its partners at ESPN to give us an inspirational (minor) sports movie we've seen oh so many times before. Admittedly, 'Queen of Katwe' does get some some lift from the game of chess and Uganda.|Fresh
Harnessing the power of understatement, Nalwanga gives a wonderfully engrossing turn helped along by the sensitive camerawork, while an energetic Oyelowo and an estimable Nyong'o provide the classy support.|Fresh
This slumdog champion story has a mandated happy ending, but it is satisfyingly hard won.|Fresh
This crowd-pleaser is bolstered by intelligent scripting, crafted direction and strong performances, making the uplift feel earned.|Fresh
It's a quiet and sturdy installment to Nair's impressive filmography and an under-the-radar delight for 2016.|Fresh
This movie is as much a romantic homage to the melodramas of the past as it is a radical, path-breaking piece of modern filmmaking. It is one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Another dreadfully well-intentioned, insipidly inspirational sports movie from Disney,|Rotten
Queen of Katwe is able to easily overcome its handful of flaws to become a beacon and standard for future live-action Disney's films.|Fresh
Inspirational journey - with compassionate performances - concluding that being a winner can be a mixed blessing.|Fresh
Why are you fooling around on your laptop when you could be watching this beautiful movie?|Fresh
Means well, but its laborious, too-gentle pace drags it down into vegetable territory (i.e., a movie you watch because it's good for you).|Rotten
The script accentuates its clichs with well-rounded characters and real-life heartbreak, carrying it high above its Disney sports movie relatives.|Fresh
I loved the way that the film shows so much patience, that it allows things to develop at their own naturalistic pace.|Fresh
Watching chess is like watching grass grow. But this movie is so inspiring it doesn't matter.|Fresh
If that story here sometimes lapses into formula, the dazzling color (oranges and yellows and magentas) and thrilling energy and sheer art of each scene help to make that formula less burdensome, to make these places vibrant and marvelous.|Fresh
Nalwanga's performance is well supported by veterans Oyelowo and Wyong'o.|Fresh
Fiercely protective and suspicious of her daughter's new pastime, Nyong'o's wonderfully expressive face reflects her entire life story. Her scenes with Oyelowo are an acting master class.|Fresh
Every game of chess has its overt attacks and its stealthy ones, and the chess-based drama Queen of Katwe is no different.|Fresh
Chess isn't the most cinematic of pastimes, yet Nair finds ways to make each match as exciting as any soccer or basketball game.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is that rare movie about Africa that doesn't involve war or disease or any other kind of large-scale death, and these performances help this remarkable story earn its uplift honestly.|Fresh
An inspiring true story with great performances.|Fresh
Get caught up in the sentiment, brush past some glaring overdubbing, and this is the kind of story you'll know very well told in rare fashion.|Fresh
The Queen of Katwe is a sports movie for people who don't like sports movies. A tearjerker for those who don't like tearjerkers. An inspirational story for those who don't like inspirational stories.|Fresh
Not only is [Madina Nalwanga] able to convey Phiona's preternatural abilities, but also the trepidation and fears that arise once the child gets a sense of her own keenness and a glimpse of how life is lived outside the slums of Katwe.|Fresh
Largely avoids exaggeration to make a grander point of hope and brilliance coming together in one unique girl, and it's a must-see for those tired of the blockbuster and genre routine, with its human touch powerful and achingly sincere.|Fresh
The honesty of the performances more than makes up for slight amounts of hokiness in the telling.|Fresh
Offers a pleasant variation on a comfortable formula.|Fresh
Poor Ugandan girl Phiona Mutesi (Madina Nalwanga) becomes a chess champion in this fascinating true story. Some fine performances raise the bar on this overlong, but inspirational, film with a few good moves.|Fresh
Nair skillfully plays the limited board this story gives her, a queen among filmmakers making all the right moves.|Fresh
It shirks the typical Disney model of an untouchable, picturesque fantasy by telling a more grounded, human story coursing with love and earnestness.|Fresh
The ensemble is seamless.|Fresh
A co-production of Disney and ESPN Films, Queen of Katwe unsurprisingly has a calculated quality to it...What's thrilling is the story's girl power, with Phiona described as an aggressive player of 'astonishing power.'|Fresh
Mira Nair is an emotional button-pusher of Spielbergian ability.|Fresh
"Nair saves her best move for last, when during the end credits she stirringly shows the real-life characters beside the actors who played them. It's the ""Queen's"" crowning achievement."|Fresh
Triumphant celebration of mind of real girl in Africa with help of Pollyanna. . .Vividly filmed on location. . . Score marvelously uses traditions...Pacing gets repetitive.|Fresh
[O]ften uplifting, often heartbreaking, & always absorbing, filled with impressive performances & a subversion of Western expectations that make it rise above the other entries in the genre over the last few years.|Fresh
Nair makes sure there's a real person with real skill and real passion working the levers, imbuing even the corniest moment with real feeling.|Fresh
With The Queen of Katwe, Mira Nair really has created something quite special.|Fresh
'Queen of Katwe' is an exceptional movie anchored by great acting, a life-affirming story and the proof there are diamonds hidden all around us just waiting for their chance to shine.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is a heavy-handed variation of the Disney inspirational sports drama formula, but a sincere and well-meaning one too.|Fresh
It's quietly triumphant, told modestly and straightforwardly.|Fresh
There's a decent strategy to this slick biopic about a teenage chess prodigy from Uganda that manages to be heartwarming without turning excessively sappy.|Fresh
Mira Nair's inspirational chess drama Queen of Katwe is remarkable in the simplest but most profound way: it's an American film about Africa that doesn't feel like it was made by tourists.|Fresh
Makes painfully plain the tug of war between getting an education and putting food on the table, dreams and survival, the future and right now.|Fresh
A real-life transformative fable from filmmaker Mira Nair with a unique and vibrant setting. All that and Lupita Nyong'o.|Fresh
[Nair] manages to do justice to these people's lives, and when, at the end, the real-life characters show up on-screen and stand smiling beside their actor counterparts, the screen lights up along with the audience.|Fresh
Nair...doesn't shy from the harsh realities of life in Katwe...[she] also revels in the colors and textures of this world: clay-orange earth, bright fabrics, weatherbeaten bricks and wood.|Fresh
A winning underdog pic where newcomer Madina Nalwanga shines. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Inspiring true tale of girl Ugandan chess champ.|Fresh
Entertaining and engrossing and funny and heartwarming.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe's originality comes not in its story but in its setting, explored by Nair with her usual skill at establishing a sense of place.|Fresh
The material might have become fodder for a standard piece of uplift, but Queen of Katwe is better than that.|Fresh
[William] Wheeler's screenplay avoids the trappings of biography to tell a bigger story.|Fresh
You've seen this movie so many times before...But with Nyong'o on board, director Mira Nair and screenwriter William Wheeler have found this story's true heart, that of a mother's faith.|Fresh
...hits all the necessary beats of the inspirational sports drama and concludes with a crowning moment of awesome...|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is remarkable in its characters, narrative, and world-building, an example of unexpected storytelling that transcends its chess origins.|Fresh
"In the movie, Phiona can see eight moves ahead, and ""Queen of Katwe"" often feels the same: You know what's coming, but it doesn't dilute the feeling of victory."|Fresh
A treat. With a story that works on multiple levels for young and adult audiences and outstanding performances, this is definitely a family film worth checking out.|Fresh
Nair has a great eye, and a great gift for creating vibrant, layered, wonderfully inviting communities on screen.|Fresh
Warm, heartfelt and uplifting despite a cloying and contrived screenplay. Mira Nair is the perfect director for such a film because her films are always brimming with humanism, a truly special effect.|Fresh
"""To find where you belong... sometimes you must make your move"" is the Disney-approved, no-doubt-focus-tested tagline that bubbles up in block letters during the trailer... That's how groan-inducingly broad this stuff is."|Rotten
Ultimately, Queen of Katwe fosters a belief in the triumph of merit and talent. And that message is definitely applicable - to Western kids.|Fresh
A genuine delight and a true surprise.|Fresh
There are no real villains, save for a few snobby bureaucrats. Emotional buttons are occasionally pushed a little hard. But true to her reputation, Nair delivers something a little better than one expects of the genre.|Fresh
The film as a whole conveys a strong sense of discovery, and humanity.|Fresh
What sets Queen of Katwe apart from other inspirational stories of its kind is that Phiona's dreams are a double-edged sword.|Fresh
An uplifting and emotional story rendered with a lively vibrancy by Nair and her stars|Fresh
While it follows a formula one might expect from a Disney/ESPN co-production, the true story of chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi is anything but common.|Fresh
Here director Mira Nair, working from a script by William Wheeler, brings a lot of thoughtful shading to a tale of triumph over adversity, resulting in a film that's at once rousing and moving.|Fresh
Sometimes, it's enough to walk out of a film with your heart warmed - even if your brain's still craving a little something more.|Fresh
In the end, the obvious weaknesses in Queen of Katwe's script hardly matter, as most viewers will realize that they've discovered something new and worthwhile-a place and a people they've never before seen or acknowledged.|Fresh
It's a mere fulfillment of familiar tropes, but it approaches sports movie's conventions with a light, funk-inflected touch.|Fresh
Queen Of Katwe is pretty typical Disney magic, but dynamic performances add a little more oomph to Phiona Mutesi's amazing true story.|Fresh
It's a team effort, and even though we know this playbook by heart, cheers all around.|Fresh
A sweet film that sticks to a tried-and-true formula and still manages to inspire.|Fresh
David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong'o are reliably superb in the critical supporting roles of Mutesi's chess coach and young mother, respectively.|Fresh
Disney's latest real-life tale of overcoming adversity is a slight but pleasant exercise in uplift that's utterly familiar except for its African setting.|Rotten
"Subtlety isn't the strong suit of ""Queen of Katwe."" But beneath the hackneyed aphorisms, there's a thrilling story worthy of our attention."|Fresh
If there is anyone out there capable of remaining unmoved by this true-life triumph-of-the-underdog sports story, I don't think I want to meet that person.|Fresh
There's much to cheer about a movie with such a diverse cast of talent both familiar and new, set in a land that all too often is depicted on screen as a place of war and hopelessness.|Fresh
It deals in a world of pawns rather than punches but Queen of Katwe is just as uplifting and feel-good a sports drama as any Rocky movie.|Fresh
Nair's film, her best in a long time, is hardly the first to use a chessboard as a symbol of one life's struggles. It is, however, one of the best.|Fresh
"What redeems ""Queen of Katwe"" is the performance of Oyelowo, who imbues Katende with an exhilarating blend of humor and humanity."|Fresh
"Just try to resist the charms of Mira Nair's ""Queen of Katwe,"" a triumph-of-the-human-spirit movie that's ultimately, well, triumphant."|Fresh
While it hits predictable beats of uplift, the triumphs are often measured out painfully, and the heroine faces barriers of class, gender, and crippling self-doubt.|Fresh
Director Mira Nair has a proven ability to find beauty in the most desperate of circumstances, and Queen Of Katwe is no different.|Fresh
Singing and sincere, this film easily sails past the limitations of William Wheeler's script. When rendered with a pure heart, sacrifice and devotion can never be oversold.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe shows that a film doesn't have to give up on the tenets of genre, but has the potential to win big if it can enliven them in new ways.|Fresh
Chess is not the most visual of games, but Nair makes these competitions come alive. She also gets the most out of her mostly nonprofessional African cast, not to mention her two stars, Oyelowo and Nyong'o.|Fresh
Although the script is a little flat - just because the story is true doesn't mean it should feel so predictable - Nair gives the film tons of energy and joy.|Fresh
Queen of Katwe is a true-life tale transformed into an inspirational fable. That's not novel for the movies, but in this director's hands, the results are mostly enchanting.|Fresh
Nyong'o's gravitas is undercut by a script teeming with wooden platitudes, special lessons learned, and the overbaked dialogue of a Joan Crawford melodrama.|Rotten
It's about as good as you hoped it would be...|Fresh
A story that works within the broad strokes of familiarity, but fills them in with vibrancy, humanity, and emotion.|Fresh
'Queen of Katwe's a film that's thoughtful, charming, and heartwarming. It's nice to have sports heroes who are physically gifted, but it's nice to see a movie that celebrates a smart woman at the top of her game.|Fresh
Director Mira Nair's fact based tale is moving and inspiring.|Fresh
In Nair's hands, Queen of Katwe radiates with rich, considered attention to detail in each facet of Phiona's journey.|Fresh
"The story of Phiona Mutesi is a fascinating one on its own, but what could have just been an extended ""30 For 30"" feels lived-in, compassionate and truthful."|Fresh
Queen Of Katwe lacks the intensity that the story needs. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
By treating its outcome like a foregone conclusion, Queen of Katwe underserves the built-in power of its exultant tale.|Rotten
This humanistic tale, helmed by a masterful filmmaker, offers a potent -- and yes, inspirational -- story of triumph against huge odds.|Fresh
Ultimately, Queen of Katwe is what you expect -- charming though a bit paint-by-numbers -- but Nyong'o and Oyelowo's presence as well as Nair's warm, hopeful depiction of Uganda elevate the film.|Fresh
What a vibrant, lively, yet understated joy Queen of Katwe is.|Fresh
There are movies that please crowds, and there are movies determined to be crowd-pleasers. Queen Of Katwe is the latter, a brightly coloured and insistently upbeat true story that never stops reminding you how inspirational it is.|Rotten
Queen Of Katwe tells a potentially touching story in the stodgiest of ways, its recounting of the journey of a young Ugandan chess prodigy sensitively rendered but also far too formulaic.|Rotten
Nair has created a film with an indelibly enchanting tone, enhanced by the use of traditional African music that helps inform the atmosphere and add a distinctive geniality to proceedings.|Fresh
Hits every note of plucky positivity so squarely on the head that it leaves little room for audience involvement.|Rotten
For what is, in essence, a by-numbers Disney sports flick, there's endless freshness and vivacity to Mira Nair's picture - her best in years.|Fresh
Queen Of Katwe's biggest gift is that it opens up a window to a world rarely depicted on screen outside of random documentaries and international news reports.|Fresh
Quietly radical in enough ways to make you cheer despite the cliches.|Fresh
Prepare to have your heartstrings plucked.|Fresh
