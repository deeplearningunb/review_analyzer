The scant 82 minute runtime manages to pack a shocking amount of heart.|Fresh
Menashe has a tenderness to it that is hard to decry, and because it's shorter than your average film, it doesn't have the time to go off the rails and become something it's not.|Fresh
This a touching film that depicts the father/son relationship in a manner that feels as authentic as its setting.|Fresh
Weinstein walks a tightrope similar to the one of his main character, and though Menashe may occasionally falter, this director impressively does not in his first feature.|Fresh
Writer/director Joshua Z Weinstein is a documentary maker and this is his first feature but it has a very verité, naturalistic feel.|Fresh
It's a touching and nuanced film, and so skillfully made that you quickly get over the novelty of the fact that its characters are speaking Yiddish and get right into the story.|Fresh
Weinstein's ability to notch up the dramatic side of the story without bringing manipulative tricks into play is praiseworthy. His work serves up a tart platter that gives you food for thought.|Fresh
A small tale of beauty, sadness and undeniable fascination ... In a way, the film is a kind of documentary hybrid; we're seeing a story, but what we're really watching is the milieu, which has never been depicted on film before with this veracity.|Fresh
Joshua Z. Weinstein's film is very modest but never less than interesting in the insights it offers into this rarefied world on the edge of Manhattan.|Fresh
An engaging family drama, performed entirely in Yiddish and set within Brooklyn's ultra-orthodox Jewish community of Borough Park.|Fresh

[Boasts] an observational approach, naturalistic appearance, fly-on-the-wall feel and authentic air.|Fresh
Menashe Lustig's performance here is strong, in a subtly understated way, and there are a few - but very few - mildly emotionally resonant scenes.|Fresh
It's a film that just keeps getting stronger as it goes, unfolding almost imperceptibly and becoming deeper with each scene.|Fresh
Fortunately, this is not just a hard-nosed dissection of hardliners. Everyone here is a human being capable of change and growth.|Fresh
Weinstein deliberately underplays the emotions of the story, preferring to sit back and observe the Hasidic community and Menashe's place in it.|Fresh
Menashe credits its audience with enough tenacity and intelligence to dig beneath its gentle nature and ascribe meaning to the film's subtle gestures.|Fresh
... a world that is in many ways quite different from modern secular life in New York City, but the issues of loneliness and family strife are all too universal.|Fresh
... the film's naturalistic performances recall the great films of Italian neorealism and pioneering indie directors like John Cassavetes.|Fresh
A bittersweet, deeply human tale, one with a documentary sense of discovery to its setting: a little seen, highly insular ultraorthodox Jewish community.|Fresh
Menashe wants to be a good single parent so badly, and his earnest intentions are sympathetic, but the film does a stupendously cruel job making you question if he ever could be.|Fresh
It goes within one of the world's most filmed cities to discover an environment rarely revealed to outsiders. But it also wins kudos for the emotional honesty of its uncomplicated narrative.|Fresh
It's a touching, intimate film conducted mainly in Yiddish, and while the culture is particular, the human problems are universal.|Fresh
Weinstein's quiet study of Hasidic society is part of the film's appeal, but the story's crux would have potential in any context.|Fresh
This terrifically authentic look at life inside New York's Yiddish-speaking Hasidic community is a bittersweet treat - a vibrantly engaging portrait of down-to-earth lives that is affectionate, amusing and ultimately very moving.|Fresh
A modest tale inspired by the lead actor's own experiences.|Fresh
These are the films we celebrate.|Fresh
Whatever pickle he gets himself in, we can't help but root for Menashe.|Fresh
It is small and specific, admittedly, but it also tells a universal story about a father's struggle to hold on to the son he loves, and it tells this story tenderly, thoughtfully, beautifully.|Fresh
Menashe is utterly absorbing, deeply charming, and very funny. It's an impressive first narrative feature by documentarian Joshua Z Weinstein, who brings an assured intimacy to the screen from the outset.|Fresh
Menashe is a deeply felt and absorbing Yiddish-language drama about New York Hasidic Jews.|Fresh
A brave step into uncharted territories. The superb leading performance from Menashe Lustig elevates this beautifully observed film. Well worth your time.|Fresh
Performed in Yiddish and shot in Brooklyn's Borough Park, this is a rare insight into Orthodox Jewish culture.|Fresh
Doubling as a fascinating look at a subculture that is normally sealed off from the rest of us and a gently amusing comedy of manners, this manages to say an awful lot by, paradoxically, saying it endearingly gently.|Fresh
Menashe is a pretty basic story regarding child custody, but it benefits from the setting and the unfamiliarity of the Hasidic Jewish community|Fresh
The effort to raise a child, Menashe reminds us, is as likely to confront us with our own childishness as it is to bring out our maturity and responsibility.|Fresh
Menashe is a film that's about a man who has been dealt a bad thing in his life and he's doing the best that he can.|Fresh
"""Menashe"" is a slice of an America that you've rarely seen before on screen, a world that largely remains from the mainstream, but to which Weinstein shows us a bird's eye view of here."|Fresh
Menashe is the most human and humane of dramas.|Fresh
The hyper-specificity of [a] community, and the deep respect for faith that the movie observes, makes it easy for Menashe to reinvent the everyman tragedy.|Fresh
At its heart, Menashe is a universal story.|Fresh
Ultimately, thanks to a sympathetic and nuanced performance from Lustig, Menashe offers a thoughtful portrait of the challenge of parenthood and the struggle to be a man and a father.|Fresh
Certainly Weinstein captures the complex culture of this ultra-Orthodox community... That sense of a community, and how an oddball like Menashe learns to live within it, is what makes Menashe so fascinating and universal.|Fresh
Poignant, but shot through with welcome touches of humor, it opens a door to an unfamiliar culture, and does so with honesty and heart.|Fresh
Though Menashe is modest in both presentation and power (it's essentially a character study with a very tight narrative arc, 'one week in the life of') it's sympathetically told and occasionally funny and enraging.|Fresh
[It] raises questions about religion and conformity but never challenges them directly. Instead, it offers a rare window into a religious community that steers clear of modern society, and into a man who, with his foibles and frailties, is all too human.|Fresh
Menashe the film is so intimate and so nuanced in its depiction of the woes of Menashe the character that there's really no need for anything else.|Fresh
The movie is such an immersive portrayal of an insular world rarely seen onscreen that the thin story isn't a major problem.|Fresh
"This film, running under 90 minutes, rightly deserves to be slotted in the category ""slice of life."""|Fresh
A neorealist take on Hasidic life that is fascinating, if slightly repetitive.|Fresh
Menashe offers much food for thought.|Fresh
The Yiddish-language Menashe wants to highlight the universality of thorny family dynamics, but it's better at highlighting the universality of drearily well-intentioned Sundance drama clichés.|Rotten
[Joshua Z. ] Weinstein's Menashe succeeds in doing what many good films do; it opens the door to a world most of us don't really know.|Fresh
'Menashe' could have used a bit more fire and spirit. It's commendable that Weinstein does not overly dramatize the prime conflict, but that also dilutes the film's poignancy.|Fresh
It leaves you feeling touched, and just a bit more enlightened. To that, all I can say is mazel tov!|Fresh
Delicate laughs ensue ... with some meaningful moments of emotion popping up as needed in this unusually framed, slice-of-life tale.|Fresh
I don't want to give anything away, but eventually audience members who are paying attention might conclude that Menashe isn't simply having a run of bad luck.|Fresh
[Director Joshua] Weinstein, one feels, comes to Borough Park not to judge but to quietly observe.|Fresh
"The burly Lustig has a melancholy quality - he plays ""himself"" as a fellow with a good heart, but one who's become a little too comfortable with failure."|Fresh
The end product is heartfelt yet complex, a story which is refreshing in its simultaneous narrative simplicity and psychological depth, but unfortunately it is just not very well made.|Rotten
Sensitive and sympathetic character study, offering gentle insight into a self-segregated community.|Fresh
"""Menashe"" is a movie that by all rights should not exist. Sitting in the theater, watching this film for the first time, I was preoccupied throughout with the question of how the hell this movie came into being."|Fresh
Delicately woven and sensitively told, director-writer Joshua Z Weinstein's ode to a shlemiel rings true.|Fresh
It provides plenty of observations of the man's flaws, while offering no judgment of those flaws.|Fresh
Menashe shows that even though a father may eat, pray, and love differently, his bond with his son is something anyone can comprehend.|Fresh
"In scene after scene, ""Menashe"" strikes complex notes without telegraphing how the audience should feel."|Fresh
Despite being set in an almost impenetrably closed society, Menashe is a touching story with the universal theme of being unable to fit in a world of hard rules and expected behavior.|Fresh
"Some of the narrative developments and conversational tangents feel contrived, but ""Menashe"" has a rhythm (brisk but unforced) that speaks well of Weinstein's future in narrative storytelling."|Fresh
This is Weinstein's first dramatic feature; he's been a documentarian, and that comes through in his ability to show Menashe in the context of his world.|Fresh
The script seems overly determined to knock its hero down, when the people around him could stand to do some growing up.|Rotten
The formulaic narrative is made unpredictable by the authentic surroundings and the potential complications of religion. But it's still formulaic.|Fresh
First time feature film director Joshua Z. Weinstein uses his documentary skills to put us in the midst of Menashe's life.|Fresh
Menashe is all about capturing the painful dynamic of feeling completely alienated, even when you're in a room surrounded by people just like you.|Fresh
At times sweet, but never patronizing, Menashe examines a world that might seem foreign or oppressive without ever turning its inhabitants into caricatures or figures of fun.|Fresh
Menashe Lustig creates an endearing character, hapless and disheveled, barely scraping by, whose every attempt to do the right thing seems fated for failure.|Fresh
Menashe may be a film of understated storytelling and plot, but its pleasures lie primarily in the wonderfully observational approach that Weinstein takes to his protagonist.|Fresh
"Sympathy is generated...but not sustained drama...Sensitive portrayal [but] such a respectfully realistic but modest story as Menashe can leave the audience saying ""So nu?""."|Fresh
Small, naturalistic moments like a scene of father and son scrambling to quickly eat breakfast and leave the apartment collectively give the Yiddish-language movie its quiet but unmistakable power.|Fresh
The plot is a touch obvious, but Menashe still plays like a more culturally specific Kramer vs. Kramer, setting up a testy, fascinating dynamic between micromanaging rabbis and a naturally warm dad with wisdom of his own.|Fresh
Bittersweet yet charming, it's both intimate and relatable for parents everywhere.|Fresh
This is not a melodramatic movie - there's not so much as a fistfight, and the ending will be too quiet for some - yet at times its sadness is almost overwhelming.|Fresh
Menashe is full of lovely grace notes in which nothing much happens, but which deepen our understanding of this self-segregated corner of the world.|Fresh
"My heart broke a little near the end of ""Menashe,"" a sweet comedy that's not without a bit of sadness. For sure, this funny and tender film prompts cheerful smiles, but sometimes they turn melancholy."|Fresh
The film ends up getting stuck in a no man's land between fiction and documentary, never quite coming together as a complete narrative.|Rotten
It's a gentle, melancholy father-and-son story that's as notable for an evocation of its self-contained world as it is for its drama.|Fresh
Weinstein has created a work of interest partially because he is aware of his own distance from his subject matter.|Fresh
The film has an unpolished intimacy, peeling back the surface exoticism of a cloistered faith to reveal the poignantly ordinary struggle of being an imperfect person in the world.|Fresh
What keeps Menashe from just being outside-in ethnography is how much nuance Weinstein and Lustig bring to the main character.|Fresh
Menashe is a quiet triumph, pulling back when other films would go too far, delivering an engaging drama of intimate detail and considerable humanity.|Fresh
An intimate, affectionate and, to a degree, critical portrayal of both a man and the strict traditions he's raised in.|Fresh
A stunning achievement in every sense. The film stands on its own as family drama but beyond that is a profoundly sensitive look at an orthodox society that is facing challenges from within.|Fresh
Director Weinstein evokesthe warmth of Brooklyn's Hasidic community while at the same time offering implicit criticism of its insularity.|Fresh
Menashe humanizes Hasidic life In a pensive, emotional drama.|Fresh
Invites audiences into the insular world of Hasidic New York via a character they won't soon forget, memorably embodied by first-timer Menashe Lustig.|Fresh
The film winds up compelling both from a cultural and sociological angle and as a universal story of a parent yearning to be with his son.|Fresh
Rather than pick apart rituals... Weinstein simply lets us see them in action as part of the natural fabric of Menashe's life.|Fresh
Striking throughout are the seemingly caught-on-the-wing moments that subtly enrichen the film's characterizations.|Fresh
'The Three Things That Bring A Man Happiness, Says The Talmud: A nice wife, a nice house, and nice dishes.' And how coming to light, is the way in which forced marriages can psychologically scar males too - who knew. Quirky Un-Orthodox Hasidic tale rules.|Fresh
A gorgeous ode to everyone's inner screw-up.|Fresh

The real strength of Menashe lies with its ability to be a fly on the wall of a fragile existence that can take any number of unexpected turns.|Fresh
Weinstein's charming Menashe immerses us in an authentic environment of ultra-Orthodox Judaism and makes it relatable by weaving a sweet story familiar in its general contours, of a single father struggling to hold onto the son he loves.|Fresh
As if the Dardennes came to Brooklyn, only funnier.|Fresh
