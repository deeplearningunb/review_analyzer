Boyhood spanned everything and nothing in 2014's most joyous examination of the passage of time.|Fresh
[A] soul-bearing, intimate and genuinely uplifting...once-in-a-lifetime coming-of-age film. Epic is an understatement.|Fresh
The filmmakers spent 12 years making it, so it's only fair that you give three hours to experience it.|Fresh
"There is no such thing as ""wasting your life"", because everything in life is worthwhile in its own way, and Boyhood understands this - a quietly poignant message that makes this the best, and most profound, film of the year."|Fresh
Boyhood may be about Mason's life, but it's also telling mine, and perhaps yours too; it may revolve around a boy, but no child, or adult, is excluded.|Fresh
The idea of stepping into someone's life in movies is the root of entertainment and this is as close as it comes. Linklater's exquisite film is a heartbreaker and it's joyous but at its heart it's someone's life in all its aspects.|Fresh
Watching Mason change over the years is gloriously authentic, but most of the change is external; his character never shifts very far from the small boy who liked to stare out the window all day.|Fresh
"Despite its faults, ""Boyhood"" is compelling in a truly authentic way, even if occasionally I felt I was truly living through those 12 years in real time."|Fresh
It shows an already empathetic director at his most humane and, both despite and (mostly) because of its scope, it's a milestone in a career that's usually been a cause for celebration.|Fresh
There are no big speeches or heavy-handed themes in the film -- just the unfolding of a particular life in a particular body, a particular story.|Fresh

I've never seen a film paced quite the same way.|Fresh
The experiment was worth the effort; a magnificent and sublime cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Arquette, in what may be the best performance of her career, conveys exactly what it feels like to be a single parent: the word is trapped.|Fresh
In spite of being presented in an unhurried, episodic manner, you will not find this over two-hour long docu-style indie film sluggish, for it showcases the minutiae of everyday life beautifully.|Fresh
Boyhood is a sublime meditation on childhood, parenting, and the passing of time.|Fresh
"... I found it boring and unengaging, just a collection of ""hey remember when"" moments as opposed to actual introspection and exploration of what it means to grow up."|Rotten
It wasn't necessarily a surprise that Boyhood left me cold-universal praise can be its own warning sign-but considering the rapturous praise it has received from seemingly all corners, it was still a disappointment.|Rotten
Boyhood never allows itself to be trivial - we never see anyone buying groceries, or picking their nose, or spending their days tied to a job they don't enjoy. It's a film that's being celebrated as a triumph of realism, but it isn't like real life at all|Rotten
An audacious effort from a filmmaker whose ability to embed the audience in his stories is unmatched.|Fresh
[Boyhood' is truly a historical moment in cinema.|Fresh
You haven't seen anything like it, and yet often it's like looking in a mirror at your own life.|Fresh
Watching that journey, checking in along the way at what may seem like small and insignificant moments, has a profound cumulative impact.|Fresh
"In an era when life happens quicker than it (used to), ""Boyhood"" offers an oasis of quietude, one that viewers will only enjoy if they are willing to slow down and leave their watches at home."|Fresh
Elegant but a bit meh.|Fresh
Telling the story of a boy from age 6 to 18, and filmed over that same time, it is a beautiful, poetic journey of life, with all of its ups, its downs, and, of course, everything in-between.|Fresh
Criterion showcases Richard Linklater's longitudinal masterwork with a gorgeous HD transfer and an entire second Blu-ray's worth of supplements.|Fresh
In keeping with Linklater's just-do-it aesthetic, the drama is low-key, the dialogue conversational, the observations of human failings and strengths acute without being censorious, the narrative smooth, and the overall vibe easygoing.|Fresh
A film 12 years in the making and worth every minute of the wait.|Fresh
'Boyhood' reveals itself as something deeper, more noteworthy and ambitious than even its remarkable production would suggest, for Linklater has given us nothing less than a cinematic approximation of human memory.|Fresh
'Boyhood' is to coming-of-age movies what 'Act of Valor' is to war movies. 'Valor' used active-duty Navy SEALs, and 'Boyhood' films the same boy over a period of 12 years.|Fresh
Honestly, Boyhood is Richard Linklater's masterpiece and easily the best film of the year so far. Do not miss it.|Fresh
It is sure to be one of the best films of my year.|Fresh
Boyhood is a cinematic achievement. The least we can do is see it and live the experience. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's no hand-holding here on the part of Linklater, who presents these events devoid of theatrics, as true to life as fiction can be.|Fresh
Ambitious and an absolutely excellent endeavor.|Fresh
Intimate and insightful even in its weaker moments, Linklater finds strength and value in normality.|Fresh
Richard Linklater's fascinating look at twelve years in the life of a young boy whose family life is far from perfect. The gimmick seldom feels like one.|Fresh
In the end the story just did not amount to much.|Fresh
... a different and daring kind of cinematic experience, something rare enough in American popular cinema.|Fresh
Sorry I'm a party pooper for a film most think is super.|Rotten
Time and change are the universal themes here, embodied and particularised in Linklater's dramatic study of a divided and mildly dysfunctional family... This is one for the (and all) ages.|Fresh
A period film shot in the present, Boyhood also provides us with vivid cultural snapshots from the recent past - including queuing in robes for the latest Harry Potter novel and Obama's 2008 election campaign.|Fresh
This is not only a great film, but an important landmark in how great films can be made.|Fresh
Boyhood: Concept: A Execution: C --|Rotten
We can't help feeling inexorably attuned to these people ... as if the idea of sitting down to dinner with them is not only possible, but de facto.|Fresh
Probably one of the most unusual coming of age films you'll ever hope to see.|Fresh
Boyhood is dizzying and dazzling, messy and mesmerizing, an ambitious and singular movie that grapples with towering questions about life itself - and finds profundity in how it not fails but refuses to provide all the answers.|Fresh
Boyhood, which started filming in 2002 and continued off and on for twelve years, is the greatest coming-of-age story ever put to film.|Fresh
There's not a great theme, a great performance or even a great scene in Boyhood. But I think it might be a great picture.|Fresh
As is Linklater's custom, Boyhood is profound in such a casual way that its weighty themes feel nonchalant, effortless. This movie might make you cry for reasons you can't quite articulate. You won't be alone in feeling that way.|Fresh
Cinema has always been the best place for time travel, but rarely has it been so anchored in reality than in Richard Linklater's Boyhood.|Fresh
It's a simultaneously modest and massively ambitious undertaking, so original in its conception and so successful in its execution that it deserves to be remembered as a landmark achievement.|Fresh
Linklater bridges the gap between these more art-oriented projects and contemporary narrative cinema. He offers us a new sense of knowing time by inviting us to be present as it unfurls.|Fresh
The sweetly appealing Coltrane shoots up before our eyes and doesn't buckle under the scrutiny, but if Mason is our ostensible focus then his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) is the movie's unsung heroine.|Fresh
Linklater here is full of optimism, as always, but he remains a doggedly unsentimental realist.|Fresh
It is interesting even when nothing much happens, which is for most of its 3-hour running time.|Fresh
It's an ambitious experiment that paid off big-time, both for Linklater and his audience. I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like it.|Fresh
Arquette in particular unearths meaty pockets of raw emotion along her character's journey through a performance that reminds us of her immense talent.|Fresh
Linklater took a risk on an ambitious way to relate an oft-told tale, and in his newcomer lead and career-best turns from Arquette and Hawke, he succeeds.|Fresh
It's an honorable and obviously artistically successful project, my personal quibbles notwithstanding.|Fresh
A fiction film version of Michael Apted's landmark 7 Up series, writer/director Richard Linklater's Boyhood is one of the best films he has ever made -- a linear, at times surprisingly poetic portrait of a modern American childhood.|Fresh
One of the loveliest things about Boyhood is how much of it makes those long-forgotten strings of childhood vibrate within you. It reminds you of what it was like to be a kid.|Fresh
"The ambition at play here even makes Linklater's fantastic ""Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight"" series pale in comparison."|Fresh
Its complete submission to those nothings, mediums, beautiful portraits of life's fabric is what makes Boyhood unprecedented.|Fresh
This is the best American movie I've seen in years -- and one of the very best movies about America ever made.|Fresh
Like other Linklater films, Boyhood is sunny and optimistic but not without its rocky moments, driven by dialogue that's often funny and insightful but always natural.|Fresh
Boyhood is a quiet marvel that follows its characters with a fondness that builds and a necessary distance that aches in its verisimilitude.|Fresh
A seemingly limitless stream of pure empathy runs through Richard Linklater's transcendental movie event/social experiment/life-affirming headtrip Boyhood.|Fresh
It's a journey, seldom seen on film, that will fascinate and move you with every step.|Fresh
Linklater's casual hand at storytelling, dealing out reel after reel of naggingly forthright enlightenment, turns this simple tale of a mother trying to do her best into something worth every second of the time it took to produce.|Fresh
This is one experimental film that is a total success.|Fresh
Richard Linklater's Boyhood is in most respects a traditional realist film -- plainly shot, devoid of plot gimmicks, aiming to approximate life as it is actually lived.|Fresh
The film is at once of a piece with Linklater's other pictures -- as temporal as the Before/After series, as philosophical as Waking Life -- and also more universal than anything else he's done.|Fresh
It's a film you can't stop watching. Until it ends. And even then you wish Boyhood was only the beginning of an extraordinary work in progress.|Fresh
These moments are almost cliches, but only because so many of us have lived these scenes in the course of our own lives, and that's what makes them so powerful.|Fresh
Watching the film, I wasn't exactly as moved as I'd hoped I would be, and that was at first disappointing. But then I remembered that Richard Linklater doesn't really do big emotional indicating, that you have to listen a little closer.|Fresh
At its heart, though, Boyhood is less about boyhood than parenthood. Much of the viewer's empathy lies with Patricia Arquette, who plays a mother struggling to raise two kids mostly on her own, with the occasional incursions of men.|Fresh
Maybe only Linklater could do a radical narrative experiment that's also just another low-key slice of life. Obviously, Boyhood required rigorous control, but never does it give off a sense of the filmmaker clutching it too tightly.|Fresh
By all means, enjoy this movie for its evocation of childhood, but let's also appreciate how Linklater calls for us to reimagine how we might treat movies and childhood: less judgment, less organization, more daydreaming.|Fresh
Boyhood is proof that a strange magic can still bloom amidst the tragedy that buffets human life.|Fresh
"It's the casual ease of ""Boyhood's"" construction, its lack of a specifically lofty artistic objective, that makes it so effective."|Fresh
I kept wondering what I was supposed to be enjoying about this film and I'm still wondering.|Rotten
Boyhood is as immersive as it is observational, and at the same time inescapably self-reflective. In terms of manipulating the relationship between viewer and screen, there is nothing quite like it.|Fresh
"It's the gimmick film to end all gimmick films. It's Linklater on a bike, holding his breath, crossing his eyes, puffing out his cheeks, going full speed at that ramp yelling, ""Look, Ma! No hands!"""|Fresh
Linklater's filmmaking here is groundbreaking.... but in terms of thematic originality it can't hold a candle to some of the other films from his incredibly diverse canon.|Fresh
"To call this drama ""audacious"" is an understatement. It's a downright masterpiece and a film that will be studied and celebrated in the years to come."|Fresh
Less of a movie and more of an experiment. Arguably, an experiment that ultimately works. But I would never sit through it again.|Fresh
A truly groundbreaking experience and a standout film of this or any year fully deserving the tag of a modern classic.|Fresh
If you support your family picking lettuce, your life is more interesting than Linklater's family.|Rotten
A one-off masterpiece, the likes of which has never been done before, and will never be done again.|Fresh
An amazing, time-capsule-worthy portrait of boyhood|Fresh
Linklater's bold experiment pays off|Fresh
Um road movie no qual a estrada  o tempo.|Fresh
What Boyhood lacks in terms of story development and pace, this inevitably flawed but compelling experiment compensates by showing its central cast experiencing real life and growing considerably older without the need for special effects and prosthetics.|Fresh
It may be two and a half hours, and it may avoid the normal conventions of plot, but it has a weight and substance that feels like nothing else ... a truly singular movie-going experience.|Fresh
The real reason for this film's high level of realism and drama is its screenplay (this film is written and directed by Richard Linklater) which is refreshingly adult, realistic, dramatic and reflective of today's society.|Fresh
So much could have gone wrong over the years, it's insane that any filmmaker would have tried this. But if anyone could pull it off, it would be Linklater.|Fresh
This is an intimate, poignant film that makes you feel a little sad. But there are lots of loving and funny moments - such as when Mason and his kids campaign for Barack Obama - and the overall effect is life-affirming.|Fresh
"It's a slow-burn drama that works well over its epic length, exploring the nuances of those around Mason rather than lurching for the dramatic spikes and revelations we normally associate with the mislabelled ""coming-of-age"" sub-genre of teen films."|Fresh
The effect is uncanny and heartbreaking, yet exhilarating, not depressing. Mom sums it up, when Mason celebrates his 15th birthday: 'I'm so glad you were born.' We'd like to think she's speaking to all of us.|Fresh
But the film's best bits don't give us nearly enough to justify those accolades or dispel the feeling that you're being taken on a leisurely meander through lives short on surprises and revelations.|Fresh
Boyhood is an observant and sometimes profound marriage between fiction and reality.|Fresh
I became so interested, so invested in these characters that I kind of wished they were real. I wanted to know more. I wanted to be able to follow them after the final scene.|Fresh
both rewards and challenges our expectations of a coming-of-age narrative, delivering a portrait of growing up that is both poignant and poetic|Fresh
Not a single line feels like a written joke, although the film is entirely scripted, and all of the humour feels observed rather than created. It is a technically astonishing, completely written fiction that feels like real life.|Fresh
An indie film epic the likes of which have never been seen before. And yet, as with Before Midnight, it's the project's emotional authenticity that ensures that it really hits home.|Fresh
This heartwarming and complexly layered drama isn't just one of the best films of the year, but one of the best of the decade, the kind of deeply touching experience that feels like a one-off.|Fresh
Linklater casts a spell that defies you to not be moved, and captures the incredible complexity, richness and emotion of every one of our unique lives in the process.|Fresh
The result is it's a wonderful story.|Fresh
It's an extraordinary achievement marked by simply wonderful performances.|Fresh
While it is really an exploration of 12 mundane years in the life of a fairly ordinary American family, it is never boring and rarely makes you think that anything that happens was forced.|Fresh
One of the most emotionally powerful films of this or any other year.|Fresh
Recommending a movie without a plot sounds ludicrous. That is, unless the movie is 'Boyhood' and the movie was written and directed by Richard Linklater, whose 'Before Sunrise,' 'Before Sunset' and 'Before Midnight' are beloved by so many film-goers.|Fresh
"""Boyhood"" a subtle, powerful meditation on life."|Fresh
One of the great films of modern times.|Fresh
There is something quite extraordinary about Richard Linklater's film as it depicts a fictional representation about growing up, family, relationships and life's choices - using real time as its bookmark and calling card.|Fresh
A wondrous exhibition of the intangibles that make a film great: tone, pacing, authenticity, subtext. But it's most masterful at capturing the bittersweet passage of time.|Fresh
Watching the film is less a matter of observing characters than spending time with friends.|Fresh
Cinematic poetry...As that greatest of screen rarities—a potentially mainstream experimental film—the writer-director earns a bit of slack in gratitude for the strange and wonderful gift Boyhood is...|Fresh
For all of its contained and implied profundities, Boyhood succeeds in large part thanks to a virtually unnoticeable sleight of hand.|Fresh
This film hits you in personal ways that have more to do with your identity and memory than with the film itself.|Fresh
An exceptionally well-crafted coming-of-age story.|Fresh
"Too realistic to be inspirational but too genuine to fault, ""Boyhood"" is, against all odds, a cohesive cinematic feat not likely to be matched any time soon."|Fresh
Adjectives really don't do this one justice. Richard Linklater's 12-year project is brilliant. And bold. And innovative. And not to be missed.|Fresh
Watching these characters orbit in and out of one another's lives gives a sense of actually watching people -- not canned archetypes, but fully formed people -- get older.|Fresh
Both a conceptual tour de force and a fragile, unassuming slice of movie life.|Fresh
A masterpiece of independent filmmaking, Boyhood is nothing short of an emotional epic, one that is relatable and moving and entirely unforgettable.|Fresh
Linklater strings these ordinary moments together like Christmas lights to make an entrancing portrait of life.|Fresh
It's not every day you see something you don't see every day. The day you experience Linklater's remarkable new work, I guarantee, will be one you won't soon forget. It's perhaps the most artful and audacious experiment in the history of film.|Fresh
"A work that easily breaks free of the shackles of ""just a gimmick"" and emerges as a superb motion picture in its own right."|Fresh
Linklater sculpts drama out of time, demonstrating that the fleeting moments we experience day in and day out are actually telling the story of our lives.|Fresh
Once again, Linklater achieves that easy-going, seat-of-the-pants realism.|Fresh
It truly is an epic account of anyone's/everyone's simple life story.|Fresh
Despite the wrinkles in Linklater's time tapestry, he has given us one of the most memorable movies of the year, and probably his own masterpiece.|Fresh
It's one of those offerings that grows on you the more you think about it long after walking out of the theater. (Full Content Review for Parents also Available)|Fresh
Captures the bittersweet, sublimely humdrum process of growing up in a way that no other single movie has done.|Fresh
[Boyhood] plays like a lyrical series of snapshots, capturing the kind of shared moments in time that seem to resurface almost randomly in our memories.|Fresh
The closest thing to a lived life that fictional cinema has yet produced.|Fresh
The film takes the audience on a visceral trip back to childhood partly because it shows a real child mature on screen. What completes the effect, though, is masterful writing and directing, by Linklater, and editing, by Sandra Adair.|Fresh
A portrait of the process of becoming who we are, and the people and events that pingpong across our path during it.|Fresh
Linklater has crafted what may be the most ingenious film of the century here and given it a tone like no other ...|Fresh

Linklater uses life itself to his advantage by finding a clever way to capture its scope.|Fresh
Revolutionary in its approach and quietly transformational in the way of all great art; experiencing it will change you.|Fresh

The year's most captivating narrative experiment, and possibly the most engrossing coming-of-age movie in the history of the genre.|Fresh
Boyhood understands the tumult of childhood and adolescence as well as it does the hurdles and satisfaction of raising children.|Fresh
Richard Linklater's latest feels more like living a life than watching a movie. It's a one-of-a-kind experience.|Fresh
"Boyhood proves we're never the same people that we were when we were children. And it also proves what the old people always sighed about: ""They grow up so fast."""|Fresh
"Terms like ""epic,"" ""ambitious,"" ""one-of-a-kind"" and ""career-capping"" normally sound pretentious. Not here- this is a special, special film"|Fresh
Boyhood is the closest we've ever come to narrative cinma-vrit -- and the results are just a little mind-altering.|Fresh
Thanks to the astonishing consistency of Linklater and the cast, and the faultless editing of Sandra Adair, all this happens in Boyhood much as it would in reality, as a continual unfolding, without on-screen titles or chapter breaks.|Fresh
Far from a handicap, the film's disjointed narrative elements become its greatest strength, showing that life's -- and especially, childhood's -- grand plot points never fall where we expect, and are often the result of elements beyond our control.|Fresh
Richard Linklater's naturalistic, bittersweet, coming-of-age alternative to studio productions.|Fresh
Any film that takes twelve years to shoot should be commended for its stamina alone; yet no sense of grind, still less of fatigue, attends this Richard Linklater project.|Fresh
I can't help but think there may have been a better movie still lurking in his accumulated footage, one that with a mild shift in emphasis might have been titled, more ambitiously, Adulthood.|Fresh
Director Richard Linklater accomplished something truly visionary with Boyhood. It's nearly three hours long, but it moves by nearly as quickly as life does.|Fresh
...a truly memorable and singular cinematic experience that's well worth the wait.|Fresh
Rich in charm, meaning and heart, it stealthy worms its way into your being, triggering your own recall button on how growing up would be so much easier if adults would stop getting in the way.|Fresh
As genuine as Boyhood feels, it falls short of really flooring you with greatness. So many life lessons seem to fall on deaf ears without more conflict or bad luck being thrown in along the way.|Fresh
[Richard Linklater's] magnum opus is at once intimate and epic.|Fresh
Boyhood is a coming-of-age film not quite like any other.|Fresh
It really is a movie unlike any other.|Fresh
Few filmmakers ever make a great movie. Fewer still ever make a movie that expands what movies can express. Richard Linklater does both with Boyhood.|Fresh

Those who bemoan cinema circa 2014 for being out of ideas: prepare to meet your match.|Fresh
It's a bit of a gimmick movie, sure, but it's a brilliant gimmick. A coming-of-age movie where the characters actually come of age, imagine that.|Fresh
So, while it's tempting to say that nothing happens in Boyhood, that would be wrong. What happens is everything.|Fresh
"""Boyhood"" is a stunt, an epic, a home video, and a benediction. It reminds us of what movies could be and - far more important - what life actually is."|Fresh
A soulful movie about soulful people. You just can't help but fall in love with it.|Fresh
To say Boyhood wouldn't be that special if it were shot in a conventional manner is kind of like saying that elephant in the zoo wouldn't be so big if it weren't so big.|Fresh

...chronicles the colossal significance of the everyday.|Fresh
It's easy to watch the film and recall similar moments in your own life. That's not enough; the film needs to inspire reflection, not just recollection.|Rotten
"""Boyhood"" is a cinematic gift, a compassionate and sometimes amusing drama about growing up that extracts truths out of what appear to be life's most random moments."|Fresh

A stunning and mind-blowing testament to the relentless passage of time.|Fresh

One of the most remarkable moviegoing experiences I've ever had.|Fresh
Linklater and his team have done something incredibly difficult and made it look effortless. The result is easily one of the best films of the year.|Fresh

"It's an acheivement unlike anything I've seen before, so I gotta go big: 5/5 Schmoes for ""Boyhood"". To paraphrase another Linklater film...your first priority of the summer should be to see this movie. (Then lay back and crank some Foghat.)"|Fresh
Filmmaker Richard Linklater has long since earned his reputation as an original thinker but his latest work, 'Boyhood,' is in a class by itself.|Fresh
Wobbly at times but still magical in an everyday way...|Fresh
Film, by its very nature, is meant to capture nuggets of time, but Boyhood is all forward momentum and growth. The weight it attains in its last hour is no accident. It's the weight of existence itself.|Fresh
Boyhood is an epic masterpiece that seems wholly unconcerned with trying to be one.|Fresh
These are people you know, maybe people like you.|Fresh
"On rare occasions a movie seems to channel the flow of real life. ""Boyhood"" is one of those occasions."|Fresh
The film is lengthy -- almost three hours -- and without much plot, but I sat rapt for every minute.|Fresh
It is difficult to imagine after this movie how any film-maker can resort to the conventions of multi-decade storytelling -- ageing make-up, dusty wigs -- without appearing unforgivably lazy.|Fresh
This is a film that's as epic as it is minutely domestic, and reminds us that the banality of the everyday is what makes a life. How it can remind us of this, without being banal itself? Exactly. That is its phenomenal achievement.|Fresh
"""Boyhood"" is a transporting experience about the simplest of subjects. The movie telescopes artfully - but never pretentiously - the experience of growing up."|Fresh
Boyhood shimmers with unforced reality. It shows how an ordinary life can be reflected in an extraordinary movie.|Fresh
A whisper short of three hours, the film and its plot are so lithe yet robust you can hang anything on them.|Fresh
It's an astonishing achievement.|Fresh
It's a collage of ordinary fragments that, in the end, add up to a greater whole.|Fresh
Rarely has anything like this been attempted in cinema, with a filmmaker intentionally setting out to watch a young person grow up on screen.|Fresh
...by the end you'll feel like this massive time capsule was just injected into your soul.|Fresh
A film that I love more than I can say. And there is hardly a better, or nobler thing a film can do than inspire love.|Fresh
A unique and quite wonderful cinematic experiment which somehow manages to capture the intangible essence of life, in all its sound and fury, perhaps better than any film in recent memory.|Fresh
Looking back on his accomplishments to date, it becomes clear that Linklater is one of the grand pioneers, explorers, and expanders of contemporary cinema.|Fresh
There's never been a movie quite like Boyhood, and it may be years before anyone works up the gumption to match its achievement.|Fresh
I can think of few feature films in the history of the medium that have explored the power, and the melancholy, of film's intimate enmeshment with time in the way Richard Linklater's Boyhood does.|Fresh
A heady film experience packed with so many telling details about life in the United States over the past 12 years - and one that makes you care such much about the struggles and foibles of its imperfect characters.|Fresh
There's not a parent alive who will be able to shake the haunting beauty of Linklater's latest film, a flawed but vibrant masterpiece...|Fresh
Linklater's Boyhood is a must-see film for any lover of the movies. It's the type of film that was imagined when they invented film.|Fresh
Richard Linklater's coming-of-age tale is the best movie of the year, a four-star game-changer that earns its place in the cultural time capsule.|Fresh
An intimate epic as fresh and thrillingly alive as Francois Truffaut's films of Antoine Doinel, who was wrought in five movies beginning with The 400 Blows. Boyhood is but one movie, and it's just as subversive.|Fresh
The movie isn't as Here Comes the Big Cry as the trailer and the concept would make you think; it's far too smart and wise for that. Yet I still bet it makes you bawl your head off.|Fresh
By the end so much has changed - a whole life seem to have been lived, and yet there's still so much left.|Fresh
Could reveal itself as Linklater's defining cinematic statement.|Fresh
Touching, funny, big-hearted and recklessly ambitious.|Fresh
A quiet stunner of a movie that yields to time rather than try to bend it to its will.|Fresh
An authentically awkward, ordinary life, scrupulously observed.|Fresh
If I have any quibble at all with Richard Linklatter's glorious film, it's the title. Because while the ambitious concept is to follow one boyhood, the movie is just as much about a family and about America.|Fresh
Believe the hype: Richard Linklater's decade-in-the-making epic is a remarkable achievement.|Fresh
With a brilliant filmmaking experiment that works beyond belief, Linklater continues to prove himself as one of the strongest character-driven filmmakers out there.|Fresh
Not just a great stunt, but a deep and moving portrait of childhood, family, and growing up. The best picture of the summer|Fresh
As he has throughout his career, Linklater proves himself as a filmmaker unconcerned with flash and dazzle but thoroughly compassionate and empathetic to a wide range of characters.|Fresh
Clocking in at close to three hours, Boyhood overstays its welcome a little; but strong performances, an evocative soundtrack together with the director's flair for off-the-cuff profundity ensure that fans of quality movie-making won't be disappointed.|Fresh
"If there was ever project that demanded to be informed by the history of its making, ""Boyhood"" is it. Epic in scope yet unassuming throughout, Linklater's incredibly involving chronicle marks an unprecedented achievement in fictional storytelling"|Fresh
There's a universal appeal here that'll resonate whether you're a son, daughter, father, mother or sibling. Simply put, Boyhood is a masterpiece.|Fresh
Given the fractured nature of the shoot, the film is remarkably fluent, and fortunate that young Ellar Coltrane is mostly an intriguing focus.|Fresh
Linklater's beautiful film is an extraordinary achievement - tender, funny, wise and wistful, full of warmth and humanity.|Fresh
One of the best and most memorable films ever made about the art of improvisation as a path of wisdom, creativity, and personal renewal.|Fresh
An absolutely brilliant film about the stuff of day-to-day life.|Fresh
Director Richard Linklater approached this decade-spanning project with a novelist's ambition and patient determination -- it's unique in its rhythms.|Fresh
Boyhood is an oversized and sprawling smorgasbord of a movie, blending the beautiful with the irritating in a rich and messy tapestry of growing pains and pubescent grumbling.|Fresh
Richard Linklater's film is an experiment in time, and one that's attentive to the audience's sense of empathy.|Fresh
"Boyhood is not only a masterful film but a culturally rich one as well, a cinematic equivalent to the Mark Twain coming of age classic ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" yet made for a new generation."|Fresh
It just moves so quickly, which, I suppose, is the whole point. For those of us who were already marking time by tracking Ethan Hawke's facial hair, it'll be a startling experience.|Fresh
Boyhood is a one of a kind experience.|Fresh
For as down to earth as the material is, Linklater elevates it into something important, making a study of not only childhood and human development, but the rigors and vicissitudes of adulthood.|Fresh
It's a Linklater picture all around, treating an impossible cinematic mission with all the urgency of a leisurely conversation. Boyhood sinks in slowly instead of demanding attention.|Fresh
Boyhood is the summation of Richard Linklater's entire career...A moving and masterful evocation of what it means to be a family, and all the hurt and hope that comes with it.|Fresh
From the moment a train pulled into a station filmmakers have been trying to present life to us -- to tell us its story -- and Linklater may have now come the closest.|Fresh
A quite remarkable piece of cinema.|Fresh
This is a movie where not much happens that probably hasn't happened to you, but which, in the aggregation of these moments, becomes something utterly profound.|Fresh
Boyhood truly is a film about the human experience, and this is something everybody can relate to.|Fresh
Captured in vivid images and told in Linklater's typically astute, observational style similar to his 'Before' movies, perhaps the greatest achievement is how natural it all flows together given the fractured manner in which the film was constructed.|Fresh
Linklater's third masterpiece in the past decade should only affect anyone who's ever been someone else's sibling, child, parent, lover or friend.|Fresh
It seems appropriate that Boyhood was always in the background, charting its filmmaker's growth from Tape to Before Midnight. As Mason grew, so did the man who kept returning to his story.|Fresh
And there's a sadness in that you just don't want Boyhood to end, with the film a remarkable accomplishment that won't be forgotten anytime soon.|Fresh

What an astonishing achievement; what a beautiful movie.|Fresh
"There's a rough-edged, organic quality to ""Boyhood"" that recalls the work of those European helmers Linklater so admires: Fassbinder, Bergman, Bresson."|Fresh
The film has that deadpan Linklater tone of slacker haphazardness, but you could also say that it's almost Joycean in its appreciation of the scruffy magic of everyday life.|Fresh
Boyhood is a narrative drama, but it unfolds like documentary truth.|Fresh
Not just a coming-of-age movie, but the definitive coming-of-age movie ...|Fresh
Richard Linklater's latest is an impressive feat of filmmaking even before you consider the narrative. That the 164-minute runtime rarely feels sluggish or padded is also a major achievement.|Fresh
Unshakable, witty and deeply felt, the film will be paying emotional dividends for a long, long time.|Fresh
