Cold War contemplates how personal lives are swept up in the tsunami of greater political forces. The result feels even more heartfelt, and for good reason.|Fresh
There have been a lot of films about singers this year. This one, a Red Star Is Born, counters them by rejecting notions of success from our side of the Iron Curtain.|Fresh

Patronizes European modernity and turns it into soft-core kitsch.|Rotten
So much passion and fire, and yet so much coldness. Joanna Kulig is a revelation. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Between a sobering score and haunting settings, Pawlikowski has created the perfect backdrop for a maudlin postmortem contemplating the fate of a couple of star-crossed lovers.|Fresh
This is a rare film in which everything gels so perfectly, the whole would collapse if one element were missing.|Fresh
"Pawlikowski renders all this in the same kind of gorgeous black and white that he used in his 2013 film ""Ida."""|Fresh
A mesmerizing performance from Joanna Kulig and beautiful cinematography by Lukasz Zal could not overcome the repugnant nature of a love story centered on a young girl, abused by her father, then controlled and sexualized by her teacher.|Rotten
Rarely has a heartfelt film seemed so chilly.|Fresh
The film is gorgeous, and [director Pawel] Pawlikowski creates a bleak atmosphere that injects itself into each pristine frame.|Fresh
There's much to admire about Cold War , a Best Foreign Film nominee for this year's Academy Award.|Fresh
If all of Hollywood is a form of melodrama, here is its opposite - understated drama that pulls between poignancy and, via its music, a more full-blooded life spirit.|Fresh
Cold War is an immaculately crafted film shot in exquisite black and white and marvelously acted - especially by its incandescent lead actress Joanna Kulig, whose mercurial performance recalls Jeanne Moreau.|Fresh
At a crisp 88 minutes, it's the tightest historical and romantic epic one is likely to see for a long time.|Fresh
Sometimes love is a battlefield. Cold War may leave you feeling like collateral damage.|Rotten
"""Doctor Zhivago Lite."""|Fresh
The brisk pace and short run-time of Cold War add to the fleeting nature of the love story at its center, and each scene feels necessary.|Fresh
What makes the film really tick is the two leads - with Kot and Kulig's on screen chemistry feeling almost effortless. The two actors really make you care about the characters and their plights -- furthering the intimate feel of the material.|Fresh
Amazingly, Pawlikowski gets there and back in less than 90 minutes by letting us fill in huge time gaps that might take us to even more intriguing places if we legitimately think about it. This seriously is some good, spare stuff.|Fresh
"Like the great old movie romances, ""Cold War"" packs a full range of emotions into its narrow frame."|Fresh
Since the subtitles are few, fragmented and far-between, for non-linguists, it's frigid and forlorn, evoking a bleak melancholy.|Rotten
"It may be a ""Cold War,"" but the actors' chemistry burns through the screen."|Fresh
A cold, passionless, underwritten tale of a relationship wrecked by circumstance.|Rotten
The best foreign language film of the year, Cold War is a gorgeously sad romance that will leave your heart quaking.|Fresh
It's a lot of thematic ground to cover, but it's all conveyed effortlessly in this poignant, poetic film that is never heavy or didactic despite its weighty subjects.|Fresh
Throughout, though, the tone remains melancholy - and not simply because the film was shot in black and white. An unhappy pall hangs over the movie, keeping the lovers from basking in true happiness.|Fresh
Set against shifting political and musical environments and spanning at least four countries and 15 years, Pawel Pawlikowski's Cold War is a gorgeous and mournful ode to star-crossed lovers that feels equally sweeping and intimate.|Fresh
Brief nudity, language in romantic, mature Polish drama.|Fresh
An astute, aggressive inquisition of art as a bureaucratic cudgel gives way to boringly doomed romance -doled out in webisode-sized chunks. Cold War is a gorgeous film to gaze upon, but it's ultimately eye-catching jetsam floating downstream.|Rotten
What was a document of love enduring against all odds becomes one of love's corruptibility. [Pawlikowski has] delivered an exposé on love's power to blind us to everything.|Fresh
Ms. Kulig's smoldering performance is worth the price of admission in itself. She's clearly channeling Lauren Bacall's laconic-sardonic delivery throughout.|Fresh
An artisan masterpiece that reconciles the brevity of haiku with the immensity of a Russian novel. Cold War hits with the strength of an instant classic. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Its Polish folk dancers are a joy to watch.|Fresh
This unconventional love story captivates audiences with its nearly square frame and conflicted romance that is amazingly contained to less than 90 minutes without missing a beat or feeling rushed.|Fresh
A brilliantly melancholy portrayal of two people who can't resist one another but are doomed to destroy their chance of enduring happiness, as well as the oppressive system they're trapped in.|Fresh
Pawlowski's masterful and psychologically rich film has its fun moments, but they too, are under a dark cloud. It reflects on the cruelty of European prejudices and nationalism during that period in one of the saddest films in recent memory.|Fresh
The movie deftly weaves together the personal and the political.|Fresh
It's gorgeous to look at and, honestly, quite compelling from beginning to end. I just wish I felt more of the love.|Fresh
Cold War is filled with remarkably staged scenes that linger in the viewer's consciousness for days.|Fresh

The most ravishing tone poem since Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love.|Fresh
A sweet romance this isn't, but Pawlikowski (Ida) balances the flatfooted realities of maddeningly thwarted love with swoony moments: smoky jazz clubs and songbird reveries.|Fresh
Pawel Pawlikowski's timeless love story seduces the viewer with the perfect blend of romance, tragedy, and music. Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot are fantastic.|Fresh
This is about as far from Hollywood as one can get and still be in love in every frame.|Fresh
The luminous black-and-white musical melodrama is the kind Hollywood used to make, about an attractive couple who sing and fight and love together. Through this lens, it's a kind of romantic protest against a political nightmare.|Fresh
Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski's Cold War is a stunning piece of episodic storytelling that's positively breathtaking in its invigorating emotional magnitude.|Fresh
A filmmaking marvel that yields the perfect blend of artistry and passion.|Fresh
Much like Ida, the film is shot in gorgeous black & white by cinematographer Lukasz Zal, giving the feel you're watching some piece of history passed on across generations.|Fresh
Poland has seen more than its share of war, and of the art and cinema of exile. Pawel Pawlikowski's latest feature, Cold War, is a spirited albeit flawed entry in this category.|Fresh
Filled with music from many genres, from folk to jazz to rock and roll, Pawel Pawlikowski's Cold War is a sumptuous, sad, and often thrilling story of love set mostly in post-war Poland.|Fresh
When together, they are madly in love, fight a lot, and make beautiful jazz. The film has a perfect ending.|Fresh
Slightly cold to the touch...Cold War is a visually striking black-and-white musical drama, beautifully shot by cinematographer Łukasz Żal.|Fresh
Complex, lushly black-and-white love story may be Oscar foreign language front runner.|Fresh
A marvel of concision. The story skips like a stone across time, to devastating effect.|Fresh
It's as verbally spare as it is visually spellbinding.|Fresh
If Kulig, who resembles Jessica Chastain, were American, Hollywood would be offering her everything.|Fresh
Along with the off-center black-and-white cinematography, Pawlikoski's most effective tool here is the way music provides the pulse of the story.|Fresh
Cold War is a concise and dry and amusingly romantic tale that takes its storytelling to a daringly elliptical fashion and it thankfully pays off, as it convincingly shows how fleeting memories of love can be and yet can stand the test of time.|Fresh
Cold War is also about art itself, and the conditions necessary for its creation. Art is always a balance of freedom and constraint, and these two artists find their balance differently...|Fresh
This picture feels like a film out of time, shot in glorious black-and-white with a steady camera and careful compositions.|Fresh
"""Cold War"" suffices as a simple filmic jewel of a story, about a couple swimming hard against the currents of history and governments until they only have each other to cling to."|Fresh
Cold War has the heart of an epic, a smart one, burrowing into its settings, and describing the bitter flavor of two different brands of moral crumble.|Fresh
[Director Pawel] Pawlikowski has the knack of making personal (and political) heartbreak seem, initially, like a joyous European fling.|Fresh
"""Cold War"" is a near-perfect film, an artfully crafted, flawlessly acted meditation on love, memory and invented history that's both deeply personal and politically attuned."|Fresh
Cinematographer Lukasz Zal finds a chilly, etched beauty in every frame; you're struck by how snow seems to stroke and soften a harsh landscape, and by the poignancy of wind ruffling the grass in a quiet field.|Fresh
"Through ""Cold War,"" Pawlikowski shows us the beauty in an ugly time, and then he makes us wait and wonder if the characters will ever see it, too."|Fresh
"""Cold War"" devastates all the same, and its meditations on what might have been and what could never be haunt long after the gutting final frame."|Fresh
The love story between a woman and an older man is one that you've seen many times onscreen before, but there's something about the stark black and white visuals and the sparse narrative that deliver a bittersweet emotional punch.|Fresh
A gorgeous depiction of reckless, headlong, decades-long love... The gorgeous, sweeping story isn't so much elliptical as a succession of sensations, of emotional fragrance told in songs... and shimmering black-and-white images.|Fresh
Cold War is a beautiful showcasing of unbreakable and incomparably dedicated romance capable of strengthening the bond between any couple that watches it|Fresh
Pawlikowski's latest is particularly memorable for its sweeping scope, some heady sensuality and the performances of the broodingly handsome Kot and Kulig, who could use this as a calling-card to hit Hollywood, if she fancies stooping that low.|Fresh
Cold War, like Ida before it, harkens back to midcentury world cinema, resuscitating its distinctly philosophical outlook while remaining current today and likely for decades to come.|Fresh
"Kulig commands the camera, but ""Cold War"" kept me at an emotional distance."|Fresh
It's an understated achievement of great elegance and awareness of the intractable illogic of people. As cinema, it's near perfect, but there's many another schlockier romance that actually makes us care about its lovers.|Fresh
Political freedom, long dreamed of, brings little release.|Fresh
Married with the Academy ratio, the color scheme makes the film feel classic, but Pawlikowski's desire to plumb his past makes it timeless.|Fresh
By downplaying the romance and not accompanying each embrace with a swelling saxophone, Pawlikowski paradoxically makes Cold War even more romantic.|Fresh
It is a lean and perfect gem.|Fresh
A love story that feels strangled by history, a character study and historical tone poem that triumphs on both of those levels.|Fresh
Wrapped in deepest melancholy, Cold War has no idle or frivolous scenes since everything fits and flows under Pawlikowski's masterful direction.|Fresh
Like a song, a relationship can change depending on the context. Pawlikowski approaches this premise and created one of the most personal and masterful films of the year.|Fresh
It's an anthology of disillusions in which love is the only transcendent force.|Fresh
An old-fashioned melodrama -- a good one at that.|Fresh
Much like the folk songs heard throughout the film, Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski's romantic tragedy takes a story of heartbreak and horror and transforms it into something beautiful and timeless.|Fresh
You lap up the images of these beautiful actors, whose textures and feelings are enhanced by the film's overall beauty. And then you wonder if there isn't something missing.|Fresh
Cold War is seductive and yet there is darkness at its heart, one that elevates the Polish film into a thoughtful piece about the complexities of love in a time of political oppression.|Fresh
The small moments linger the most throughout Cold War, and it's in those delicate notes that Pawlikowski's film gains its true resonance.|Fresh
This bittersweet romance is richly textured and quietly powerful.|Fresh
Thunderously dull romantic drama from Paweł Pawlikowski, who won a best foreign film Oscar for 2015's Ida...it's a slog, as well as featuring characters who are hard enough to relate to without Pawlikowski's sterile direction.|Rotten
A film about a doomed romance, Cold War is a haunting portrait of love during wartime, a love that's maybe not meant to be but utterly, cosmically, inescapable.|Fresh
Although it leaves you wanting more, Cold War is a film that is both illuminating and haunting at the same time.|Fresh
Cold War is an unconventional yet deeply moving love story that feels like a modern classic.|Fresh
Cold War is constructed with brief but always telling scenes. It wastes no time, and indeed the running time is shorter than usual. But every moment packs a punch, and every musical cue serves an important purpose.|Fresh
Detente has never been so deadly, nor so perverse.|Fresh
Though 'Cold War' falls far short of its predecessor, it still has enough striking moments to recommend it.|Fresh
It's the love stories like the one inCold War (Zimna wojna) that have the ability to transcend time by offering us the most meaningful impact.|Fresh
Pawlikowksi condenses the entire world into the connection between these two flawed, beautiful people.|Fresh
"Wiktor says that Zula is ""the woman of my life."" He's not lying, and that's what makes this anti-romance ... so mundanely tragic..."|Fresh
This is a masterful, romantic movie filled with stunning imagery, gorgeous use of folk music and jazz and you won't find a false moment in the entire running time. Probably a classic-to-be, certainly first-class moviemaking.|Fresh
"Passionate, tempestuous, haunting and assured, this latest from writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski explores, as did his Oscar-winning ""Ida,"" Poland's recent past, resulting in a potent emotional story with political overtones that plays impeccably today."|Fresh
Cold War is an ode to joylessness that feels historically credible but narratively arbitrary.|Rotten
The film is on a par with that other black-and-white foreign Oscar contender Roma, only more exciting.|Fresh
It's Pawlikowski second-straight masterwork, only one with a critical if seldom-seen error. His movie is too short.|Fresh
Its greatest strengths, though, are its two knockout leads, who give the story its heat, its flesh and its heartbreak.|Fresh
Pawlikowski maintains a high level of energy with frequent music performances, subtle comedy, and a pitch-perfect bittersweet ending.|Fresh
Pawel Pawlikowski's savagely sexy spellbinder burns with a fever that won't quit. Joanna Kulig is a shining new star who rips across the screen like a comet. Forget the frosty title, there's enough sizzling carnality here to the singe the screen.|Fresh
... Cold War is not a typical love story in which its leads are wonderful people triumphing against all odds to prove their love is real. Rather ... Cold War feels more real in its depiction of a hard love set in hard times.|Fresh
Watching the film is a hypnotic experience. Part of that is surely due to the star power of Joanna Kulig, who Pawlikowski gives a luscious showcase to.|Fresh
Cold War resembles a waking dream. And a ravishingly romantic one at that.|Fresh
It's fair to argue that there's more truth in Cold War than in many love stories - that, although a romantic attachment isn't the best basis for a long-term relationship, its power cannot be denied or set aside.|Fresh
An aching film on such exquisite pains of impossible love, Paweł Pawlikowski's Cold War concurrently swells your heart and breaks it.|Fresh
Love is a losing game. But not always. Or maybe always. Watch this audiovisual game of love. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's rare to see a love story built on two such complex individuals, each with their own desires and flaws... They move in tandem, a choreographed dance that brings them together, and pulls them apart, only to jerk back, like magnets.|Fresh
It's a lot of movie, and represents tremendous value if your time is tight. The love story ... is such a good one ... that it verges on the preposterous. It's not. It's based on Pawlikowski's own parents, and that tips it over into the miraculous.|Fresh
This new Pawlikowski films lacks heat... however, it gives us one of the best romances in recent years. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cold War resonates thanks to Joanna Kulig's brilliant performance.|Fresh

Pawel Pawlikowski delivers a beautifully-searing masterpiece.|Fresh

What most engrossed me in Cold War was the framing. The square frame envelops you and focuses your eye more so than even widescreen or IMAX movies often do.|Fresh
In a visually stunning, formally immaculate and darkly romantic film, Pawel Pawlikowski sets a story of star-crossed lovers against the turmoil of post-war Europe.|Fresh
For Wiktor and Zula, their devotion to each other is the one thing in their world not built on sand.|Fresh
Pawlikowski continues to be a master of frame composition. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's got more energy and freedom than the more classically told Ida, and this can be seen in the camera movements, although occasionally it feels like the movie meanders as much as the characters do.|Fresh
Pawlikowski is compelling his two lovers on a sadistic and slightly contrived trajectory to end-gain the moral of the story which is that corrosive politics destroy lives.|Rotten
In Cold War, every frame contains a moving beauty and intensity. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Pawel Pawlikowski puts on stage what is impossible to represent: the space for love in a world divided in two, in this masterful work, powerful and reflective, about passions denied by the historical context. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's sort of Richard Linklater's Before trilogy meets Casablanca, but condensed into an all-too-short 85-minute runtime.|Fresh
The detail is absolutely stunning, there's a searing authenticity to the time period that is undeniably absorbing...However, the almost too tightening restraint forces us to quickly witness its events rather than be moved by them.|Fresh
Pawlikowski knows that we know this story from other movies (A Star is Born, New York New York), so he strips away the externals, and trains his spotlight on the bare basics.|Fresh
The era is set impeccably and the two lead performances are attractive to watch. Eighty-eight minutes roll by and the dirge-like pace zaps the fun and life out of the tale.|Fresh
Never genuinely getting to the root of their love, what the viewer is left with is a yearning for more but wrapped in a riveting performance from Joanna Kulig.|Fresh
Cold War is an imperfect work, evoking a sublime beauty despite its clichés, and cliched despite its sublime beauty.|Rotten
It's as though the scriptwriters already knew the ending ... The result: elliptical and underwritten storytelling.|Rotten
From the musical start, until in one of the most beautiful, romantic and tragic outcomes that I have seen in the cinema, this film is unpredictable, powerful, lyrical, complex and truthful. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The unique find is that relationship between background and form that evokes the commitment of this couple. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Pawlikowski gives us only the bare essentials, making sure they look (and sound) as stunning as possible.|Fresh
Pawel Pawlikowski paints a crude and rough mural in which it is seen, between the winter fog of its separated chapters a love story in which, consequently, we can not intervene ... And it has a reason. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Luminously shot in black and white, with every frame artfully composed, Pawel Pawlikowski's powerful ""Cold War""....casts a spell over audiences."|Fresh
For all the effort on display, it's hard to shake the feeling that this isn't a little too easy for Pawlikowski who... ultimately delivers a desaturated version of The English Patient's more hard-won story of the violence.|Rotten
This is a movie in which the political is personal: what separates Wiktor and Zula is less the Iron Curtain than an intractable cold war of the heart.|Fresh
A passionate love story (yes, there's a recurrent theme here) that plays out, with musical accompaniment and political resonance, across three decades in postwar Europe.|Fresh
Cold War is a self-indulgent and mostly lifeless endeavor that could only exist within the context of a film festival.|Rotten
While it's true that the problems of two little people don't amount to more than a hill of beans in Stalin's USSR, they're real enough to the people experiencing them. We feel for them, even if the world can't.|Fresh
Form and content seem oddly divorced, but music -- the Polish folk tunes, communist-propaganda anthems and Parisian torch songs -- sets the mood and saves the day.|Fresh
For all his allusions to the contrary, [director Pawe] Pawlikowski may be contemporary cinema's foremost metteur en scène.|Fresh
Cold War deserves to be a hit - one of the year's best singles, perhaps, if not an album.|Fresh
If the sudden unresolved ending disappoints it's only because we'd like the whole thing to go on much longer.|Fresh
While one can't reproach Pawlikowski for lacking authenticity, their constant bickering and falling out makes one question whether they should be together at all, with nothing substantial... underpinning their love, just raw erotic energy.|Fresh
Unexpectedly put me in mind of Casablanca or La La Land as reimagined by Andrzej Wajda or Agnieszka Holland - a reminder of the fundamental things that apply, as time goes by.|Fresh
Without any hyperbole, it is one of the films of the year, and possibly of the last decade.|Fresh
This lush throwback to European cinema of the 1950s and 60 looks gorgeous and sounds wonderful, but it never quite gels as the passionate romance it wants to be.|Rotten
The exquisitely-told tale of a decades-long love affair that defies boundaries of class and age, as well as post-war tensions between East and West.|Fresh
All the ingredients are there, but it doesn't quite come together.|Rotten
This is a remarkable achievement - sumptuous, ambitious, intelligent and with a knockout soundtrack.|Fresh
Cold War is 88 minutes of thermal underwear looking for a full outfit of winter ideas.|Rotten
The whole nature of Cold War is one of abbreviation: snappy editing, temporal jumps, deliberately unresolved emotions... This is a film of glancing, heart-crushing pleasures.|Fresh
When the film came to an end, all I wanted was to watch it all over again; Cold War is the first really great film of 2018.|Fresh
At an intense 88 minutes, it's truly all killer, no filler.|Fresh
Pawlikowski is in complete control of the form, but this is no austere piece of work - he even finds time for a few good jokes. Accessible, humane and compassionate: what a treat this is.|Fresh
One of the most colourful things you'll ever see in black and white.|Fresh
Pawlikowski manages another masterful presentation of doomed humans struggling to outrun a past which will not let them go in a film as beautifully packaged as it is performed.|Fresh
[Pawlikowski] has a singular voice all his own, unfurling this story with a lyrical grace that mixes passion, pain and humour with profound political awareness.|Fresh
Full of aching, ecstasy and anger, this is a remarkable and beautiful film about a love that is possible only when it borders on the impossible.|Fresh
It's far from a misfire, but it is a grand epic deserving of a far grander canvas than this.|Fresh
[Director Pawel] Pawlikowski is taciturn, romantic and hopeless in equal parts, he lets himself be carried away by moments of incredible happiness that will be destroyed by the cruel reality of an irrevocable destiny. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a film that understands the intensity and complexity of a true connection as it reverberates through the years.|Fresh
An utterly devastating exploration of love, loyalty, politics and survival.|Fresh
A tableaux of gorgeous idylls alternate with passages of music and dance|Fresh
The ominous figure of socialism chases this love story throughout and is composed with sharp plastic rigor as well as a sensibility akin to the feminine characters of Ingmar Bergman. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cold War rivals most films I can think of in how much longing it packs into every scene... It's a work of unspeakable beauty.|Fresh
This is an achingly personal story - the romantic leads are named after Pawlikowski's own parents, to whom the film is dedicated - and also a sadly resigned one.|Fresh
"Cold War will only increase Pawlikowski's reputation as one of the next great auteurs, but, more importantly, it will have everyone who sees it asking, ""What's that girl's name?"" Ladies and gentlemen, her name is Joanna Kulig has she has arrived."|Fresh
The more we see this relationship, the more its mystery grows. That is the profound, beguiling truth with which Cold War ultimately leaves us.|Fresh
As a romance, Cold War wobbles, but the allegory that the pairing represent is sharply defined and suitably harrowing.|Fresh
It deftly walks the line between appropriately somber and great, sophisticated fun.|Fresh
Pawlikowski gives us a musical romance that works through all the minor keys that matter. Will look and sound well everywhere.|Fresh
A haunted postwar epic in miniature, like a novel written with the careful, precise economy of a short story.|Fresh
The final result is an admirable exercise of narrative economy but also a beautiful love story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a brave thing, to tell a story by omission, but Pawlikowski almost pulls it off.|Fresh
Demonstrates a significant leap in storytelling prowess together with an unerring ability to convey the most revealing character traits with the tiniest of details.|Fresh
Reflecting the two leads, the film retains a quiet humour throughout.|Fresh
In 84 densely packed minutes, the dialogue is often bracingly spare and scenes of sensual pleasure are invariably interrupted, as if cut off by the long arm of cold war communism.|Fresh
Pawlikowski's finest work to date, it's a dexterous examination of two juxtaposed ideologies wrapped in a mesmerising story of wounded love.|Fresh
Shot in ravishing black and white, it offers a stunning marriage of haunting imagery and heartfelt emotion.|Fresh
The film is most exhilarating as a breathless vessel for mood, one that just so happens to conduct itself within reconstructed period settings that are as obsessively detailed as the reverently curated soundtrack.|Fresh
It's visually stunning, passionate, wistful, and thoughtful in equal measure.|Fresh
At its heart there's a relationship that doesn't wholly move you as it needs to do. The rigour of this film-making is nonetheless ravishing.|Fresh
There is an exquisite chill to this film.|Fresh
This film fizzes with a devotional energy and political relevance.|Fresh
Gives us a vision of a Poland in which everyone is a hardened survivor of conflict, where bridges have been crossed and one more betrayal or bargain for self-advancement is just another in a long line of similar events.|Fresh
A soberly moving study of the disappointment and insecurity that can blossom from supposed renewal: It's a romance in which new beginnings and endings can be hard to tell apart.|Fresh
A thrilling exploration of romantic disappointment with a killer soundtrack.|Fresh
Somehow, it's both pristine and jazzy - emotionally aloof by design, but still accessible.|Fresh
