Vital, searing, and engaging.|Fresh

13th is a titanic statement by a major American voice. Viewing - right now - should be mandatory.|Fresh
"DuVernay isn't interested in the impossible, and often absurd, goal of ""balance,"" despite the squirrely presence of Grover Norquist and a lobbyist-apologist; she wants to make you feel something. And she succeeds."|Fresh
Intelligently told, and reflective of Ava DuVernay herself: assured, articulate and bold.|Fresh
As with Selma, filmmaker Ava DuVernay has fashioned a work of pummeling and clear-eyed intelligence.|Fresh
