Director Ava DuVernay has crafted an impressive film that doesn't just chronicle the events in Selma, but serves as an impressive portrait of King both as a leader in the civil rights movement and a flawed family man.|Fresh

Selma rejects... the false ingenuity of the oscarizable biopic, to bet on a polyphonic story, where Dr. King becomes a cohesive element of a series of social agents essential for a change. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Selma is decidedly matter-of-fact and yet it bursts with emotion. When confronted with scenes of shocking brutality, DuVernay knows exactly when to turn the camera away.|Fresh
It seems the reason we haven't yet had a major King biopic is because cinema was waiting for a director to make a film as worthy as the man himself - Ava DuVernay has stepped up to the daunting task and she has succeeded effortlessly.|Fresh

Director Ava DuVernay retains a firm grasp throughout, balancing the epic and intimate, personal and political.|Fresh
America takes another halting step towards confronting its racist past with this solid, if dry, look at a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement.|Fresh
DuVernay and Webb ambitiously dramatize all the intricacies, detours and compromises a wide-scale social justice movement entails, shining stark light on backroom deals, FBI schemes and even rivalries among various pockets of grass-roots rebellion.|Fresh

An urgent, thought-provoking and timely history movingly brought to life.|Fresh
Selma stands as a rigorous film that does justice to the figure of Martin Luther King. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Without being a great movie, Selma is a more than worthy historical product. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Excellent acting, very good directing, a good tight script -- a little bit of pacing issues and... other characters are nowhere near as investing as Martin Luther King is.|Fresh
Selma convinces that this is a tale of transcendence instead of hardship; triumph rather than defeat. And it's a story whose resonance is ever so desperately needed in the pervasive now.|Fresh
DuVernay's film is too effective on its own dramatic terms for it to be reduced simply to an allegory for Where We Are Today, yet it's also tremendously encouraging for anyone who wonders if there's any hope for change.|Fresh
While there has been some streamlining of the facts for the sake of storytelling efficiency, an outraged and righteous heart beats strongly throughout.|Fresh
There have been surprisingly few cinematic renderings of Martin Luther King Jr's legacy, but despite the lack of competition, British actor David Oyelowo's embodiment of the great man is simply superb.|Fresh
If you don't mind the technical confusion it's a gripping story, and a great credit to DuVernay and co-writer Paul Webb who were unable to use King's original speeches for copyright reasons.|Fresh
Ava DuVernay's Selma is a beautifully observed drama of public and private lives, of personal narratives and historic moments.|Fresh
DuVernay, with just her third feature film, knows how to marshal the moments that will become history, making her own iconic images.|Fresh
An important and necessary film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The structure with which the film is designed turns out to be as beneficial and intriguing as it is unsatisfactory and imprecise. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Listen to Common's track over the final credits. This movie is continuing a conversation that America cannot ignore.|Fresh
Selma is an always-gripping, often-bruising film, with fantastic performances and a solidly written script that contextualizes King's work in an effectively impactful way.|Fresh
Don't let this put you off Selma: it's a good, although not great movie, that steers a coherent path through a weighty historical moment.|Fresh
Director DuVernay has crafted a cinematic work for the ages, with a magnificent performance from Oyelowo.|Fresh
David Oyelowo is magnetic in his quiet, still performance and for those unfamiliar with these events, DuVernay's film is quite an education - it's also one historical drama with a very contemporary and real message.|Fresh
Looks better than the average historical drama; some top-notch performances, especially from Oyelowo; occasional moments of greatness|Fresh
With more nuance, this could have been a great film. As it is, it's merely a good one, but glittering with great performances.|Fresh
What Selma does particularly well is balance the ideological in-fighting within the Civil Rights movement.|Fresh
This heartfelt, compelling docudrama about Martin Luther King Jr. and the 1965 civil rights marches shows how far we've come.|Fresh
[Ava DuVernay] manages to get both the small and the big moments. Thiis at one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
I this movie has some of the most powerful moments I've seen I think all year.|Fresh
What a bold stroke of sensory genius on [Ava DuVernary's] part to lull us into a false sense of security before slapping us in the face with the reality that Selma is not your usual biography.|Fresh
For all the wobbles, when the film reaches its climax the sheer force of history bends toward its fascinating mid-60s moment.|Fresh
Selma is the kind of expert filmmaking that's long been absent from an American tradition of historical reenactment-it manages the forgotten art of depicting the graceful human beings that made it history in the first place.|Fresh
Selma is an important movie, yes, but it is also a great one.|Fresh
Selma is a triumphant no hold barred and amazingly directed biopic, with a gripping depth in the story and strong performances all around especially from David Oyelowo.|Fresh
A vital and timely missive to a new generation that is as sobering as it is uplifting, all built around a performance of astounding accomplishment.|Fresh
There are no wasted moments here. There are no wasted characters. The film is as much about Martin Luther King Jr. as it is about the people he worked with, and fought for.|Fresh
Selma is a stark reminder that there are still plenty of injustices in the world that we'd like to think had gone away 50 years ago.|Fresh
It is a very, very good movie, beautifully shot by Bradford Young and deftly, almost astonishingly well-directed by relative newcomer Ava DuVernay.|Fresh
King's story is tragic, that's no spoiler. The film ends with a heavy heart, mixed with hope. Selma is an important film and it is profoundly moving.|Fresh
It captures something more elusive in our fictions and in our politics: the feeling and dynamic of a collective movement.|Fresh
Selma is worth the price of admission. The real gift of this film is reflection as well as hope that the new generations do not repeat history. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film... assumes such vast prior knowledge of the civil rights movement that only a fraction of the audience will understand it. I scrambled to keep up, not helped by a cast of thousands and by Ava DuVernay's clumsy and flabby direction.|Rotten
Selma is not just a chronicle of historical developments; it aims to do more than just involve us in King's fight and move us as it unfolds. The film is very frequently moving, but it has higher, more intelligent goals than that.|Fresh
... its relevance grows in times when tempers are easily exasperated and the use of violence is privileged. Here it is, I insist, the best of Selma. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A racially and politically charged biopic full of vivid violent imagery that is sure to haunt viewers, and an emotionally gripping performance from David Oyelowo as the spiritual civil rights movement leader|Fresh
Selma gives back to the Civil Rights movement its urgent and motivating anger, when too often the movement has been misrepresented as a cause of infinitely patient, infinitely forbearing martyrs.|Fresh
So, is Selma the film I wanted? No. Is is a good film? Yes, but it's not great.|Fresh
Selma forces a kind of reckoning for its viewer. At these moments, you won't be able to look away. And you shouldn't.|Fresh
Selma has the intimacy of a chamber piece, but not much sense of the mass character of the Selma protests, of the thousands of arrests that had been made even before King got to town.|Fresh
This story is powerful and inspiring stuff. The skill used to tell it should be witnessed by all.|Fresh
Selma is a vital, brutal, and inspiring film.|Fresh
[Selma] shows well the heartbreaking personal sacrifices made by those who wanted to be free, to be free at last, to cast their vote to effect change.|Fresh
As protests continue to erupt, it becomes ever more apparent that we need models of effective change. Selma fits that bill stirringly.|Fresh
One of the biggest triumphs of director DuVernay's Selma is how she reverses that erasure: Her film, which centers on the march Martin Luther King Jr. led in 1964, has women in nearly every frame.|Fresh
A monumental achievement.|Fresh
It's all highly measured and tasteful, a rare thing when cinema and sacred cows meet.|Fresh
The timeliness of the picture, coupled with the immediacy of the filmmaking, renders 'Selma' more powerful than even its skilled creators could've possibly intended.|Fresh
Sacha Baron Cohen at Harvard, as character Ali G: 'Some of you has probably never even seen a black man before, like that great civil rights leader, Martin Luther Vandross...'|Fresh
Selma isn't a discrete story of one moment in time that we can observe safely from the sidelines. It is all around us, every day.|Fresh
It's the quieter moments where Oyelowo really excels.|Fresh
By avoiding this film being a straight bio-pic or relationship drama, DuVernay has created a historical and political drama that resonates today.|Fresh
Oyelowo is the real deal, monumental in a film that isn't, muscling a middling historical drama into something absolutely worth seeing.|Fresh
... about the cost and the stakes of movement. Oyelowo plays King with grace and dignity, but he's always aware of what people are putting on the line.|Fresh
There are sections in Selma that I treasure.|Fresh
Taken as a whole, it's a deeply affecting, incendiary film and the most focused, accomplished biopic in a year of numerous offerings.|Fresh
Ultimately, what makes DuVernay's movie so good and necessary is that it actually lets us see the arc of the moral universe bending -- being bent, by human will -- toward justice.|Fresh
This isn't just one of the best movies of 2014. It's the most relevant and certainly the most important.|Fresh
The feeling that the victories of 1965 can be viewed through our 2015 eyes as unfulfilled promises gives Selma its present-day juice.|Fresh
By taking us inside King's inner circle, we discover how courage, conviction and political savvy bring about change.|Fresh
The result is a compellingly flesh-and-blood depiction of King; an absorbingly sophisticated account of his brand of non-violent activism.|Fresh
Most importantly, though, Selma reminds us where the violence started - with the insidious, everyday practice of denying African Americans their legal right to vote.|Fresh
Director Ava DuVernay has given us Selma, a docudrama about a pivotal campaign in the fight for civil rights for black Americans. You could say this film writes history not so much with lightning as with compassion.|Fresh
Selma is an interesting and engaging glimpse of the civil rights movement at one of its most powerful moments. It won't be the civil rights movie to define all civil rights movies, but it carries a worthwhile message.|Fresh
This rousing, passionate civil rights drama is exquisitely timed, a quality that's just as important and elusive as greatness.|Fresh
Unforgettable. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An overdue tribute to a revered icon and to some unsung foot soldiers who played a critical role at a seminal moment in the courageous African-American struggle for freedom and equality.|Fresh
A powerful examination of one of the key moments of the Civil Rights movement and the man who sacrificed made it possible.|Fresh
A treasure trove of outstanding performances, brilliant writing and heartfelt direction.|Fresh
The breadth of the film's scope is impressive, as it manages to sketch in the enormity and diversity of the movement without being spread too thin.|Fresh
Selma may have come out during a renewed period of racial tension, but its lasting relevance lies in its clear-headed depiction of the constant negotiation between inflamed passions and cold-blooded politicking that progresses any kind of social struggle.|Fresh
With inspired performances and an even more inspiring story, this film is more than just a fantastic biopic about a great man; it is also a call to action.|Fresh
Selma achieves the rare accolade of being a powerful period piece with stark contemporary resonance.|Fresh
"Do not believe anyone trying to make ""Selma"" a factional thing, a liberal or conservative, black, white, or hashtag movie. It transcends all that. It is a great American story, well told, and nothing less."|Fresh
Given the degree of difficulty of making such a film ring true in nearly all the right places, stands as a benchmark and is arguably the best film of 2014.|Fresh
As emotionally and racially charged as the film's story is, director Ava DuVernay is determined to deliver a full-bodied, balanced drama that derives its power from the central fight for understanding and respect.|Fresh
This electrifying film puts the tension, the fear, the courage, and the tragedy in perspective, and dramatizes it through the struggles of people, not rhetoric.|Fresh
Skilfully directed by Ava DuVernay and featuring a wonderful leading performance from David Oyelowo, Selma pulls back the curtain on a riveting piece of U.S. history.|Fresh
First rate.|Fresh
The repeated references to nonviolence form an especially powerful theme, a reminder of what can be accomplished not through simply taking revenge, but by staying your hand.|Fresh
With the events of Ferguson so fresh in our memories, Selma is uncomfortable yet necessary viewing.|Fresh
A stirring moment for civil rights, and one of the year's best|Fresh
For all its evasions, short cuts, and mismanaged ideas, Selma can't be dismissed. Its modest achievements engross.|Fresh
DuVernay says she doesn't like typical historical dramas, and it shows.|Fresh
In compact, economical form, DuVernay sets out her table: the juxtaposition of domestic intimacy and institutional violence; the tension between the personal and political; the vivid interplay between the historical and the contemporary.|Fresh
It is artful, inspiring, perfectly cast and powerfully acted, beautifully shot, scored with sensitivity rather than sentimentality, efficiently edited, profoundly dignified.|Fresh
Oyewolo brilliantly conveys [King's] incandescent gifts ... his shrewd tactical intelligence, blazing moral conviction and spellbinding rhetorical power.|Fresh
The trivia fact that Selma and Salem are anagrams of each other is only relevant because as were the 17th witch hunts of Salem, the 20th century racist witch hunts of Selma were propelled by bigoted ignorance|Fresh
It's a role of a lifetime for classically trained English actor David Oyelowo, whose distinguished performance ably embodies the physicality and essence of the pastor, humanitarian and human rights activist|Fresh
An astonishing story, told with grace|Fresh
A magnificent film, vital and alive, with the most profound sense of immediacy I think I've ever felt in a historical story.|Fresh
One of the finest biopics in recent memory, this drama manages to present someone as iconic as Martin Luther King Jr. as a normal man anyone can aspire to emulate.|Fresh
In some ways it's beyond criticism as the first-ever major movie about this heroic campaigner.|Fresh
The famed American civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr has been strangely under-represented in the cinema. Ava DuVernay's excellent third film thankfully puts this continued omission right.|Fresh
Selma is a rousing political drama, made with enough verve and passion never merely to seem didactic. Its near complete absence from this year's Oscar nominations is baffling and suggests a double standard.|Fresh
In Selma, British actor David Oyelowo subtly transmogrifies himself into Martin Luther King Jr, displaying intelligent self-doubt, not flash political pomp.|Fresh
Oyelowo is sensational in Selma. He makes you believe, body and soul, heart and mind, in his performance as Martin Luther King.|Fresh
The overall sense of righteous, non-violent anger is palpable.|Fresh
It's high time MLK got the big-screen platform he deserves. Thanks to Selma, justice has been done.|Fresh
The film's old-fashioned emotional surge accentuates the absurdity of it taking half a century for Hollywood to properly address Martin Luther King's legacy.|Fresh
Even before our ears catch the mention of Ferguson in the closing song, Selma has proved itself fiercely modern and aggressively cinematic.|Fresh
Selma is always involving.|Fresh
The film firmly centres on the intimate, reminiscent of Spielberg's Lincoln, where grandiosity is found in performance not pedestals.|Fresh
In which the fight for black rights, instead of having a fiery and inspiring crackle, is like being hit over the head with a long, soggy sermonette.|Rotten
Ava DuVernay's vital civil rights drama is the film Martin Luther King deserved.|Fresh
A passionate movie, commanding and compelling, all about Martin Luther King and his civil rights march in 1965 from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital Montgomery.|Fresh
It is beyond baffling why British actor David Oyelowo has not been nominated for either a BAFTA or an Oscar for his exceptional lead performance as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in new drama, Selma.|Fresh
It is an invigorating movie, this Selma, with the characters and rhetoric providing much of the power.|Fresh
While it takes sizable liberties with history to move us, it is at times genuinely stirring.|Fresh
Incredibly powerful and often moving, anchored by an awards-worthy performance from Oyelowo.|Fresh
This is a film as confident and assured in its moral fortitude, and as soaringly powerful in its oratory, as the great man himself.|Fresh
A daunting challenge for any actor, Oyelowo rises to the task, in a film that eschews the traditional biopic approach.|Fresh
The power of Ava DuVernay's astonishing film comes from its understanding of the limits of King's work as much as its celebration of his achievements.|Fresh
[David Oyelowo] gives a huge, heartfelt performance (iniquitously ignored by the Academy) and he seems mindful, too, that the story is bigger than one man.|Fresh
Selma's achievements defy those of regular films.|Fresh
Selma is an almost impassable minefield of opportunities to make a bad film. Director Ava DuVernay danced through like Fred Astair.|Fresh
...in many ways remarkable, one of the best conventional Hollywood movies to ever engage the seemingly intractable American problem of racial injustice.|Fresh
"Think of it as ""Civil Rights for beginners."""|Fresh
It's a movie concerned with the march, and its most nimble work is in illuminating scenes rather than trying to explicate them.|Fresh
...does not shy away from controversial elements of King's character.|Fresh
Reminds that underneath the legend Martin Luther King was a pure Christian soul, who relied upon and used the Christian faith to battle injustice both on the streets and in the corridors of political power.|Fresh
It is a moving and well-meaning film that never quite manages the greatness one expects, given its soaring subject material.|Fresh
Captures a sense of events unfolding in the present tense, in a political and cultural climate as complex, multifaceted and undetermined as the times we live in.|Fresh
Needless to say, Dr. King's message has never been more relevant.|Fresh
A cinematic masterpiece, this feature may be small in scope but it's momentous in its ability to capture how complex and powerful the civil rights movement was.|Fresh
"""Selma presents a multidimensional portrayal of Dr. King, flaws and all, and it makes us wonder how far we've actually come today."""|Fresh
Succinctly demonstrates we've both come a long way and have a long way to go.|Fresh
Selma manages to beautifully articulate a pivotal moment in history - one that is hauntingly ironic in how it echoes our current times and society.|Fresh
One of the most powerful examples of sacrifice one will see in this century.|Fresh
A blast of piercing social insight expressed through exquisite craftsmanship that makes it feel like art and not bald-faced messaging.|Fresh
"""Selma,"" on top of all of its many other virtues, is an inspiring movie about politics being done right."|Fresh
What makes the film -- for any of its shortcomings -- such a vital work is how relevant its depiction of the events of 50 years ago are to today.|Fresh
As the 50th anniversary of the events it depicts approaches, 'Selma' feels chillingly contemporary, all too real, and monumental in more ways than one.|Fresh
It will be 50 years this August that Johnson signed the bill giving everyone the right to vote, but we are still struggling with many of these same issues today. How is that even possible?|Fresh
"""Selma"" is a phenomenally stirring production that should be seen by everyone who believes in racial equality. And even more so by anyone who does not."|Fresh
has the power to enrage and enlighten|Fresh
At its best, the new movie about King cracks the civil rights leader and his associates from their plaster-saint cocoons.|Fresh
Inspiring and impassioned, delivering Rev. Dr. King's reverberating message of perserverance.|Fresh
Their camaraderie and the heated arguments capture the essence of the personalities and issues. . .in a large and impressive ensemble of African-American character actors.|Fresh
...founded on a communal sense of historical accomplishment.|Fresh
It's a movie, yes. But this stirring account of the fight to end racially motivated voting impediments in the Deep South is more than anything a much-needed wake-up call for a country that has seriously lost its way in terms of equality.|Fresh
"Despite all the great things you'll hear about ""Selma"" - an important, Oprah-endorsed awards-season biopic - it actually is great."|Fresh
It's a King-size role for this terrific actor.|Fresh
There were better movies released during 2014 than Selma -- though all could be counted on just one hand with the thumb neatly tucked underneath -- but were there any that were more topical, more important, more monumental?|Fresh
A well-intentioned yet persistently underwhelming drama...|Fresh
What could be simplistic schmaltz ends up being a harsh rebuke of symbolic gestures.|Fresh
Directed with confidence by Ava DuVernay, it's a movie about how King changed America by having the canny political genius to show the country an image of itself that it could not bear.|Fresh
Hollywoodized to the extent of depicting President Lyndon Johnson as an obstructionist to the African-American cause. Nonetheless, 'Selma' is compelling cinema.|Fresh
With protestors organizing what feels like could evolve into another Civil Rights Movement, Selma is an important document of those who went before.|Fresh
Selma is one of so many well-meaning historical dramas that fall prey to their overpowering stories. Gravitas abounds in every scene.|Fresh
Selma is about America at its worst -- and very best.|Fresh
David Oyelowo is superb; film is remarkably topical and relevant.|Fresh
... pays tribute by resonating more deeply when considered in the context of current events.|Fresh
...a film that demands to be seen, despite its flaws. It's part of American history and a story that we should all know.|Fresh
It's understandable that DuVernay would make a priority of avoiding excessive detail. But too much of the movie is like the opening: deliberate, broad, uninspired.|Rotten
Like Dr. King did, the film captures your mind and your heart as it entertains, the way great movies often do.|Fresh
A film this heartfelt and intelligent about social justice will never be unimportant, but it feels especially relevant today.|Fresh
Oyelowo's performance exists on a single continuum, convincing us that the man inspiring millions is the same man we saw grieving alone just a few minutes before. He's the man we knew, and never knew.|Fresh
Selma is one of the great emotional experiences of recent years; a fiercely powerful look at one of the Civil Rights Movement's most triumphant victories.|Fresh
The paint-by-numbers portrayals of 1960s iconic players is pathetic and the story fails to capture the passion, energy and hope of MLK's leadership and of the times.|Rotten
At times borders on the Shakespearean.|Fresh
Without Oyelowo's texture and firepower, perhaps the picture would've been understood, but it wouldn't have been as precise in its emotion.|Fresh
An uneven yet generally skillful effort that has probably drawn more praise and criticism than it warrants.|Fresh
This is what Selma dares to do so well: show us the small, private moments in King's life, the intimacies, the humanity.|Fresh
DuVernay shows visual assurance and a way with actors and especially words.|Fresh
The skilfully re-created look of the era in the actual locations lets the viewer drop right into one of the darkest chapters in U.S. history, a time when blind hatred and bigotry set public policy.|Fresh
It's films like Selma that remind us that behind every massive pivotal moment there are a thousands of smaller stories that come together like raindrops forming a ground-shaking thunderstorm.|Fresh
As a film, Selma is solid if unspectacular. As a dramatic portrayal of recent U.S. history, however, Selma burns with a fierce intensity.|Fresh
DuVernay's film deals less in the outcome than in the immediate, and it's hardly ever sentimental or manipulative, a common trait of films that are based on true events, used to make sure you feel inspired.|Fresh
We see history as it unfolds, not as it has been encased in amber, in a movie that needs to be seen in these anxious days of renewed racial and cultural unrest.|Fresh
The movie is riveting. It reminds us not only of how far we have come as a society but how far we have yet to go.|Fresh
Deeply-felt drama depicting the worst of America and the best of America. David Oyelowo is excellent.|Fresh
It may be coincidence that Selma reverberates with a particular timeliness...Still, it's thanks to director DuVernay and first-time features writer Paul Webb that the film has more than the luck of timing on its side.|Fresh
Selma is a passionate and utterly important historical recounting, unimpeachable for its modern relevancy, and moving in its cinematic telling.|Fresh
Although Selma is dramatically uneven overall, the film is a commendable historical drama that sidesteps the pitfalls of adulatory biopics and great-man approaches to encapsulating bygone events.|Fresh
Even some of the film's strongest proponents are positioning the film as a good-for-you, syllabus-ready obligation. That's an affront to the intelligence, cinematic flexibility and emotional satisfaction of this rousing film.|Fresh
Selma shines a painful light on the events of 1965, from the tragic bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., church to the police brutality during the first effort to begin a march from Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge.|Fresh
A Powerful Reminder of Sacrifice and Struggle.|Fresh
"To see ""Selma"" is to feel and appreciate anew the burden of greatness."|Fresh
"In an era of comic-book movies, ""Selma"" is an impressive reminder of the real-life struggle for human dignity."|Fresh
A somber and distressingly relevant tribute to King and his fellow compatriots in the civil-rights movement of the 1960s.|Fresh
No movie in memory feels as necessary as Selma, while the history it portrays is echoed by current events. When the value of black lives is asserted in the streets by marchers of all colors, spurred by wrongs to be righted, indignities to overcome.|Fresh
"Nearly everyone who goes to ""Selma"" will know the rough outlines of the story, but DuVernay has made a vigorous and surprising film."|Fresh
As history 'Selma' may cause some controversy, but as fact-based drama it's exceptionally fine.|Fresh
Though these events occurred half a century ago, their power and relevance are undiminished.|Fresh
"History becomes breathtaking drama in ""Selma""; there's an urgent realism in the storytelling, as if we're seeing this just in time. And indeed we are ..."|Fresh
Selma creates a sense of real life being lived, rather than just facts and figures being dramatized.|Fresh
Director Ava DuVernay...wisely shifts the emphasis away from the person - it's hard to make a movie about a saint, even a secular one - and onto the process.|Fresh
Selma is wet paint Americans (especially young ones) had probably best watch dry, as we remember the past and contemplate where the country goes from here.|Fresh
Selma, the latest in a long string of strong biopics out over the last year, deserves your undivided attention.|Fresh
"""Selma"" demands to be seen now and by the generations that follow."|Fresh
Earnest, but only occasionally inspiring and a bit of an overreach, especially in the casting.|Fresh
The brilliance of Ava DuVernay's Selma lies in how it makes a man out of a historical icon without diminishing his greatness in the slightest.|Fresh
Selma is an important history lesson that never feels like a lecture. Once school is back in session, every junior high school class in America should take a field trip to see this movie.|Fresh
Still, what is most startling about Selma isn't its painstaking presentation of this painful history, but how salient that history remains nearly 50 years on.|Fresh
History, written in lightning: writer-director Ava DuVernay's third feature, understated yet righteously furious, beautifully dramatizes a few crucial months in the civil-rights movement and the life of Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo, electric).|Fresh
While Selma hardly redefines the comfortably historical struggle genre, it injects it with some political intelligence and a touch of the cynical humor that goes hand-in-hand with knowledge of such things.|Fresh
This is lucid in its political analysis and sobering in its depictions of racially motivated violence, though it sometimes comes off as stolid.|Fresh
"A stunning achievement and an interesting comparison to Spielberg's ""Lincoln"", a film that gave short shrift to Black self-emancipation, something that attests to the need for Black directors like Ava DuVernay."|Fresh
If not quite in quality then certainly in import and impact, this is the film of the year - of 1965 and perhaps of 2014.|Fresh
[A] thoroughly engrossing portrayal of politics in its most rudimentary shape, it is also a rousing representation of the concept of democracy at its best and most potent.|Fresh
A film of great power and integrity, fiercely attentive to the tipping point of progress and the difficult decisions that push it forward.|Fresh
The year's most powerful and emotionally-gripping film seems as necessary and essential now as it did nearly 50 years ago.|Fresh
This is no soup-to-nuts King biopic.|Fresh
David Oyelowo is as believable in a quiet domestic scene as he is in his most majestic moments, in filmmaker Du Vernay's skillful re-creation of this period in recent American history.|Fresh
Easily one of the most important and relevant films of the year.|Fresh
The true brilliance of David Oyelowo's work--and that of Ava DuVernay, for that matter--lies in the delicate balance between duly respecting King as a historical icon and incisively studying King as a man.|Fresh
A fascinating depiction of a turbulent time in American history.|Fresh
A stately, sober film, at times uplifting and at others agonizing.|Fresh
"If ""Selma"" is limited by the kind of film it needed to be and by what its studio proprietors wanted to sell, it's still the best and most intimate fictional portrayal of the civil rights movement, by a long shot."|Fresh
A major part of the film's success, however, lies in Oyelowo's masterful portrayal.|Fresh
DuVernay's most remarkable accomplishment may be that with such passion-inspiring material, she has made such a measured, resolute and levelheaded film.|Fresh
At its best, Ava DuVernay's biographical film honors Dr. King's legacy by dramatizing the racist brutality that spurred him and his colleagues to action.|Fresh
Outstanding drama about MLK's fight for equal rights.|Fresh
