The funny, sad Dark Horse adds a creepy loser in love to the director's catalog of misanthropes.|Fresh

I got a little choked up watching these old miners, barmaids, former pit workers and retirees chasing a very odd dream they didn't even know they had then grabbing on to it like a lifeline when the dream starts to feel real.|Fresh

Dark Horse has humor, a look at racing society from the ground up, life in a small Welsh town, and the love of animals.|Fresh
Great Feel-Good Story|Fresh

"Predictably charming and sentimental ""one Welsh town and its horse"" tale. It's just quirky enough."|Fresh
Sweet without being cloying, crowd-pleasing without being obviously manipulative, this is how this kind of tale ought to be told. See it now before Hollywood decides to remake it.|Fresh
"The whole affair has a Caddyshack-esque ""snobs against the slobs"" vibe to it."|Fresh
You don't need to be an equine enthusiast to become captivated by this inspiring documentary.|Fresh

Dark Horse is an incredible tale about luck and pluck.|Fresh
If Dark Horse were not a documentary, viewers might find its story a bit of a long shot.|Fresh
"Midway through it I scrawled in my notebook: ""This is the movie that 'Seabiscuit' wanted to be, and wasn't."""|Fresh
Any eventual feel-good narrative film based on this story will have a lot to live up to.|Fresh
The interviewees are the main attraction... but a surprisingly vivid presence is Dream Alliance himself, who comes off as a scrappy animal with a gamely competitive spirit and a lot of horse sense (no pun intended).|Fresh
Hits most of the sweet spots: colorful characters, a lovable animal, an informative but not stuffy tone, a story you probably don't already know, and a short running time.|Fresh
Dark Horse is all clich and yet it's OK. It's sincere. It has a heart. It's cheery and unpretentious and the cast of characters are ingenuous and appealing.|Fresh
Americans seem uncommonly uncomfortable discussing our own class struggles. But, boy, do we love to watch the Brits do it. I think that's one reason the inspiring and joyful Dark Horse is such an appealing film.|Fresh
A remarkable tale about ordinary people, and Osmond keeps it simple with her conventional style and good-natured manipulation.|Fresh
Regardless of whether Dream Alliance wins, places, or shows, he and this lovely film are, without question, a sure bet.|Fresh
The resulting film feels a little rough, but as long as you don't look it in the mouth it should appeal to those who like a good under-horse story.|Fresh
A crowd-pleasing tale of winning against all odds that's practically impossible not to like.|Fresh
An inspiring tale heard, as it were, straight from the horse's mouth.|Fresh
Osmond doesn't belabor style in any way, opting to shape the story simply and directly through the new interviews, available archive materials, and efficient montage.|Fresh
Osmond may tell the story to wring maximum emotion out of the audience, but so what? Isn't that why people make these movies? It is. And more importantly, it's why people watch them.|Fresh
"Anyone who has a love for our equine friends and horse racing will enjoy ""Dark Horse"" to the fullest."|Fresh
"""Dark Horse"" isn't the usual rags to riches story, nor is it a Hollywood tale of an unparalleled athlete that overcomes everything in his path. It's about having a dream and seeing it through and the lifelong bonds and satisfaction that follow."|Fresh
Osmond has given moviegoers a delightful and inspirational experience we may have otherwise missed|Fresh
Won the Audience Award at Sundance last year, and it's easy to see why.|Fresh
An unexpectedly touching story of pure love.|Fresh
The unquestionably uplifting Dark Horse is halfway to being a narrative film as it is, re-creating many scenes both profoundly emotional and deeply silly.|Fresh
Osmond reaches for political relevance [but] it seems peripheral to the investors' agenda of patting themselves on the back.|Rotten
This endearing and original documentary about the unlikeliest of thoroughbred horses and the Welsh barmaid who bred him simply wires the field in the Unbelievable Derby.|Fresh
At times, the documentary's unhurried pace verges on the slow. Ultimately, though, it is such a feel-good story that it's best not to rush things.|Fresh
Who can resist a good horse story?|Fresh
An exhilarating tribute to an overachieving underdog that turned a barmaid's fanciful dream into a reality.|Fresh
"Louise Osmond's ""Dark Horse"" is a slight but winning documentary about a most unlikely event, and I hope Hollywood doesn't get wind of it."|Fresh
It's told with an uncommon level of pathos and craft, emphasizing the symbolic personal victories above the historical viewpoint.|Fresh
Dark Horse's primary function is to inspire, and Osmond does this capably; at a fleet 85 mins, the film hardly overstays its welcome, even if it'd hardly be a struggle to spend more time with the boisterous, sometimes toothless members of the syndicate.|Fresh
Stirring, inspiring docu about unlikely champion.|Fresh
It would be hard for any fictional treatment to beat the pleasures of Osmond's genial, enthralling documentary.|Fresh
It's true that Dark Horse relies a bit too heavily on commercial race footage. Yet the movie grows into uplift of a whole other kind.|Fresh
Unfolding with a sincerity that dares you to roll your eyes, this warmhearted documentary by Louise Osmond wallows in its working-class roots like a horse in clover.|Fresh
"The special appeal of ""Dark Horse"" is that it's about many more things, all of them fascinating, than its starting point would suggest."|Fresh
[A] crowd-pleasing documentary ...|Fresh
If you aren't already a horseracing enthusiast, Dark Horse offers very little that will interest you in its come-from-behind story.|Rotten
For the many, many viewers who've never heard of Dream Alliance, Osmond's documentary is edge-of-the-seat stuff.|Fresh
This horse tale mostly moves and delights.|Fresh
A defiantly inspirational, rags-to-riches equine story that's patched together from archival footage....|Fresh
Exciting though the races are, the film is most powerful as a tribute to Dream's many owners and to the community spirit -- dare I say solidarity -- of these working-class folk urging their horse to beat the odds.|Fresh
It gets the job done well enough, but you'll be left wondering why the movie doesn't trust you to appreciate Dream Alliance's story on your own.|Fresh

Osmond might have delved deeper into the morality of National Hunt racing, but with editor Joby Gee she ably relates the account with archive footage, photographs and a few blurry re-constructions.|Fresh
With its sheer warmth and likability, this good-natured documentary won my heart - a real-life The Full Monty or Billy Elliot or Pride.|Fresh
Osmond's documentary is inspiring and emotive but it is never manipulative. The characters are working-class pragmatists and Osmond should be applauded for making no attempt to disguise this.|Fresh
Just as Dream Alliance never quite escapes his lowly background, so 'Dark Horse' sometimes feels like a small-screen runner trying to jump big-screen fence.|Fresh
More stirring than National Velvet, less sentimental than Champions, Dark Horse never contrives to make us cry. And, like a well-told tale at the pub, it grips from start to finish.|Fresh
"""Dark Horse"" is crowd-pleasing and sometimes even amiably moving, but never quite essential."|Fresh
A heartwarming true story that has been expertly crafted into an irresistible, emotion-charged documentary.|Fresh
