Hilarious, shocking and poignant, careering through your scepticism at 100 miles an hour, it deserves a 5.8 for both technical merit and artistic expression. And despite claiming to put across different points of view it's unashamedly pro-Tonya Harding.|Fresh
A delightfully acerbic look into a poisoned American Dream, where adulation is worth going to prison for.|Fresh

I, Tonya addresses its questions of truth, history, celebrity, and mythology with the subtlety of blunt force trauma.|Rotten
There are so many threads running through I, Tonya that none get the opportunity to be pulled through to the end, and all feel incomplete.|Rotten
I, Tonya earns critical respect for its shrewd commentary on the instant gratification of tabloid television/sleazy journalism.|Fresh
I, Tonya fondly evokes the hysterical chaos of Goodfellas while maintaining a casual earnestness... A tragic laugh riot from start to finish.|Fresh
I was surprised by the regressive fat shaming in I, Tonya.|Rotten
Basically [frames] Harding's life as an ongoing cycle of abuse and explicitly naming the media of the time and the audience that laughed along with it as complicit in that abuse.|Fresh
Here's a story that's about the tragic cycle of abuse and Gillespie and company try to mine the constant abuse and degradation of Tonya Harding for cheap laughs, as if the cycle of abuse is comical as long the participants are dumb white trash.|Rotten
I, Tonya isn't intended for uplift or to leave you thinking that the hard-fought battle for equality has been won; instead we have a woman, alone, bruised, and bloodied, still fighting.|Fresh
It's a problematic film, for many reasons, but the sensational performances of Robbie and Janney make it a must-see.|Fresh
Exhilarating, compelling and downright fun.|Fresh
It's equal parts tragic and hilarious and is very self-aware of the story it's telling. They milk every aspect of it and leave you wanting more.|Fresh
It's dark, funny, and even moving.|Fresh
Thankfully Tonya inevitably takes the spotlight back so that Robbie can prove her strength as a formidable acting force once and for all.|Fresh
Margot Robbie absolutely slays in I, Tonya, particularly in the third act. Her performance picks up speed and evolves throughout the film.|Fresh
Consistently fascinating and absorbing dramatic storytelling with a vein of jet-black humour pulsing throughout.|Fresh
How much Harding knew or didn't know about the attack on Kerrigan is somewhat secondary, if that can be believed.|Fresh
Though occasionally glib, it's powerfully pointed about how willingly the public accepted the classist tale about what kind of person Harding was.|Fresh
The stellar performance here, though, is Janney's. With her harsh brunette bowl cut, oversized glasses, scowling expression, and spewing expletives in every scene, Janney is nothing short of riveting.|Fresh
Allison Janney just killed it. Every time she was on screen.|Fresh
It's really a rather sad tale, but Rogers' script and the editing make this biopic surprisingly hilarious. Still it does not demean the brutality and cyclical effects of abuse.|Fresh
I, Tonya just breathed life into the bloated biopic genre - it is sharp, on point soundtrack and definitely skates on thin ice in places. A must see.|Fresh
Robbie emotes so strongly and puts forward the performance of a lifetime within I, Tonya. Every single thing that she felt throughout the movie, I felt in my theatre seat.|Fresh
I, Tonya is a delicate, bold, and dangerous balancing act, reminiscent of the incredibly difficult triple axel, a skating move that is either career-defining or career-ending, and Robbie and company sticks the landing.|Fresh
Gillespie is having so much fun...that you get the feeling he could make a movie about the contents of a phone book and it'd be deliciously entertaining.|Fresh
An engaging biopic with strong performances.|Fresh
Balances perfectly on a double-edged blade: the outside edge of satire and the inside edge of tragedy.|Fresh
Furthermore, the film lazily utilises a fake documentary format that only seeks to highlight how much better the story was told in The Price of Gold.|Rotten
The only thing that mattered was the sensational story. This film let us truly see and decide for ourselves how to make sense of it all.|Fresh
Believe me, it pains me to say this as someone who's firmly Team Nancy, but Harding doesn't deserve this.|Rotten
I, Tonya may be touted for its dark sense of humor, but beneath its (frequently quite literal) punchlines lives an unsettling horror film.|Fresh
... a bizarre peek into the motivations and misrememberings of a speeding train about to derail... doesn't ask for forgiveness, only some understanding of what a talented person without privilege was up against from the very beginning.|Fresh
Neither Gillespie nor writer Steven Rogers has the sensibility to lucidly, subtly navigate the black comedic tone for which they reach.|Rotten
The film is as much a snapshot of American hypocrisies as it is a diligent portrayal of a gifted figure skater trapped by her impoverished social circumstances and abusive relations with the people closest to her - namely her mother and her husband.|Fresh
I, Tonya is a sympathetic portrayal, made more so by the always engaging Robbie, which may not sit well with some...shifts in tone become more awkward still when it comes to the attack...more of a problem is the absence of Janney in the latter stages.|Rotten
It's a condescending, exploitative piece of awards bait that desperately tries to disguise its lack of insight through mocking self-awareness.|Rotten
...an experience that's both hilarious and dramatically satisfying; an unconventional biopic full of great performances... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Margot Robbie gets into the skin of Tonya Harding in a performance forced to transcend the physical. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
I, Tonya adopts the right tone to relate the factual tale of the whacked kneecap, spinning it in a darkly comedic direction.|Fresh
The ice skating in I, Tonya left me wanting more winter sports, not less.|Fresh
With a wildly-entertaining story and an outstanding cast, Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya succeeds wonderfully as a compelling biopic about the rise and disgraceful fall of the titular figure skating star.|Fresh
Gillespie's film in a breath of fresh, icy air, in the midst of so many serious and emotionless films that only seek to win prizes. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
...an exciting two hours. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This will go down as one of the best modern sports movies. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
... Australian Margot Robbie is great in her role. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Gillespie has imbued his film with black humour, while never undermining the authenticity of the characters or detracting from the abuse that runs through the story.|Fresh
We, as spectators, are witnesses of this freak-show of an unfortunate but talented redneck who had everything to win but who, in reality, was born to lose. (Review in Spanish)|Fresh
Superb performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney elevate this funny, yet superficial account of Tonya Harding's rise and fall from profesional figure skating. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Margot Robbie slips into the role with ease, able to give nuances and credibility to the character. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The portrait of an extraordinary athlete who made a bad decision is valuable, as it contrasts women's generalized representation in cinema: That of ideal, exemplary women who never make mistakes. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

Director Craig Gillespie has fun with the characters, the era and a general air of insouciance Harding injected the prim world of figure-skating with.|Fresh
If Michael Bay's Pain and Gain had a little more restraint and humanity it might have played like I, Tonya.|Fresh
A great unexpected dark comedy that entertainingly demonstrates how all narratives are biased.|Fresh
While Harding is represented by Robbie as rude and unrepentant, the film makes clear where her rage comes from, highlighting the class prejudice in the heart of the world of skating... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Allison Janney's] undiluted unsentimentality is the perfect compliment for a sporting underdog movie that disobeys the rules.|Fresh
Robbie is utterly compelling as Harding. Her rendition is one of great depth, veneration and detail...I, Tonya offers an ambiguous and complex account of what really happened - or at least, what each person thinks really happened.|Fresh
As happens in Hollywood, Robbie is taller and lovelier than her subject, but she beautifully captures Harding's wide-eyed yearning to excel despite forbidding odds. When she lands the triple Axel, her sheer exultation is infectious.|Fresh
Craig Gillespie directs with all the subtlety of a baton-wielding thug but has made at least one brilliant decision in casting Margot Robbie, who is practically a machine for generating empathy.|Fresh
Despite the heavy subject matter, I, Tonya overflows with an unexpectedly infectious and uproarious energy, manifested in jazzy, kinetic edits and inventive visual and narrative flourishes.|Fresh
Everything is credible, exciting and sordidly funny, thanks to staging that plays well with brilliant, daring editing and exceptional female performances. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Perhaps the most impressive thing about this biopic is that the most unlikely details were even more ridiculous in real life. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Margot Robbie achieves one of her best performances to date... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Robbie is superb as Harding, a raw, determined young woman whose chippiness makes her hard to like. And Allison Janney's LaVona is a wonderful creation, a banal monster who gasps oxygen through a nasal tube while smoking furiously.|Fresh
Robbie, who produces as well as stars, is to be congratulated on making one of the few Oscar contenders that can be watched and enjoyed rather than endlessly analysed.|Fresh
Featuring multiple unreliable narrators, a cast of gotta-love-'em white-trash scoundrels and a script that would bring a blush to the cheek of a sailor, the film is essentially GoodFellas on Ice.|Fresh
Robbie never plays her as a victim. Instead she invests her with all the determination and grit of a born survivor who takes all the blows and still comes out fighting.|Fresh
Characters skate around the truth with almost as much dexterity as they do the ice rink|Fresh
Whatever your views on the US in general and Harding in particular, you'll leave this cheering for Margot Robbie. Bravo!|Fresh
Sharp, funny and alarmingly entertaining, this real life ice skating drama scores highly for artistic interpretation and technical accomplishment.|Fresh
This is the best movie of the year, yes I said it, I'm coming hot out of the gate here. It's funny, compelling, and there are so many things in this movie that reasonate so deeply as true, that I can't possibly cover them all.|Fresh
It leaves a sense of several stronger movies half-buried beneath a mish-mash of the poignantly heart-rending and the outlandishly farcical, and just about salvaged from mediocrity by its one sensational turn.|Fresh
It's terrible to watch a young woman becoming so conditioned to expect abusive behaviour from those closest to her, yet this film is also very funny. Somehow, it even extracts laughs from the domestic violence.|Fresh
A furiously engaging movie that features Margot Robbie in an ice rink, Margot Robbie at the action end of brutalising domestic abuse and, most significantly, Margot Robbie transforming fourth-wall breaking into a nearly sublime art form.|Fresh
She's as devious, calculating and horrible as the rest of them - and Margot Robbie's performance treads the fine line between our sympathy and judgement perfectly.|Fresh
Gillespie doesn't pull any punches in Harding's abuse, but at the same time he often seems to play it for laughs, trivialising it with humour and fourth-wall breaking asides that undermine its horror.|Rotten
There's some talking to camera, some breaking of the fourth wall, and a lot of ugliness and unfunny violence, played for laughs, which leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.|Rotten
One of those rare films that gets better as it continues.|Fresh
Compellingly stumped by its own heroine, the film simply can't make its mind up about Tonya Harding. If it did, it wouldn't get away with being such a blast.|Fresh
What does emerge from every account is that Tonya Harding was a force of nature, single-minded, very tough and always ready to keep on fighting, even if she had the fatalistic view that people from her background simply weren't allowed to become winners.|Fresh
A good story, told with flair if not finesse.|Fresh
...Margot Robbie shines. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Margot] Robbie's sympathetic yet complicated performance imbues it with truth and pathos.|Fresh
Whatever about Tonya Harding feeling hard done by, spare a though for Margot Robbie. In another year she'd slide through awards season and scoop up every gong going.|Fresh
Robbie and Janney are flawless in a compelling and corrective account of a misunderstood figure; one of the more darkly funny biopics you'll ever see.|Fresh
Gillespie's flippant biopic leans too heavily into lightness. Not only does it remain oddly silent on Kerrigan, but it feels flippant about domestic abuse ...|Rotten
An incredible real story... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
... [director Craig] Gillespie's latest cinematic release fails. With images of women being hit painted as humorous, the film speaks volumes with regards to Hollywood's attitude towards violence against women.|Rotten
A film that offers so much more than just 'the incident'.|Fresh
Robbie plays Harding from her teenage years through to her forties, moving between her naïveté as a young woman to her frustration as a competitor in the big leagues with poise.|Fresh
Like Tonya on the ice, this vicious black comedy is lean, mean and hard to take your eyes off.|Fresh
I, Tonya celebrates Harding's talent and admires her rebellious spirit but hides behind its humour as her hard-knock life becomes an irreverent, entertaining patchwork.|Fresh
I, Tonya wears its complete disregard for the truth quite proudly and is still probably a better portrait of the reality than anything we saw in the news at the time.|Fresh
A rather perceptive little film about the creation - and eventual destruction - of an Olympic athlete.|Fresh
... Steven Rogers' (Hope Floats, P.S. I Love You) screenplay is masterful...|Fresh
Above all else, Margot Robbie is the reason the film should be seen.|Fresh
... asks a lot of tough questions about class in America, even as it takes the same mocking tone that it accuses the media of taking as the scandal unfolded.|Fresh
Everything about I, Tonya feels too broad and glib to connect with anything real.|Rotten
Margot Robbie gives an incredible performance as Tonya.|Fresh
The mostly true story of ice skating's most striking woman. The terrific movie I Tonya, nominated for three Oscars this year, doesn't strive to tell the truth so much as to explore different truths.|Fresh
Tonya's hardships were depicted with straightforwardness; however, the film's narrative was not so effective, perennially wobbling between the cheaply dramatic and the absurdly comic.|Rotten
...the movie benefits substantially from Robbie's immersive turn as the far-from-likeable central character.|Fresh
In a superlative movie, the performances, the dialogue and the character development are memorable.|Fresh
"Surprisingly, ""I, Tonya"" works so well because writer Steve Rogers and director Craig Gillespie establish a winking, ironic, darkly devilish tone from the opening scene and never let go."|Fresh
I, Tonya invites us to understand the white-trash winter wonderland that was this young woman's reality - a place, you could say, where she couldn't win for losing...I, Tonya has a great feel for the tattered fringes of the American Dream.|Fresh
Central to I, Tonya is Robbie's masterful performance as Harding. If nothing else, it's worth watching for that alone.|Fresh
Bubbling up through Harding's tale is the prejudice imposed upon her because of her lowly class...This gives the film a sharp, if unintended, topicality by identifying one form of 21st-century bigotry that attracts curiously little attention.|Fresh
At its heart, this film asks its audience to accept a contradiction, which it sells with a knowing wink and rather successfully.|Fresh
There is much to admire about I, Tonya but it is also a very gruelling experience to undertake.|Fresh
[Margot] Robbie embraces her role completely, displaying much intensity and strength. She ditches her usual glamorous image for one that is crude and crass.|Fresh
Thanks to sharp writing, the talents of Robbie and Janney, and, at heart, compassion for its subject, I, Tonya is frequently hilarious, crucially revealing and resoundingly enjoyable.|Fresh
As an exploration of class and societal culpability, I, Tonya proves as smart as the questions it poses.|Fresh
The losers are the winners and will always have our sympathies. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
I, Tonya has a dangerous fizz. The drama isn't cheapened by comedy, and the comedy doesn't undermine the drama.|Fresh
This offers fine work from Robbie, Janney, Stan, Hauser and Bobby Cannavale.|Fresh
A broader biopic than you may be expecting ... very, very funny, but also moving and tough ... That's the kind of movie this is: not the kind you think, to its absolute credit.|Fresh
Even if you know what's coming in I, Tonya, this energetic biopic on disgraced Olympian figure skater Tonya Harding still packs surprises.|Fresh
For all the tabloid-baiting, trailer-trashing high-jinks recklessly commemorated here, there is also a subtle sense of sorrow conveyed about the wasted lives these events chewed up and spat out.|Fresh
The movie is a wildly entertaining if imperfect telling of the unlikely champion from the wrong side of the tracks and the violent 1994 incident that would go on to define her life.|Fresh
Maybe that's the fate this tragedy deserves: Tonya Harding wishes she wasn't a punchline, and yet her big-screen redemption plays like a big joke.|Fresh
I, Tonya is a three star film buoyed by a couple of five star turns.|Fresh
An alternately delightful and heartbreaking mockumentary romp of a biopic, I, Tonya features a mesmerizing performance by Margot Robbie.|Fresh
"Largely unknown actor Paul Walter Hauser nicks the back half of ""I, Tonya"" as portly Gillooly goon and Harding bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt."|Fresh
A mix of dramatized documentary and hilarious black comedy, I, Tonya is a bitter sweet biopic, with the most and funniest potty mouth dialogue in years.|Fresh
Savagely black, hilariously funny and peppered with an underbelly of pathos, I, Tonya may not deliver the whole truth, but there is no denying the version it presents is wonderfully entertaining.|Fresh
... the result is a thoroughly entertaining and strangely thought-provoking watch.|Fresh
I, Tonya is brash and stirring, all while reflecting sympathetically on this woman's blinkered, bruised life.|Fresh
A surprisingly funny faux documentary with obvious affection for its beleaguered namesake, I, Tonya does what 25 years ago seemed impossible: It makes the derided and even despised Tonya Harding empathetic and human.|Fresh
Speeds along like a graceful figure skater at the top of her game, delivering an entertaining performance that scores high marks both technically and artistically. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sex, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
I, Tonya is a depressing tale. Yet, as superbly acted by a fine cast and confidently directed by Gillespie, it's a weirdly entertaining and even quite tragic story.|Fresh
I, Tonya is a wild and entertaining exploration of one of sport's most controversial figures, spearheaded by excellent performances from the cast.|Fresh
There hasn't been a piece of warped Americana this ugly since the 2003 documentary Capturing the Friedmans. Harding's humanity means less to the filmmakers than does the possibility of her guilt.|Rotten
A surreal and sympathetic portrait of the Olympian skater.|Fresh
The cast is brilliant. Margot Robbie, who learned to skate for the film, nails Harding, while Golden-Globe winner Allison Janney is an acerbic marvel as her mother. Sebastian Stan gives a mostly understated performance as Gillooly.|Fresh
This movie is so compelling. I laughed, I cried, it's really well written.|Fresh
What I, Tonya does even more beautifully than telling Harding's story is how it shines a light on the ugliest aspects of human nature.|Fresh
Finding the human stories underneath what could have easily been caricatured characters, the film also serves as an indictment of each and every one of us who tune into train wreck television, enjoying the shame and suffering of others as entertainment.|Fresh
... I, Tonya really only works because of the sure, merciless strokes in which it sketches its main characters.|Fresh
It didn't live up to what I thought it could hold, but the performances certainly [did]. I think Margot Robbie is looking at an Oscar nomination.|Fresh
I love this movie.|Fresh
... [I, Tonya] has offered Margot Robbie the chance to solidify herself as a great actress. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Not just a fake biopic, a totally fake biopic!|Rotten
The movie (is structured) as purposefully corrupt, darkly comic storytelling, boldly bridging the vast gap between soapy trash and an Akira Kurosawa cinema classic.|Fresh
The best US indie film of 2017.|Fresh
...has a snarkiness that makes me suspicious of it as an empathetic exercise.|Fresh
Director Craig Gillespie has put together quite a film.|Fresh
A frequently hilarious pitch-black comedy about child abuse, domestic violence, athletic talent, bad decisions and whacking a skater on the knee.|Fresh
Gillespie and Rogers have crafted a funhouse mirror of America - the film works as contemporary allegory.|Fresh
As wacky as the movie's tone often is, I Tonya delivers a scathing look at gender and class politics, and the hypocritical fantasyland of professional sports.|Fresh
Regardless, this is the best figure skating movie ever made (sorry, Blades of Glory), even if it's more likely to inspire little girls to flip the bird than take to the ice.|Fresh
Unfortunately, the film never finds its tone, dithering between ironically sympathizing with Tonya and condescending to her.|Rotten
Though it's irresistibly funny and filled with insane (but true) details, this is ultimately a sad story about a woman who was mistreated from day one.|Fresh
... reveals a complex, remarkable athlete who, through her experiences, indicts unfairness in personal and public arenas.|Fresh
Gillespie's movie glides like a drunken skater, contained but changing direction with each tangent and tantrum.|Fresh
"I, Tonya's transparent use of those ""wildly contradictory"" interviews from the leads - recreated throughout the film to provide context and narration - also provides an interesting ambiguity to its ""based on a true story"" status."|Fresh
... while the film doesn't land a triple axel, it's safe to say it doesn't go splat face-first into the ice, either.|Fresh
I don't know how to sort out my feelings about the real Harding, but Robbie and Janney are working at peak form, and I'll tell you this, as well: I, Tonya made me think about all the Tonyas in our culture.|Fresh
If a movie is provocatively challenging the audience's own prejudices, it helps to have a solid cast. Robbie has as much brass as Harding when it comes to taking on the challenge of fleshing out a character.|Fresh
"While Robbie (""Suicide Squad"") doesn't really resemble Harding physically, she embodies her scrappy, foul-mouthed spirit, and her sense of alienation. She may not look like Harding looks, but she looks like Harding felt."|Fresh
What makes it bearable, and maybe even too pleasurable given its cruel content, is Margot Robbie's unrelenting, unpredictable, and entirely uncompromising performance, summarized in three words that capture Harding's truth: IN YOUR FACE!|Fresh
This is not complexity; this is trying to have it both ways.|Rotten
I, Tonya has no right to be as good as it is.|Fresh
Margot Robbie just about lands a triple Axel in a dazzling performance as maligned skater Tonya Harding. Mom (Allison Janney) glides easily into some dark places, too.|Fresh
I, Tonya works hard to make Harding sympathetic, especially compared to her abusive husband (Sebastian Stan) and monstrous mother (a costume-y Allison Janney), but I just felt bad for Nancy Kerrigan all over again.|Rotten
In an excellent, Oscar-worthy performance, Margot Robbie steals the screen as Tonya.|Fresh
It is, in truth, very much worth seeing ... for the most obvious reasons. Quite predictably, Robbie as Harding and Janney as her mother are tremendous.|Fresh
A much ado about nothing movie, I, Tonya retells the true-life tale of the assault on skater Nancy Kerrigan in the winter of 1994.|Rotten
Robbie dives into the role like she's fearlessly attempting a triple axel. It's a rangy role that could have fallen into parody, but Robbie seems to hold a genuine affinity for Harding. This movie would not be what it is without that.|Fresh
For the most part, Gillespie's vibrant filmmaking matches the sheer insanity of the story, a tale which combines a sport that (by design) tends towards melodrama, a soupçon of class warfare and the rise of tabloid TV.|Fresh
[I, Tonya] wants to show the abuse, but suggest that it maaaybe didn't happen that way. To have fun with Tonya and her grotesque mother and her husband's dim-witted friends and then judge us for judging them.|Rotten
[Craig] Gillespie's film is a hilarious, heartrending masterpiece -- a comedy, tragedy and drama of Shakespearean proportions with teased hair and sequins.|Fresh
A brutally honest and caustic treatise on the meaninglessness of truth and identity in a media landscape that can only see in binary, I, Tonya starts with a cough and ends with bloody spittle.|Fresh
Fierce, jaw-dropping|Fresh
The movie's level of confidence and style immediately blows the preconceptions away.|Fresh
"Traces a line from mid-'90s scandal to the scum-encrusted sociopolitical hellscape in which we find ourselves. With head-butt aggression, ""I, Tonya"" addresses insidious issues of class, gender and willful delusion that curdle contemporary culture."|Fresh
The movie is unforgettable, even though you may want to rid your mind of these people as quickly as possible.|Fresh
Built on superb performances from Margot Robbie and Allison Janney, it's a warts-and-all portrait of Harding, but one that is also disarmingly sympathetic and revealing.|Fresh
I, Tonya, is a solid attempt, largely thanks to Margot Robbie's portrayal of a very human, very sympathetic Tonya.|Fresh
We never fully empathize with Tonya because she never fully gains our trust; her smiles could be leers, her obvious need for attention is tempered by a resentment over loss of control over her image.|Fresh
Another manic mother comes forward in Allison Janney's charismatically assured, unsentimentally sewer-mouthed mom to Margot Robbie's gloriously vivid Tonya Harding in Craig Gillespie's brutal, funny, biting, cutting, kicking, snarling I, Tonya.|Fresh
Banned for life, but she was never boring.|Fresh
There are many meaningful lines in Craig Gillespie's self-aware and very funny biopic.|Fresh
Crucially, [Margot] Robbie masters the mousy Harding's crumpled grimace-a mask made of intense chutzpah doing battle with bottomless self-pity.|Fresh
Robbie is taller, bigger than the tiny, fierce Harding, but she gets the athlete's forward drive, and the anger that seemed to fuel the dynamo, and when life hands Tonya lemons, Robbie sets her jaw and bears down.|Fresh
Director Craig Gillespie deftly creates a story full of humor, suspense, and revelatory events, the latter involving such high stakes some viewers may find themselves gasping, cheering, and applauding as if they're, well, attending a sporting event.|Fresh
Robbie, Sebastian, and especially Janney nail their roles.|Fresh
"There is a good film to be made about Tonya Harding, a tragic figure who was unfairly branded ""trailer trash"" and subsequently shunned from the hoity-toity world of figure skating. This is not it."|Rotten
It's not like modern cinema is so bloated with postmodern autocritiques of biopic storytelling that this feels anything but striking and unique.|Fresh
It's puzzling why Gillespie opted to retell Harding's off-told story, but with big assists from Robbie and Janney, he makes it seem new.|Fresh
A stunning performance by Robbie that should gain her a Best Actress nomination. Who could beat Janney's fearless, cruel performance in the Best Supporting category?|Fresh
Robbie gives a commanding comic performance, playing Tonya as a force of talent, determination, spunk and rotten choices. Janney is caustic gold as the swearing, chain-smoking, horrid LaVona.|Fresh
It's still early in the career of Margot Robbie, but Tonya Harding will go down as her current performance to beat, and much like pulling off a triple axle, it won't be easy to surpass.|Fresh
Like its plucky anti-heroine, I, Tonya is full of grit and determination, enough to make it where pedigree, decorum and odds are stacked in opposition.|Fresh
When Hollywood pays attention to blue collar notoriety, there are inevitable accusations of snobbery. But I, Tonya has the ring of absurd truth. The Coen brothers couldn't come up with a better idiot-criminal story.|Fresh
At its core, the film examines performative femininity, toxic masculinity, and the deep-rooted misogyny inherent in both.|Fresh
Gillespie's insistence on comedy in place of what's largely missing from the film - perspective, pathos - falsely energizes the story. It's sped up but feels hollow. A spinning compass whose needle is about to snap.|Rotten
Robbie is amazing in the role, but the main attraction in the movie has to be Allison Janney as Tonya's mother, LaVona.|Fresh
I, Tonya is kitschy and smart and funny and insightful, and sometimes sobering.|Fresh
You will find yourself kind of hating yourself for chuckling, but it is part of the experience and conversation.|Fresh
Robbie delivers a performance that is breathtaking to behold, almost to the point of exhaustion.|Fresh
Takes a rather sordid episode and turns it into a film of goofy humor leavened with some serious drama and a touch of heart.|Fresh
A pointed satire on athletic ambition and class conflict that's fueled by a biting sense of humor and a couple of knockout performances.|Fresh
With a less compelling lead performance, the movie's dodgy limitations and flashy, facile editing and cross-cutting might've proven insufferable.|Fresh
Robbie ... captures both Harding's radiance and the vulnerability of her frayed edges. It's a great performance that can make the movie feel better than it actually is.|Fresh
The movie is a pitch-black comedy, told with a wink and a smirk by unreliable narrators, who include Harding, her mother, and her husband - all presenting self-serving versions of the truth, often standing in arch contrast to the images we are shown.|Fresh
The movie feels at odds with itself, chiding the audience for disrespecting Harding's underprivileged background while at the same time chock full of sight gags sniggering at poor people.|Rotten
The film softens the bouts of cruelty with an abiding sense of humane, if absurdist, comedy, smoothing out the tonal shifts that may have you gasping in horror one minute and laughing the next.|Fresh
Who would have ever imagined Tonya Harding as the subject of a great movie?|Fresh
Every risible moment exposes the filmmaker's class, race and gender contempt-it's camp on ice and the farthest thing from the gay sensibility that contemporary Hollywood sorely lacks.|Rotten
Tonya Harding's familiar scandal makes for an unexpectedly fine black comedy with sensational performances from every member of its cast.|Fresh
Robbie anchors the film with her whole-hearted, emotional performances, making it an entertaining portrait of one of sports' most notorious figures.|Fresh
That the film delivers as many laughs as does insight into such a unique tragedy of errors is testament to its deft balancing act and willingness to not ignore, but engage the contradictions.|Fresh
A black comedy about domestic violence, parental abuse, and low self-esteem (and it works!), one that challenges our appreciation of how true based-on-fact might be.|Fresh
It is a very civilized film about uncivilized people, with flashes of comedy and a good deal of pathos. There is little question it comes down on the side of Tonya Harding, but even less that audiences will do the same.|Fresh
This is a very entertaining film about a very dysfunctional family, and a truly fascinating pair of women, Tonya and her mother LaVona. This is one messed up bunch of people, but they are also the stuff of which great stories are made.|Fresh
"""I, Tonya"" is not only a great American satire, but a revisionist take on an athlete that plays something like ""Rocky"" derailed by ""The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight."""|Fresh
Robbie may not be perfect casting as the rough and ready Harding, but her fierce and generous performance gives Harding a measure of sympathy and grace, even when the movie around her doesn't seem to want to.|Fresh
Tonya's been a punching bag for everyone, including the public. And yes, the film implicates us in that. But her defiance grows with every heckle, including her mother's.|Fresh
I, Tonya is a very complicated story that will have our hearts pulled in five different directions at once. We'll laugh, cry, and be angry on her behalf. And most of all, we'll feel guilty.|Fresh
This remarkable movie-factual and funny, always surprising and unconventionally written, directed and acted-sets the record straight with an adrenalin rush that overwhelms the senses.|Fresh
It's difficult to stay engaged in a work that has so little regard for its subjects.|Rotten
I, Tonya takes a sympathetic look at Tonya Harding's life without glossing over the unpleasant parts of her personality; it doesn't try to excuse her bad behavior, but it does try to understand what led her to behave that way in the first place.|Fresh
One of the wildest, wackiest and most unexpectedly entertaining films of the season|Fresh
Wickedly funny and heartbreakingly dark, I, Tonya ... unearths an antihero whom viewers will find themselves rooting for.|Fresh
Terrific acting and skating (by Robbie herself!); good, tight directing... if you enter the picture with a preconceived notion of Tonya Harding , this will be an eye-opening experience. Hauser's performance as a witless villain sparkles.|Fresh
"""I, Tonya"" inspires a singularly unique emotional response. Viewers will laugh heartily at the decidedly dark humor, but they will also experience pangs of guilt for uncritically accepting the media's demonization of Harding."|Fresh
It's a true balancing act, a tragic comedy in every sense of the term, and it only works as well as it does because Robbie seems possessed with the sort of deep, emphatic connection with the real-life Harding that allows actors to disappear into a role.|Fresh
I, Tonya is one-of-a-kind and definitely rough around the edges, dressed up to awkwardly fit in with the more traditional award season contenders. There's all the ambition, progressiveness, and danger of the triple axel.|Fresh
Robbie makes Tonya so sympathetic that it's easy to gloss over the film's major flaws.|Fresh
An intended black seriocomedy curdles into garish burlesque. The biopic becomes the biohazard.|Rotten
... puts a powerful, post-Monica-Lewinsky-TED-Talk spin on the concept of public shaming.|Fresh
The year's best sports movie is not about football or baseball, soccer or boxing; it's about figure skating and has enough chills to call it a thriller.|Fresh
An uneven biopic that's both violent and funny, and, in the end, surprisingly moving.|Fresh
I, Tonya aims for a different kind of retroactive justice. Gillespie and Rogers argue that Kerrigan actually had chances to shine on an international stage that Harding never got.|Fresh
The film is periodically enlivened by some of the supporting players, including Paul Walter Hauser as Shawn Eckhardt, the supposed mastermind of the Kerrigan assault whom the movie depicts as a world-class schlub.|Fresh
Fact-based dark comedy has strong language, domestic abuse.|Fresh
As a story, it's a frenzy, bizarre even by today's standards, and when Gillespie includes clips of the real-life participants, it's almost a shock that it wasn't fictional.|Fresh
[David Gillespie] has no qualms about ridiculing her larger-than-life family members, but portrays Tonya as an innocent victim, which turns out to be a lopsided, even dull take on this fascinating tale.|Rotten
[A] surprising movie that will make you laugh while your heart breaks a little for Tonya Harding.|Fresh
With its black comedy/raw drama blend, Robbie's gritty, stellar performance plus Janney's Medea of a mom, I, TONYA proves to be one hellava holiday on ice.|Fresh
"""I, Tonya"" is a lot of things, but cohesive isn't one of them, and while it entertains in fits, it's a viewing experience that's only skin-deep."|Fresh
Absurdly funny but tragic fictionalized ice-skater biopic based on a true story.|Fresh
...what Rogers and Gillespie have smartly perceived is... a ravaging class divide which many aspects of American society... both exploit and encourage...|Fresh
Grounded by its documentary style... I, Tonya makes for a fresh take on the biopic/sports genre while audiences are able to learn more about what led Harding down her path.|Fresh
If you're still not convinced that Margot Robbie is more than just a beauty,I, Tonyashould do the trick. I couldn't take my eyes from the screen. Cheers to everyone who collaborated on this first-rate film...and a deep bow to Margot Robbie.|Fresh
Destroyed yet defiant, Robbie walks the emotional tightrope of the most fabulously, tragically American film of the year.|Fresh
Surprisingly sympathetic, grounded, and insightful.|Fresh
"There's a surprising depth to ""I, Tonya,"" too, as the sheer resilience of Harding stirs."|Fresh
A riveting, impressively detailed, frequently hilarious look at a unique form of American idiocy - namely, the misguided belief that it's easy to get away with bad behavior when the spotlight is shining on or near you.|Fresh
Shows Tonya was a fighter, and she still is.|Fresh
"Impressive in its own right, ""I, Tonya"" offers an antidote to those feel-good films about innately noble athletes who manage to triumph over impossible odds."|Fresh
I, Tonya takes greater risks with the biopic genre than any other in recent memory, and it's remarkable how much of it lands upright. It's the triple axel of based-on-true-story movies.|Fresh
Margot Robbie stars as Tonya Harding, and she lights every firecracker at her disposal, giving a truly explosive performance inside a movie that merely pops.|Fresh
Nobody was asking for a film about a trashy tabloid tale from long ago, but everybody is applauding it now.|Fresh
[W]e can see how Tonya becomes a victim of circumstance, of others' abuse, and of her own state of victimhood...|Fresh
You won't just find yourself rooting for this crazy kid; you might even fall a little bit in love.|Fresh
Undeniably funny, a bit obvious, and insightful in ways that work against its subject matter|Fresh
Gillespie may be indebted to filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and David O. Russell, but the character depth and tonal control of their best work seem beyond his reach.|Rotten
Elevated by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney's shimmering performances, this entertaining account of those strange events earns the sort of high marks for creative interpretation that its protagonist complained eluded her.|Fresh
Seeing her navigate the obstacles in her own life makes her brief moment of success all the more impressive, and her eventual downfall that much harder to witness.|Fresh
... I, Tonya is a shockingly stark portrait of what chronic, escalating domestic violence might actually look like.|Fresh
Although the surface tone adopted by I, Tonya is breezy and cheeky, there's a lot going on beneath the facade.|Fresh
An often genius, always subversive film about an outsider who isn't easy to love yet at the same time hard to hate.|Fresh
A vivid slice of pop culture history-an irresistible, soapy mix of jealousy, competition and class warfare, fortified by powerful performances and unexpected emotional resonance.|Fresh
A renegade biopic with punk-rock energy and an in-your-face performance from Robbie.|Fresh
Gillespie walks a fine line in mining both the buffoonish nature of the crime and the deep sadness of Harding's rise and fall, and mostly pulls it off.|Fresh
I, Tonya is the Tonya Harding film you never knew you wanted: an outrageously entertaining reappraisal of the Olympic figure skater who, in 1994, was involved in a scheme to injure her main rival, Nancy Kerrigan.|Fresh
There's a poignancy to Harding's battle against her own bad reputation, and it survives I, Tonya's flippant, needle-drop approach thanks to the rage and resignation of the lead performance.|Fresh
"As ""I, Tonya"" skips here and there and thickens the plot, it becomes increasingly baffling why the filmmakers decided to put a comic spin on this pathetic, dispiriting story."|Rotten
The Tonya Harding biopic is a poignant sports chronicle, a domestic abuse story, and a riotous account of a dumb crime gone wrong. The best stuff, though, is the pure theater of the skating.|Fresh
Offers thoughtful and somewhat objective critiques, plus much seriously dark humor that'll elicit a lot of uncomfortable gasps of laughter - and invites you to ponder difficult truths.|Fresh
Laceratingly funny and unexpectedly empathetic. At once a complex, equal-opportunity biopic, an irreverent satire, and a riveting crime drama.|Fresh
A never-better Robbie and Janney hold up a mirror to the tabloid America most of us ignore or dismiss - and make us see ourselves reflected in it, too. I, Tonya is funny as hell, but the pain is just as real. You'll laugh till it hurts.|Fresh
But I, Tonya survives those production difficulties due to the Shakespearean stakes of its real-life plot, as polar and duetto as Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, or Al Capone and Bugs Moran.|Fresh
Your heart hurts as much as your knee does.|Fresh
Robbie spins, twirls and soars in this magnificently smudged, grandly sympathetic portrait that digs deep into the dirty, damaged roots beneath the tabloid headlines.|Fresh
One of the best movies of the Oscar season...|Fresh
Dives into the swirling narratives surrounding the scandal-prone figure skater, and dredges up something that ultimately, feels real. Shockingly, it also feels redemptive.|Fresh
[A] dazzling cinematic tour de force.|Fresh
It sounds depressing. But the movie - and its stars - tell the story with biting humor and big performances.|Fresh
Robbie is impressive, but Allison Janney steals the movie as Harding's endlessly bitter and bullying mother.|Fresh
The film's pitch-black humor is sharper than that of a skating blade.|Fresh
You'd think this Tonya Harding biopic would turn out to be nothing but an extended punchline, but it's actually a savvy meditation on class, the bull inside the competitive skating world and the dynamics of family abuse.|Fresh
That is where the success of the film lies: it's cast commitment. Because the real-life people and events of this story are so odd, it lends to over the top performances that work.|Fresh
It's a black comedy, and parts of it are too broad, like a second-rate Coen brothers movie. Many of the meta-jokes feel cheap. The story is good enough not to need them.|Fresh
But maybe that point is better served by portraying all of the awfulness in Tonya Harding's life, everything that shaped her, as straightforward tragic happenstance-rather than a gut buster.|Rotten
But while the film sometimes feels busy and scattered, Janney and Robbie are vivid anchors, diving into the kind of complicated, boundary-pushing characters that, let's face it, are usually the domain of men onscreen.|Fresh
Gillespie's empathy is mixed with condescension; much of the movie's bluff comedy mocks the tone and the actions of Tonya and her milieu.|Rotten
It challenges the media's vindictiveness, the 24-hour news cycle of sensationalism, and even gawking moviegoers of being as complicit as the trashy folks who ensnared Tonya into a lifelong trajectory headed downward.|Fresh
I, Tonya is a sucker punch in the gut of the American Dream.|Fresh
Unless you find parental and domestic abuse amusing, Craig Gillespie's glibly fictionalized, bizarre biopic is deeply flawed, just like its ferocious heroine - although Margot Robbie and Allison Janney deliver memorable performances.|Rotten
The film's habit of courting and then insulting the viewer is a conscious nod to the cycles of abuse that mark Harding's story, but the filmmakers' attempts to implicate their audience are I, Tonya's broken shoelace, too pat and glib to be convincing.|Rotten
A wild and raucous biopicture about Tonya Harding who moves too fast on the thin ice of fame and falls.|Fresh
I, Tonya is a must-see film that will make you laugh, cry and cringe.|Fresh
Margot Robbie and Allison Janney deliver their career best performances|Fresh
...a slashing, kickass comedy about class warfare, media manipulation, and one of history's stupidest criminal conspiracies.|Fresh
Pivots the hero's journey and gives the infamous femme fatale her deserved win. It skates away with the gold.|Fresh
Beneath all the gallows humor there's a sadness to I, Tonya. A prevailing sense that if Tonya had just had less terrible people in her life, her path could've been much different and much less tragic.|Fresh
A best-ever performance by Margot Robbie as the gifted and star-crossed athlete Harding and an unforgettable Allison Janney supporting turn as the least-supportive mother of the year.|Fresh
Comedic but pointed in outlook, I, Tonya portrays a woman who had endured constant abuse and dropped out of high school to pursue the only thing she was ever praised for.|Fresh
Successfully balances the tone of this bizarre story, which is horrifying in some respects and darkly hilarious in others (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
..So much of I, Tonya rests on the shoulders of Australian star Margot Robbie, who gives a perfect 10 (or 6.0 in ISU scoring) performance.|Fresh
"In one of the most unconventional biopics to make its way onto our screens in years, Craig Gillespie's darkly comedic yet incredibly moving ""I, Tonya"" is an avalanche of greatness that sustains its high energy and witty beats."|Fresh
"Gillespie clearly takes a page out of the Scorsese rulebook as the DNA of ""Goodfellas"" is imprinted all over his film. There are worse movies to blatantly copy in this day and age and, quite frankly, Gillespie pulls it off"|Fresh
Watch Tonya be a terrible person and then blame YOU, yes, you, direct to camera for judging her all those years ago and thinking she was a terrible person.|Rotten
For some , the talented actors involded will be enough to transcend the problematic way Tonya's story is treated.|Rotten
This is The Tonya Harding Show, and Robbie portrays her with an appropriately DGAF attitude.|Fresh
The neat trick of Gillespie's movie is how he both appreciates the unavoidable buffoonery of Harding's story, and acknowledges the trial that was her life.|Fresh
The most compelling aspects of I, Tonya do not involve pop sociology but instead reside in Janney and Robbie's success in making a half-forgotten scandal relevant in the era of Trump.|Fresh
This mean-spirited biopic provides cheap laughs at the expense of its subjects.|Rotten
The dark comedy approach to the story of Tonya Harding that you had no idea you needed as badly as you do.|Fresh
A de-glamorized Margot Robbie suspends disbelief by putting a triple-axel spin on an iconic villain, generating credible empathy for Tonya Harding as a seriously talented athlete abused by both her idiot husband and the rigged racket of figure skating.|Fresh
It's interested in subjective truths, in class differences, in our national self-image, and in our cultural obsession with scandal and celebrity.|Fresh
Never has a horrific incident been so ripe for biting satire.|Fresh
I, Tonya is a fascinatingly funny look into the life of Tonya Harding. Margot Robbie delivers the best performance of her career while Allison Janney steals every scene.|Fresh
[I, Tonya] is unexpectedly resonant.|Fresh
Its Tonya acquires a untidy grandeur because of her contradictions, not in spite of them, crushing out cigarettes with her skate blade and skipping over inconvenient details the film delves into anyway.|Fresh
Class, competition, and the world's dumbest criminals converge in this pitch black comedy.|Fresh
Gillespie's tone is the right one, but the director was left in the middle without reaching the final consequences. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a film as sharp as the skates Harding wears. Robbie is revelatory, Janney just amazing and the rest of the cast is equal to the task of bringing this amazingly American tale to life.|Fresh
A beautifully made pop-culture pastiche, with the best ensemble cast of the year.|Fresh
"""I, Tonya"" will make you care about Tonya Harding for the first time in a long time. Moreover, ""I, Tonya"" will make you sympathize with Tonya Harding for the first time."|Fresh
[Margot] Robbie strikes the perfect tone between vulnerability and strength as Harding, while [Allison] Janney [is] just [as] ridiculously mean and funny as her mother.|Fresh
I, Tonya succeeds because of the pathos it creates.|Fresh
A blisteringly funny and sympathetic portrait of the Olympian led by an outstanding, confident performance from Margot Robbie.|Fresh
[I, Tonya] ingeniously transforms a maligned villain into a hero we can't help but love.|Fresh
"Superb. The ""Goodfellas"" of figure skating."|Fresh
It's brash and shaggy and while Robbie might not quite stick the landing, Janney's performance is gold.|Fresh
I, Tonya ... gives Robbie the chance - her first, really - to show her full range as an actress. And she shines.|Fresh
From her hair to her loud outfits, Robbie is everything that made you love Harding if you lived through the time when she was one of the most recognizable people on the planet.|Fresh
Like last year's The People v O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, I, Tonya asks us to reconsider what we thought we knew in the 90s and realize that the headlines and the punchlines obscured a darker and more difficult story.|Fresh
I, Tonya spins a convincing yarn despite, or maybe because of, its surfeit of unreliable narrators.|Fresh
A fresh, chancy, and wickedly enjoyable movie.|Fresh
Margot Robbie is a human dynamo as Tonya Harding.|Fresh
