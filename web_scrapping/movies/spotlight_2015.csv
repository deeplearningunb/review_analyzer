Thoughtful, smart and eerily timely in its look at the dangers of blind loyalty, it's easily one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Spotlight is a film that serves the story. It's unfettered filmmaking that is direct and honest and amazingly refreshing in its focus and one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
It's a celebration of dedication and competence. Characters hunch over directories, clippings and files. They compile databases and underline. It's glorious.|Fresh
"The truth is sometimes hard to swallow, but ""Spotlight"" reminds us that we can't turn a blind eye."|Fresh
This is a movie that manages to leave its audience breathless without ever overexerting itself.|Fresh

At a time when there are hardly any essays dedicated to investigative journalism, another survivor, the cinema, has assumed a responsibility that we got rid of a long time ago... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's as blunt as a page of newspaper, bleeding ink.|Fresh
Takes the research, analysis, interviews, red tape, dead ends and backroom politics of investigative journalism and turns it into an art form.|Fresh
Spotlight is not a film about triumph, unlike most movies about the revelation of an ugly truth; it is a film that recognizes triumph as being just a step on the way to the next battle.|Fresh
Spotlight serves as a genuine reminder to all journalists (whether they are doing actual important research or just writing about entertainment) that the effort and quality of their work should be the primary focus|Fresh
Journalism is the hero here and this film is a compelling, impassioned and nostalgic glimpse of the work and time it requires.|Fresh
British audiences need to know is that it's very American, emotionally tough going and, at times, rather difficult to follow. But none of this stops it being an important film -- and a pretty good one too.|Fresh
Hands down the best movie I've seen at TIFF, Spotlight is a phenomenal film, absolutely pitch perfect from start to finish.|Fresh
Less compelling in its moralizing, Spotlight is propelled by the dictates of the procedural genre, which director Tom McCarthy nails with reportorial efficiency.|Fresh
"There is no ""I"" in team, but we need to start spotlighting the reality that, more often than not, it requires coordinated effort to achieve massive aims. Now that's the whole truth and nothing but."|Fresh
Equal parts engaging, emotional and enlightening. It just shows the importance of a great script and even better storytelling.|Fresh
If there is any heroism in Spotlight then it's a very humble one: the heroism of getting the facts right, which seems, today, almost too much to ask of mainstream newspapers.|Fresh
The true standout is [Mark] Ruffalo, building on his work in Zodiac and making a forceful case for pavement-pounding reporting in a world that favors infotainment over journalism that can lead to justice and reform.|Fresh
Scenes of these newspaper men and women pounding on people's doors, working their sources, alternately cajoling and threatening to get to the bottom of the story becomes strangely thrilling.|Fresh
Director Tom McCarthy, who also co-wrote the script, knows exactly what he's doing. Even his throw-aways make a point.|Fresh
The fact-based film is an engrossing, relevant, finely underplayed, and ultimately heartbreaking crime mystery.|Fresh
The shocking truths that are slowly and painfully revealed throughout the course of the movie make for some pretty suspenseful viewing.|Fresh
The other great thing about Spotlight is that it never shouts out its message. McCarthy employs the secret every good reporter knows: Let the facts speak for themselves, and they will make your story worth the audience's time.|Fresh
By simply presenting a true story in its most raw form, it ends up being an entirely believable portrayal of one of the most important cases of the past 20 years.|Fresh
It's as a scrupulous whole that Spotlight truly shines as one of the year's finest and most compelling dramas.|Fresh
Spotlight is a gripping drama able to stand alongside Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men and a welcome return to form for director Tom McCarthy.|Fresh
The subtle, egoless performances by the cast frees the audience up to invest in the facts of the story, which McCarthy insists take precedent over the characters.|Fresh
It's a far more realistic version of journalism than is often portrayed. And yet it's easy to imagine aspiring journalists watching the film being fired with a passion to work on in-depth exposes.|Fresh

Bold, audacious and shocking, a consummate piece of work.|Fresh

The true stand-out is the story itself, and McCarthy wisely ensures this is so, painting a picture of systemic corruption and abuse that is miraculously, usefully bald.|Fresh
Spotlight appears to tick all the boxes as far as the true-life awards-season investigation drama goes... It makes a few choices you aren't expecting, though, and I can't figure out whether or not this elevates it.|Fresh

A trenchant, if slow and careful, retelling of one of The Boston Globe's greatest scoops.|Fresh
There could be no more fitting hymn to in-depth print-based investigative reporting than Tom McCarthy's riveting, fact-based journalism procedural, Spotlight.|Fresh
Spotlight giving center stage to unsung warriors for truth who understood telling the story right, without embellishment, without melodramatic editorial excess, was the greatest victory of them all.|Fresh
Ultimately, the story these journalists chased was about how institutional power degrades when it gets taken for granted.|Fresh
Spotlight is an impressive film, not so much for any particular twists or turns in the plot, which at this stage is public record, but rather for the impressive humanity and commitment of the performances from a top-notch cast.|Fresh
Shattered Glass is still the best movie about journalists I've ever seen, but Spotlight is definitely the best movie about journalism.|Fresh
As a tribute to rigorous, unglamorous, old-fashioned journalism, Spotlight is only more powerful for being released in the age of disposable digital media.|Fresh
Director Tom McCarthy... knows how to make the little big, but here he makes the big little-human, with confidence and grace. This is a terrific movie.|Fresh

Now *this* is more the Tom McCarthy (Director) we know and love...|Fresh
This is an important film driven by a powerful, almost palpable, sense of moral urgency. It's also, not incidentally, an elegy for what newspapers used to be.|Fresh
Spotlight has many dramatic opportunities to break wide open into moments of outrage, but they're infrequently taken, and keyed to the tensions of characters.|Fresh
Its victories are incremental and its anger against a system that wilfully hid the terrible crimes is present but rarely allowed to manipulate the narrative.|Fresh
Forensically written and directed with restraint, it's a film of huge social importance -- never sensationalistic, always spot on.|Fresh
It restores my faith in the concept of redemption to see McCarthy bouncing from The Cobbler straight to Spotlight|Fresh

There are fine ensemble performances from McAdams, John Slattery, Paul Guilfoyle and Stanley Tucci, but Michael Keaton is Spotlight's secret weapon.|Fresh

Spotlight, a brilliant new film, will shake you out of your complacency and renew your faith in the power of investigative journalism.|Fresh
Spotlight is an advertorial for journalistic objectivity and integrity in the face of abject perversion.|Fresh
One of the year's most noteworthy Oscar contenders and a brilliant ensemble piece.|Fresh
Near-breathless high-tension performances from a fully immersed ensemble, each member conveying an unflagging determination to unveil the breadth of degeneracy.|Fresh
An iconoclastic drama that makes a convincing argument in support of the incendiary axiom, 'The closer to Church, the further from God.'|Fresh
Succeeds because it puts the audience alongside the reporters, allowing us to share the incredulity, disgust and frustration.|Fresh
...the kind of film that takes on the Big Subject with modesty and self-reflection, drawing the viewer into the world of the reporters and culture of Boston in 2001 to better understand the scope of everything that's at stake.|Fresh
It's an intricate web, but when it's finally untangled, a remarkable and striking picture emerges. Spotlight is that picture.|Fresh
Despite having an important story to tell, and a top-notch cast to tell it with, Spotlight is a film that never comes to life thanks to a less-than-compelling narrative that turns the film into a bit of a slog to get through.|Rotten
While it doesn't delve as deep into its subjects as one might hope, Spotlight is a zippy, taut, and mightily distracting film.|Fresh
A film in which an ensemble cast of characters work to defeat a seemingly unstoppable enemy, Spotlight is a bit like an anti-superhero movie, where spreadsheets win the day instead of laser vision.|Fresh

The uniformly strong ensemble cast largely avoids any grandstanding moments, and manufactured drama is swerved, while Howard Shore's sober score is applied with restraint.|Fresh
Spotlight is a celebration of the freedom of the press, a riveting story of investigative journalism and of the role played by The Boston Globe in bringing to public attention the terrible crimes that had been taking place in the city for decades.|Fresh
This film demonstrates that you don't need guns to make an exciting thriller. Based on a true story, this is a journalistic procedural following a team of newspaper writers who take on a corrupt system.|Fresh

This is the story of the Pulitzer prize-winning team of Boston Globe journalists who early in 2002 lifted the lid on a clerical abuse epidemic in the Boston archdiocese.|Fresh
Decently, it focuses on the victims, and why there continued to be victims for so long.|Fresh
Spotlight exists to shine a searchlight on a moment from history that human behaviour tragically refuses to leave consigned to the past.|Fresh
It has a subtle but unsparing aesthetic; the most powerful camera shot is to slowly pull back from a busy desk, silently indicating the story's terrible breadth.|Fresh
This is narrative film-making stripped of unnecessary detail or fabricated sentiment, and it's all the better for it: Spotlight is absorbing and revelatory.|Fresh
With the story's result already known, much of the suspense comes from seeing the characters' slowly dawning realisation of just how big this story is; the matter-of-fact way the pieces of the puzzle come together.|Fresh
Spotlight is, without question, one of the best films of the year and a hands-down must-see.|Fresh
A gripping and exciting thriller - no mean feat considering the action mostly revolves around an elaborate paper chase in locales as exotic as newspaper archives, libraries and legal offices teaming with stacks of documents.|Fresh
How rare is this? A true story so much worth the telling that it needs no embellishment, no sideshow?|Fresh
"The picture manages to avoid the cliches of the genre by refusing to lionise its ""crusaders"" or demonise the villains and is all the more authentic and powerful for it."|Fresh
Spotlight is the kind of completely absorbing film that makes you think, makes you feel and keeps you on the very edge of your seat.|Fresh
With McCarthy dialling it down in the director's chair, it's left to the players to provide the fireworks and they duly rise to the challenge.|Fresh
The sense we have is of dedicated professionals getting the job done with the minimum of egotism or indulgence.|Fresh
Powerful, absorbing and deeply moving, Spotlight is almost certainly the best film about journalism of at least the past decade. Probably more.|Fresh
The film is immaculately controlled: a work of restraint that nevertheless has a real kick to it. I'll eat my hat if there's been a better newspaper film since 1976's All the President's Men.|Fresh
The energetic ensemble cast...lend a moral urgency to the story, though writer/director Tom McCarthy is savvy enough to temper the heroism with the revelation that they were approached years earlier with the same information and did nothing.|Fresh
Electrifying, enthralling and utterly essential, here's a drama that engages both head and heart with the best David versus Goliath story since Erin Brockovich.|Fresh
This is a worthy film on an important subject, but it just does not fly.|Rotten
One of the best films you will see this - or any - year, Spotlight grips like a vice from start to finish.|Fresh

McCarthy is dealing with grim subject matter but the film has the momentum of a well-told detective thriller.|Fresh

...dismal...made without a thought of pace...I was expecting another 'All the President's Men,' but this misses the mark on all points, including the failure to adequately indict the Church for its abominable actions.|Rotten
Much has been said about the banality of evil. Spotlight shows the nightmare that can spring from cops, teachers, lawyers, judges and bureaucrats just doing their jobs.|Fresh
Riveting from its first second to its last. With a smart script, perfectly paced direction, and superb acting, this is a work that manages to be as entertaining as it is important.|Fresh

A gripping story of investigative journalism.|Fresh
"""Spotlight"" is not only gripping but a great introduction to Journalism 101, making it easily the best ""newspaper"" film since ""All the President's Men."""|Fresh
McCarthy captures emotion with subtlety, which in return is beneficial when the actors carry around a plethora of mannerism for hidden meaning.|Fresh
The re-creation of the local atmosphere adds credibility to the star power ... At its most stripped down and plainspoken, Spotlight allows the record to speak for itself.|Fresh
The spotlight is unforgiving and shines on everyone, from the Church to the reporters. No place to hide.|Fresh
It's just a stunning look at professionals doing a job most people would run from and doing it very well.|Fresh
A taut story well-told, suspenseful despite the fact that the world knows how it all turned out, and energized by an authentic sense of the dogged research and footwork at the heart of serious investigative journalism.|Fresh
The movie is essentially a procedural; it never detours from the investigation to spend time with a priest or a victim at home. Spouses and significant others are mentioned but rarely seen; domestic drama is more or less irrelevant.|Fresh
Spotlight is one of the great journalism films; compelling, flawlessly acted, and successful in its invitation to join in the hunt for the truth.|Fresh
"""Spotlight"" makes you long for the days of real investigative journalism, when reporters got their facts straight, and exposes were only written when they could be corroborated."|Fresh
Its extraordinary cast keeps us riveted to the screen in an authentic portrayal of investigative journalism.|Fresh
Now 'Steve Jobs' has a competitor for Best Picture.|Fresh
Sharp and flawlessly performed.|Fresh
It's about the rewards of hard work and a dedication to truth. Even without fireworks and firefights, it's immensely satisfying to watch.|Fresh
[McCarthy] scales up to a wide-ranging ensemble piece and gives it the unstoppable momentum of a boulder bounding down a steep hill.|Fresh
"This idea of ""enough"" forms the thematic spine... It's an idea that becomes increasingly complicated, in the many relationships forged here, between sources and reporters, reporters and editors, attorneys and political figures, victims and criminals."|Fresh
The filmmakers and cast are careful to focus on the drudgery, dead ends and shoe leather that go into an enterprise of this scale, eschewing sensationalism. Of the film's 128 minutes, not one is wasted on self-righteous grandstanding or speech making.|Fresh
There's a flatly functional artlessness to the visuals. Spotlight is drab, sometimes bordering on ugly. It may be a film worth seeing, but there isn't much to look at.|Rotten
Don't miss this crackling - and deeply important - film about the power of the press.|Fresh
Briskly paced and never breaking its stare with the evil it confronts, Spotlight is a wire-to-wire home run.|Fresh
Tom McCarthy is the best humanistic filmmaker in movies today.|Fresh
Works as history, as justification for the value of real journalism and as a still relevant cautionary tale on the perils of willful ignorance.|Fresh
McCarthy's screenplay keeps things moving at a furious pace, so that it feels like an action movie with a time bomb ticking in the background.|Fresh
Spotlight is especially admirable in its restraint, not only in its approach to unsettling material but also in the acting by all concerned ... If it isn't quite the match of the peerless All the President's Men, we have to remind ourselves, what is?|Fresh
Spotlight is a well-crafted and thoughtful investigative docudrama that is buoyed by great performances.|Fresh
Spotlight is a tight, economical model of understated craft.|Fresh
One thing I noticed early on when watching this film was how strongly it draws you into the story. It really hooks you, and as an example of investigative journalism, this is as good as it gets.|Fresh
Everyone plays their part and plays it extremely well, but it's ultimately about serving the story over a particular character.|Fresh
Spotlight might very well be the best film of the year. It's an intense and well-crafted ensemble drama that has and will receive near-universal accolades and repeated mentions as an Oscar frontrunner.|Fresh
Spotlight may make the results of old-school reporting look heroic, but it also makes that work look human.|Fresh
Simply put, one of the best -- if not THE best -- movies of the year.|Fresh
The film takes the dogged, persistent, mundane work of old school newspaper reporting - digging through records, interviewing people, connecting dots - and makes it the stuff of high drama, exciting and even heroic.|Fresh
Plunges us into the rhythms of a specific time and place: Boston around the turn of the millennium, at a time when...the extent of the cover-up culture in the Church had not yet been exposed.|Fresh
"Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" is a movie that doesn't have to raise its voice. Much like the reporters it focuses on, this is an assured work, firm in its convictions, telling its story in a factual, non-exploitive way..."|Fresh
"The Catholic Church and its infamous pedophile clerics go under the microscope of a crack reporting team in a detail-oriented gem that's right up there with the brilliant newspaper-movie likes of ""All the President's Men"" and ""Absence of Malice."""|Fresh
The closing notes, crafted beautifully by McCarthy and Josh Singer's screenplay and rendered flawlessly by McCarthy's quietly observant lens, remind even the most vigilant of us all that this is not a past-tense issue|Fresh
The movie, deftly directed by Tom McCarthy, from a script he wrote with Josh Singer, arouses many emotions, for journalists and non-journalists alike: outrage, shock, horror, disbelief, grief, disgust.|Fresh
Movies about journalism are rarely this authentic, let alone this gripping.|Fresh
McCarthy captures the flow of information around a major newsroom, back in the days when papers had the luxury to pay for year-long investigations by a four-person staff that worked on nothing else.|Fresh
The subject already provokes rage and/or revulsion without having to endure a step-by-step procedural. But this stark and effective prestige picture makes the experience palatable by approaching the material with journalistic tenacity.|Fresh
Spotlight is a great newspaper movie, ranking up there with All the President's Men and Citizen Kane, and it's certainly the best of its kind since The Paper in 1994.|Fresh
"The best film about journalism since ""All the President's Men."" And the most important."|Fresh
The actors manage to turn sitting and listening (along with asking questions and requesting documents) into riveting drama.|Fresh
The highest compliment I can pay Spotlight: I would watch this on TV.|Fresh
The movie works so well because it focuses on the efforts of a team of reporters to uncover a huge, nightmarish scandal. It's all about the process, and it never forgets that it's all about the process.|Fresh
[A] neatly accomplished movie.|Fresh
'Spotlight' avoids sensationalism, telling its lurid story in a low-key, even-keeled manner. It is by far the best movie about investigative journalism since 'All the President's Men.'|Fresh
... like All the President's Men there's nothing to spoil, much to admire. And, like Pakula's movie, Spotlight will likely figure into journalism school syllabi for as long as anyone enrolls.|Fresh
rather than merely recounting the painstaking detective work involved, it examines a system more concerned with institutions than people, powered by people convinced that the obfuscation and cover-ups were for the greater good|Fresh
"""Spotlight"" is a labored reportage procedural that arrives a decade too late."|Rotten
Like the story being reported within the film, Spotlight is simultaneously emotional and clear-eyed. It's an explosive yet necessary piece of journalism in and of itself. And it's easily one of the year's best.|Fresh
Succeeds as a 'journalism movie,' but also as much more: An acting showcase, a character study and as a study of the city of Boston itself. (Fox 29 Philly)|Fresh
Director Tom McCarthy creates cinematic tension by setting two institutions on a collision course as the Catholic Church and The Boston Globe wrestle arrogance and ego while professing human compassion.|Fresh
"It may even be the best newspaper movie since ""All the President's Men,"" although its conspiracy story cuts deeper - molested children rather than crooked politicians - and its villain (the Catholic Church) more dangerous."|Fresh
[A] taut, quietly thrilling investigative procedural, each scene a small marvel of solid writing and acting.|Fresh
Spotlight creates excitement from the day-to-day business of recognizing uncomfortable facts.|Fresh
A brilliant, absorbing film.|Fresh
"...defined by Keaton's blah, button-down shirts and McAdams' grown-out roots."""|Fresh
This kind of meat-and-potatoes ensemble drama is rarely made so well (or at all) nowadays, and the ensemble cast is top-notch, with great, unshowy direction from Tom McCarthy.|Fresh
A touching ode to the old-fashioned notion that some things simply need reporting; never mind the effort, the expense, or the effect on circulation.|Fresh
"""Spotlight"" is basically everything the film""Truth"" set out to be but just came up short in accomplishing."|Fresh
Spotlight is a mystery, a thriller and a human interest drama, but mostly it's a love letter to investigative journalism.|Fresh
"A terrific film that will likely remind many a viewer -- if old enough or a big film fan -- of ""All the President's Men."" (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - for Parents also available)"|Fresh
A remarkably assured and tight retelling of the Boston Globe's investigation into the Catholic Church's legacy of child abuse and cover-ups.|Fresh
Really captures the culture of a newsroom, the stale coffee, the stale-er jokes, but the passionate curiosity that drives them all.|Fresh
"It's not a stretch to suggest that ""Spotlight"" is the finest newspaper movie of its era, joining ""Citizen Kane"" and ""All the President's Men"" in the pantheon of classics of the genre."|Fresh
"Though ""Spotlight"" is definitely a reporter-as-hero story (and, along the way, a bittersweet love letter to the kind of investigative journalism that's increasingly disappearing), the film doesn't let its characters off the hook."|Fresh
Inspiring stuff, the stuff of Hollywood all the way back to Frank Capra and before: a story of scrappy underdogs, determined to get to the truth, and toppling the mighty in the process.|Fresh
It tells a tremendous story of journalism from behind the scenes; creates vibrant, well-acted characters, inhabited by terrific actors; and truly reminds us of the value and importance of journalism, and its place in our society.|Fresh
This is a film that not only understands the journalistic process but also respects it enough to delve into the particulars.|Fresh
It's one of the best movies I've ever seen about the art and the science of newspaper reporting|Fresh
For a story of such monumental scope, which asks some awfully big questions about what constitutes good, writer/director Tom McCarthy seems finely attuned to minor, but infinitely human, moments.|Fresh
I watched Spotlight in awe of the raw power that McCarthy's restrained, meticulously measured direction generates from his ruthlessly tight screenplay, with Josh Singer.|Fresh
IIt's important and it's gripping.|Fresh
Spotlight doesn't wallow in the glory of old-media ethics or lament the ongoing death of newspapers, but the movie quietly celebrates the rigorous standards of journalism that are dissipating in this era of click-baiting and Twitter outrage.|Fresh
It's a great story about getting the story.|Fresh
The movie finds drama, not in telling the audience what it doesn't know, but in showing us people finding out the scope and dimension of what we already know, and then letting us see them react with shock, horror and a firm sense of purpose.|Fresh
One of the best real-life tales of investigative journalism since 'All the President's Men.'|Fresh
"At the beginning of Spotlight, a title card proclaims ""based on actual events,"" a tactic many films use to manufacture authenticity even if it's never earned. Here, it feels absolutely right."|Fresh
Should be called brilliant by anyone, regardless of where they work.|Fresh
A special experience, a movie that matters.|Fresh
"Let's cut to the chase: ""Spotlight"" is a flat-out great movie."|Fresh
Spotlight tells a crucial story of morals that still resonates amid continued injustices.|Fresh
One of the most accurate depictions of journalism put on film, perhaps even the finest example we've seen yet. It's easily one of 2015's best films.|Fresh
Smart and stinging, Spotlight excels not only in depicting the stonewalling around the scandal but also the double-talk conversations from within and without the Globe that don't say-but don't not say-'Don't go there.'|Fresh
"McCarthy (""Win Win,"" ""The Visitor"") and his co-writer, Josh Singer (""The Fifth Estate""), smartly focus on the boots-on-the-ground reporting of the Globe's Spotlight team, as it follows lead upon lead to sniff out the biggest scandal in the city's history."|Fresh

This time out the reporters focus on all the Cardinal's men, and they do it brilliantly.|Fresh
"""Spotlight"" is terrific... and certainly ranks as one of the best films of the year!"|Fresh

Spotlight is a rare journey into cinematic journalism that gets at the heart of its investigators' subject without grandstanding the personalities or personal lives of those doing the poking around.|Fresh
Remember newspaper movies? Here's a great one.|Fresh

Like any good reporting job, Spotlight slowly builds momentum from nothing, gathering disparate bits of information into an emotional juggernaut of a story.|Fresh
Spotlight is all about the importance of getting the story absolutely right.|Fresh
Though worth seeing, the film's energy suffers from brownout ... sometimes a surge, sometimes a flicker.And nowhere near the neighborhood of McCarthy's earlier, marvelous work.|Fresh
No need to bury the lede: Spotlight is a masterpiece.|Fresh
Tom McCarthy...shows a deft hand in directing his huge ensemble cast and telling the riveting story which feels, often times, like a police procedural as the case unfolds and expands.|Fresh
It's the year's best movie so far, and a rarity among countless dramatizations that claim to be based on actual events. In this one the events ring consistently-and dramatically-true.|Fresh

The movie's an ensemble piece, building up its characters slowly and carefully, giving each actor a chance to shine. More importantly, it's a movie that's invested in listening.|Fresh
"""Spotlight"" is mightily impressive not only because of the importance of the story it tells but also because of how much effort and skill went into bringing it to the screen in the best possible way."|Fresh
McCarthy is just as shrewd at evaluating the practical morality of attorneys: white collars as well as clerical collars fall into patterns that perpetuate evil. McCarthy has cast his legal roles with actors who can sound psychological depths on the run.|Fresh
Every actor rises to the occasion.|Fresh
Spotlight is an exceptional slow burn, fueled by a consistently in-sync ensemble of actors pulling their weight on all fronts.|Fresh
Spotlight is prestige fare that's quiet rather than flashy, treating its content and characters with a measure of respect rarely seen among industry biopics of its caliber.|Fresh
This tautly directed, terrifically acted movie springs from a Boston Globe investigation a decade ago that led to hundreds of incidents of abuse - in reality, an entire perverted culture - being hauled out into the sanitizing glare of daylight.|Fresh
An emotional tour de force.|Fresh
Like All The President's Men, it's a muckraker movie that celebrates the power of the press by actually showing journalists doing their job, pen and notebook in hand.|Fresh
The year is not over, but I've already seen my favorite film of 2015.|Fresh
"""Spotlight"" is a gripping detective story and a superlative newsroom drama, a solid procedural that tries to confront evil without sensationalism."|Fresh

What we have before us is a case study on how to do shoe-leather cinema-and smart, A-list American moviemaking-right.|Fresh
A landmark film about investigative journalism and the year's most thrilling detective story. Keaton and Ruffalo lead a cast of exceptional actors who could not be better or more fully committed.|Fresh
The film hums as a tense shoe-leather procedural and a heartbreaking morality play that handles personal stories respectfully without losing sight of the bigger, more damning picture.|Fresh
While Tom McCarthy's beautifully crafted film about the Boston Globe investigation of the sex abuse in the Church is very much of a time and place, it also couldn't be more important now.|Fresh
Tom McCarthy's movie doesn't turn its journalists into heroes. It just lets them do their jobs, as tedious and critical as those are, with a realism that grips an audience almost in spite of itself.|Fresh
"Unlike an ongoing investigation, we know the outcome here already. The trick of Spotlight is making the potentially unsexy ""how they got there"" into not only one of the best movies of the year, but one of the best journalism movies of all time."|Fresh

Spotlight feels both timeless and modern, a dexterously crafted film that could have been made anytime but somehow feels perfect for right now.|Fresh
By modeling its structure so closely after All the President's Men, Spotlight only draws closer attention to its lack of scope and ambition.|Rotten
[Its] willingness to question conventional beliefs is just one of the factors that sets Spotlight apart from typical Hollywood fare.|Fresh
McCarthy is tackling something more basic than paranoia-namely, pride of place, and the way in which it offers both an embrace and a choke hold.|Fresh
Taut and compelling, illuminating a timely, still-relevant issue...|Fresh
An iconoclastic drama that makes a convincing argument in support of the incendiary axiom, 'The closer to Church, the further from God.'|Fresh
A tedious bore. The cast chews up the scenery with twitchy acting trying to put energy into the plodding script.|Rotten
Spotlight is about the power of investigative journalism, about the good that it can do, but it is also quite clearly about the evil that men -- and institutions -- can do.|Fresh
At its heart, Spotlight is an argument against deference to authority, which informs so much great journalism.|Fresh
This offers a potent reminder that investigative journalism is critical to a just society, and that we need it now more than ever.|Fresh
Spotlight is the best film yet from Tom McCarthy, a testament to his evolving skills as a director and writer and his eye for the emotional resonance at the core of the stories he tells.|Fresh

Spotlight is a serious film, both artistically and morally, and it wrestles with explosive content while never feeling exploitative or self-aggrandizing.|Fresh
As scripted by McCarthy and Josh Singer, the film succeeds first and foremost in bringing order to an extremely complex piece of team reporting.|Fresh
What the film gets brilliantly right is how journalists can get co-opted by the institutions they cover when their interests converge. And just how much courage it takes to pursue a story that may alienate many of your readers .|Fresh
Succeeds in making what should be the least interesting aspect of the story as interesting as the story itself.|Fresh

Virtually everything that needs to click into place does so with refined precision.|Fresh
McCarthy's sharp, incisive, quietly moving drama tells a knotty story with boundless intelligence, wit, and insight.|Fresh
McCarthy takes the approach perfected by All The President's Men, riding along with the reporters as they sift through names and documents and interview victims, gradually discovering its obscene scale.|Fresh

It's that all-too-rare beast: a movie that's both important and engrossing.|Fresh

Charting the Boston Globe's Pulitzer Prize-winning exposure of widespread abuse of children by Catholic priests, this terrific film should be in the running for its own writing prizes, among others, come awards season.|Fresh
The cast, tasked with delivering all this information and making it feel natural, are remarkable, investing sometimes just the tiniest glances or the shortest of lines with an acreage of personality.|Fresh
The capable main actors don't have much to do except chase leads around town and interview those willing to talk; there's no depth given to these reporters.|Rotten
Capably and decently tells an important story.|Fresh
Although director and co-writer Tom McCarthy can fall victim to prestige-picture preciousness and narrative conventionality, Spotlight goes a long way on the strength of superior acting and a crackling tale.|Fresh
A superbly controlled and engrossingly detailed account of the Boston Globe's Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into the widespread pedophilia scandals and subsequent cover-ups within the Catholic Church.|Fresh
