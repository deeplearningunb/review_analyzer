The definitive David Lean movie.|Fresh
Robert Bolt's intelligent screenplay captures a portrait of a fiendishly complex, hopelessly idealistic individual and explores the politics at play.|Fresh
It combines an astute character study with some of the most jaw-dropping images captured on film.|Fresh
The second half isn't quite as compelling as the first, but to paraphrase a comment I once heard regarding another film: The first half is pure perfection, and then it devolves into one of the best movies ever made.|Fresh
It has an epic hero whom it doesn't hero-worship...[O'Toole] brings flawlessly to life the film's vision of a flawed warrior who is corrupted by pride, soured by empty victories and betrayed finally by the jubilant jump of his heart every time he kills.|Fresh
"[VIDEO ESSAY] Celebrated British director David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a textbook example of ""epic"" cinema."|Fresh
This is movie-making on the grandest scale.|Fresh
Despite the film's technical wizardry, the seven Academy Awards and the expansive budget, this time-honored epic is ultimately a testament to something elemental: the ability to make an audience gasp as a story is told.|Fresh
If epics are your thing, they don't come much grander.|Fresh
Of all miracles readily apparent on screen, perhaps the greatest is that the film even got made in the first place.|Fresh
How did David Lean and star Peter O'Toole achieve such perfection? If we could define and distil it, we wouldn't need a special category for those flicks we call 'classics.' Lawrence of Arabia is that, and then some.|Fresh
This is a movie with the excitement of a cavalry charge.|Fresh
To appreciate the film fully, Lawrence must be seen in a cinema, in 70mm on the widescreen and in stereophonic sound, and the present theatrical revival is not to be missed.|Fresh

Deathless, and looking as good as new.|Fresh

O'Toole, all piercing blue eyes and steadfast idealism, buzzes with charisma in the role of a lifetime.|Fresh

The only way to properly see Lean's overstuffed epic is on the big screen, the better to appreciate the glorious desert vistas, Maurice Jarre's soaring score and the glowing performance by then-unknown Peter O'Toole as a messianic T.E. Lawrence.|Fresh

one of those rare films that runs on all cylinders|Fresh
We remember the quiet, empty passages, the sun rising across the desert, the intricate lines traced by the wind in the sand.|Fresh
If one can continue to see a work such as this 35 years later and still remain entranced by its spectacle and its drama, then surely, that is a classic indeed.|Fresh
There are great action scenes, and the photography by Lean regular Freddie Young is, I believe, is the best ever put on film.|Fresh
Lawrence luxuriates in the tremendous.|Fresh
The only thing that really dates it is the awful makeup, orangey pancake for Lawrence, a gray-green nose for Quinn and cordovan shoe polish for Guinness.|Fresh
This is that rare film whose weaknesses are not only swallowed up by its vast, disturbing ambition, but somehow become part of its strengths.|Fresh
Lawrence is too emotionally overpowering for critical reservations.|Fresh
