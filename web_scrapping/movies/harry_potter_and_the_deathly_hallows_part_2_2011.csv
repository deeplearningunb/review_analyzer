For 10 years and eight films we've gotten to watch these young actors grow as people, as performers and as characters. It has been a true coming-of-age saga, in the fullest and most moving sense of the term.|Fresh
The grand finish, if not always inspired, feels necessary. In a sustained, imaginative way, this is the best of any movie series.|Fresh
Fiennes and Rickman get the actorly moments they've been building toward for so long, and the film is most fun when it sticks to mechanics: roller coaster rides, battle scenes, close calls.|Fresh
In the 10 years since Harry's first big- screen close-up, the spell has never been broken. And we Muggles have been made better for the magic.|Fresh
It's a pleasant irony that, just as the first installments of Rowling's oeuvre were better suited to page than screen, the final installments have reversed the relationship.|Fresh
"When the movie was over, a young boy sitting behind me said, ""That was great!"" He was satisfied, and rightly so."|Fresh
This final chapter of the beloved franchise is a satisfying end to the series, even if it falls short of the promise teased in its slightly superior predecessor.|Fresh
It's true it is very different from the book... Nevertheless, I like this movie. I think it ends the series in a very satisfying way.|Fresh
I was impressed with the incredible amount of edge-of-your-seat action, the brilliant ways in which they worked the 3D F/X in, and just the way the whole thing came together.|Fresh
To those who have loved this journey throughout, it seems a perfect last look at this magical world with a human heart.|Fresh
"""Words are the most powerful magic,"" Dumbledore says in this film. But words must be spoken by people, and the incredible cast assembled here make magic one last time for what will surely be an appreciative audience."|Fresh
David Yates finally gives us the Harry Potter film we have been waiting for; a beautifully shot, incredibly loyal final chapter that mixes heartfelt emotion, strong performances and miraculous action.|Fresh
Like the very best fairy tales, Harry Potter offers us a burning vision of our own world, with goodness and evil helpfully labeled.|Fresh
The effects and acting are top notch, with a vast cast providing well-developed background characters.|Fresh
The danger is seething as both sides battle between extravagant set pieces and eye-catching special effects.|Fresh
Deathly Hallows part 2 struck all the right notes of action, adventure, friendship, courage and love.|Fresh
We're left just as we should be, spellbound in darkness, with our Harry Potter 3-D glasses.|Fresh
Certainly Hollywood will circle back to this beloved fantasy series, but it's hard to imagine that any future film adaptations could be more lovingly crafted, or more beloved by fans.|Fresh
Not the most exciting film of the series, but Yates manages to establish the mature, sombre tone needed to lead into the final film.|Fresh
The final instalment, Deathly Hallows Part 2, is a bravura duel between good and evil. It's also a cathartic, occasionally clunky nostalgiafest.|Fresh
Come the conclusion, tears no doubt will be shed, probably by those more devoted than I. Whether they cry because of overwhelming emotion or in mourning an era's end, I'm not sure. Probably both.|Fresh
Radcliffe retains an endearingly owlish demeanor. But he also captures the quiet determination of a young man determined to confront his life-or-death destiny -- making the world safe for good folks, wizards and Muggles alike -- with admirable aplomb.|Fresh
It's a bittersweet end as the final adaptation of the beloved books hits the big screen. Expect tears, both from nostalgia and some truly amazing storytelling.|Fresh
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is a fine finish to a franchise that most, including myself, wish would never end.|Fresh
It comes to an end with class, dignity and a fair amount of relief on the part of yours truly.|Fresh
Goodbye, Harry. You certainly know how to make an exit.|Fresh
The most enduring aspect of the Harry Potter films, and the reason this one works, is the acting of its three young leads.|Fresh
It unspools like gangbusters.|Fresh
It certainly went out making its presence felt, but in my opinion, though there were explosions aplenty, a few deaths, and everyone inevitably ended up with who they should, I felt it ended with more of a fizz than a bang.|Rotten
The film is strong enough to have the unusual effect of improving its predecessors in the memory simply by association.|Fresh
Sadly, though, the finale isn't the spectacle the series really deserves, and I feel fans will gloss over the film's dull points and poor direction in favour of facing the reality that 'the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is an average affair.|Rotten
Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 lives up to the standard set by its predecessors, remaining true to their spirit while also delivering an epic battle royal between Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).|Fresh
As to the three principals, they've grown up with the Potter saga and have done so reasonably gracefully.|Fresh
When the time comes to face Harry's fate, Radcliffe confidently, casually shows how much he's matured as an actor.|Fresh
I must confess to being completely unmoved by the Harry Potter phenomenon. The books strike me as derivative and bland, and the film versions are, if anything, even worse.|Rotten
When Yates gets it right, Deathly Hallows: Part Two roars with majestic otherworldly oomph.|Fresh
I for one am glad to see Harry Potter come to a close. It was one of the most reliable film franchises ever to go beyond a trilogy, even at its spottiest, and I imagine that an entire generation will look back on it with fond memories.|Fresh
Yates strikes a beautiful harmony to make the most of the storytelling and the technology.|Fresh
Thankfully, Yates gives us one wonderful final voyage with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, a smashing, melancholy, and thoroughly satisfying conclusion to the eight-film saga.|Fresh
The seven films to date have earned almost a billion dollars each, so it's obvious their followers are legion. But this is also a series that takes itself seriously, never more so than in this, the deathly finale.|Fresh
Radcliffe's interpretation of Harry has been exemplary, truly amazing when you think about it.|Fresh
This enthralling film ends the series on a high note, exceeding expectations and delivering a fine conclusion to the films.|Fresh
It's a fight to the death, as good and evil whip out their wands and cross swords amid the ruins of what used to be the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.|Fresh
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a bittersweet parting for the Boy Who Lived, an excellent finale for the popular boy wizard who has captured the hearts of so many people.|Fresh
Passable, well-acted, but not one of the best films of the series.|Fresh
The movie ... manages to be a worthy ending to what has become one of the greatest film franchises ever released.|Fresh
Part 2 ends up being a worthy note for this decade-long franchise to go out on with a satisfying conclusion to bid farewell to these enduring characters.|Fresh
What truly unifies this ten-year, eight-film saga is the sense of kinship with its lead trio of young wizards.|Fresh
Ending the light fantastic|Fresh
A wonderfully rich adaptation of the final book's last act, but the central focus on the three leads might leave some fans disappointed, especially those seeking a more thorough adaptation.|Fresh
For the most part, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II picks up right where Part I, the franchise's shining beacon on a hill, leaves off.|Fresh
It all ends. And to be sure, it's a fitting end for the storied franchise.|Fresh
For the most part, the final movie delivers the combination of emotional intensity and rousing battle sequences befitting the end of a phenomenon that evolved from an unexpectedly popular children's book series to an era unto itself.|Fresh
"From any perspective-technical, emotional, storytelling-""Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is a smashing success."|Fresh
While swept up in the desperate search for Horcruxes, Yates allows us to feel once more as though we are very much in the middle of things, but, alas, it was a trick and a false hope, because in the end...it was, irrevocably, THE END.|Fresh
This is exactly what you would expect - a perfect and exciting ending for those who have been following the franchise. Those who couldn't care less probably stopped reading ages ago.|Fresh
Key moments are rushed or brushed aside, in favour of keeping the focus squarely on Harry and his two besties.|Fresh
|Fresh
Joy, grief, shock; the emotions pour thick and fast for the whole event and leave you an exhausted whimpering wreck.|Fresh
Whether we needed to have the book divided into two parts is open to question, but we have what we have, and it's pretty darn good. (Blu-ray Combo edition)|Fresh
It makes a fitting conclusion to a series that most of the film-going public has been following for over a decade.|Fresh
A fitting capstone on a fabled film franchise for the ages!|Fresh
Even contrarians for whom the incredibly popular series has been an uneven road will admit that in this final stop, a team of talented filmmakers have saved their best for last.|Fresh
An emotional, have-a-hanky-handy experience for many viewers as characters they've come to know, love and care about make their collective exit.|Fresh
Deathly Hallows Part 2's most evocative moments generally have him thinking about death, not just his own, but also others'.|Rotten
Back in the first movie, Mr. Ollivander told a young Harry that we should expect great things from him. With the cinematic conclusion ten years later, he's been proven right.|Fresh
Director David Yates, who has helmed the final quartet of movies, assuredly oversees the cycle to its finish.|Fresh
"The Protacted Ending Pt 2. Though it's hard not to be grateful that ""It all Ends"" this one is a modest success."|Fresh
The successful run of a franchise such as this is truly a rare feat in Hollywood. Take a bow, folks.|Fresh
"...as the ads suggest, it really does all end here for both the genuine and stimulatingly fictitious kids who have grown up dealing with the fulfilling assortment of thrills... horrors, action and laughs so easily generated in the ""Potter"" movies,"|Fresh
a very substantial fantasy film, perhaps even beyond the level of one of the LORD OF THE RINGS films. With one major omission the series comes to a satisfying and frequently spectacular conclusion.|Fresh
Radcliffe (and Yates) shine in the final hour.|Fresh
A fitting farewell for all the zillions of Harry Potter fans; not the best HP movie but one of the best.|Fresh
... Yates and company deserve credit for delivering the goods -- generally.|Fresh
One of the great things about this second Deathly Hallows is that it plays exceedingly well as either a stand-alone epic or a continuation of the previous chapter.|Fresh
There's visual overstatement, stone-heavy exposition, self-seriousness (masquerading as maturity), CGI-laden plot (falling short of spectacle), and predictable action sequences.|Rotten
Thank god it is finally over.|Fresh
delivers precisely what most viewers will be looking for: battles, suspense, revelations, and, most importantly, a fitting, emotionally satisfying conclusion that is entirely in keeping with Rowling's novel.|Fresh
The series now has the power to deserve comparison to The Lord of the Rings.|Fresh
Ralph Fiennes is AWESOME in this movie.|Fresh
If these movies have done nothing else, they have shown great skill in playing directly to a target audience, never swaying from that mission, and doing it exceptionally well.|Fresh
Possibly the weakest entry in the series.|Fresh
... a brilliant finish to the series, an action-packed finale with elements of darkness and beautifully integrated moments of humor and heroism.|Fresh
Como cierre de la franquicia seguramente no decepcione a casi nadie. No hace falta ser un gran fanático para esperar esta culminación con ansiedad, e incluso para emocionarse.|Fresh
This is a massive, tentpole, franchise movie with impeccable good taste -- its most essential, surprising and exhilarating ingredient.|Fresh
I think what works best about this final film is how surprisingly moving parts of it are.|Fresh
The Harry Potter movies aren't really movies. They're the world's most expensive book illustrations.|Fresh
"These films are Campbell's ""Hero's Journey""... Star Wars to a generation of kids afraid of being thrust so quickly into adulthood-a reality all too close to home for the post-9/11 generation."|Fresh
The messianic aspect of Harry's purpose-driven life comes to the fore... making this an action-packed, adventure-laden rewrite of the Easter story...|Fresh
This Harry has something the others don't -- the power of goodbye. That helps this film be the best of the series.|Fresh
This HP 7.2 makes a great case for lifting the entire third act out of a picture and just making that your sequel.|Fresh
it's successful at giving its audience the feeling that they have shared an experience with these characters for almost ten years, and that their farewell is bittersweet.|Fresh
The magic isn't over. Far from it.|Fresh
For a grand finale to a truly epic, good-natured franchise, this is a perfect goodbye that's very hard to beat.|Fresh
'The wand chooses the wizard,' says John Hurt, whose own wand hasn't made any choices since its scaffolding collapsed after Bea Arthur died.|Fresh
A wholly-satisfying finale to what is unquestionably the greatest coming-of-age saga ever committed to film.|Fresh
Lopsided and rushed.|Rotten
Unlike nearly every adaptation Hollywood produces, the Harry Potter films, taken individually or as a whole, are worthy-epically worthy-of their literary source material.|Fresh
It's the perfect conclusion to a wonderful, decade-long love affair with Harry Potter.|Fresh
This show, in all its surprisingly moving gravity and beauty, belongs to the three young actors at its centre who've held their own since it all began.|Fresh
The filmmakers thankfully remember that we've journeyed so far with these characters and so they trust that we, the audience, will understand the poignancy and meaning of the events that are unfolding.|Fresh
When the last train pulls out of the station and sends another generation of kids to school, you feel the fullness of a magical life well lived.|Fresh
We're a long way from the hijinks and humour of earlier episodes. Be prepared instead for a dark and thrilling ride.|Fresh
While 'Deathly Hallows: Part 2' brings closure to the sprawling saga, the primary reason to see the film is because it's entertaining.|Fresh
With nothing left to tell, the grand finale to the Harry Potter saga holds nothing back.|Fresh
There are moments of wit, fear, imagination and grace that one remembers over the years, but they are scattered among the long drawn-out, meandering narrative.|Rotten
The movie still looks drab, dark and blah but Yates has finally made a Harry Potter movie fans can be proud of and sends this Franchise off on a high note.|Fresh
One of the best of the eight films Deathly Hallows: Part 2 might indeed require a scorecard for the uninitiated, but for those in the know, it's a more than suitable ending for a decade-long journey that was truly magical.|Fresh
begins with a bang and doesn't stop.|Fresh
A satisfying roller coaster ride that Harry Potter fans have been waiting for since the beginning.|Fresh
Sharply directed and appropriately tear-jerking, imbued with the gravitas of such an epic finale.|Fresh
It's a bucket of maraschino cherries and whipped cream after no supper. It's a two-plus hour climax without an ounce of foreplay. A fireworks grand finale without a single sparkler cooling off in Uncle Joe's Pabst can.|Fresh
More than ever, Radcliffe is asked to take control of the screen as his boy wizard faces his own demons before finally facing Voldemort, and the talented thespian is up to the task, holding nothing back in an ofttimes ferocious performance.|Fresh
"""A worthy conclusion to the series, providing numerous worthwhile payoffs to J.K. Rowling's wizard saga."""|Fresh
A fitting finale and bittersweet good-bye to the boy wizard who is no longer a boy.|Fresh
This splendid final HP film uses special effects to full advantage, thereby increasing the thrill of watching Harry and his friends try to defeat the evil Lord Voldemort.|Fresh
If ever there was a critic-proof film, this is most certainly it - but, pleasingly, it's so good that it doesn't have to be.|Fresh
(Director David) Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves have lovingly transported (Rowling's) vision to the most satisfying finale, truly grand, in film history.|Fresh
Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is everything a Potter fanatic could want in a franchise capper.|Fresh
... a mostly satisfying coda, with nostalgic 360 return to Hogwarts ... Potter faithful will find a sizable lump in their throats as the music wells and intrepid threesome take their places in carefully staged tableaux.|Fresh
Merely translating the events of the novel would have been easy, but Deathly Hallows Part 2 - like all its predecessors - invests the story with a cinematic life all its own.|Fresh
The Potter universe, magical as it is, is more grounded in heart and soul than many fictions. You don't read Harry Potter to escape, you read Harry Potter to find your way.|Fresh
Not the be-all and end-all of its series, nor of summer blockbusters... Think of it instead as the lingering farewell to a fun ride.|Fresh
Thematically, like any good myth, the Harry Potter story comes full circle, with a heroic homecoming and the promise of more adventures, if only in our imaginations.|Fresh
"The ""kids"", Radcliffe, Grint and Watson, have all grown into terrific actors, which is vastly important given the material they must elucidate."|Fresh
It's a bit difficult even for me, a casual admirer, to reconcile that the series has come to an end.|Fresh
Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves seem to be on the same page in building intensity and flawless execution. This concluding swan song goes out with a bang rather than a whimper. There were no dull spots that dragged the story down like...|Fresh
One of the most faithful adaptations of any source material I have seen, in this series or outside of it... If only Hollywood would make more movies like this.|Fresh
[It] bungles key moments that have built-in dramatic weight from the book with ordinary staging and a breakneck pace. Many of the movies, including this one, have merely summarized the books rather than actually interpreting them.|Rotten
Nothing can compare to the experience of reading J.K. Rowling's books, which have been expertly condensed and interpreted by screenwriter Steve Kloves, but given the need for compromise I think they've done justice to the author's intentions (if not...|Fresh
In the end, it's the incredible inventiveness of Rowling's concept that makes it a can't-put-down book series with a not-to-be-missed movie series following closely behind.|Fresh
Harry Potter isn't about the wand choosing the wizard; it's about what education should be about: transforming imagination into reality.|Fresh
As we age, we all begin to understand that the world is filled with great sadness, fear and tragedy. Harry Potter understands that to confront those realities with a heart that is open to love and friendship is truly an adventure worth having.|Fresh
An equally thoughtful and thrilling installment, perhaps the franchise's best.|Fresh
Satisfying|Fresh
The series deserves a hearty round of applause|Fresh
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 caps the series with visual panache and emotional punch. It's a fitting finale to an unparalleled cinematic accomplishment.|Fresh
Ten years. Eight movies. Evil vanquished. It's done.|Fresh
As they say, all good things must come to an end. But in this instance, you can take solace in knowing the fat lady can belt out one heck of a final note. Thanks for the memories, Harry Potter. We'll miss you.|Fresh
Fantastic! Emotional! Its a full blown out war!|Fresh
Spectacularly epic, poignant end to a magical series.|Fresh
"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" ends the series on a triumphant note. It is a memorable and moving conclusion that will leave you wishing for more."|Fresh
The film expertly balances physical action and emotional development, loud moments and quiet ones, and it's that balance that makes it such a satisfying and proper finish.|Fresh
The greatest Potter film of them all.|Fresh
Harry Potter, yeah, it's not bad.|Fresh
The Potter films have gotten darker, both literally and figuratively, with each installment, and the predominant tones of Deathly Hallows Part 2 are grey and black.|Fresh
While it's all too easy to poke fun at the film's earnestness and clunky dramaturgy, one can't deny that it holds the audience in the palm of its hand throughout.|Fresh
In Deathly Hallows Part 2 Radcliffe shows us the man Harry's been forced to become. It's a real performance, layered and even moving.|Fresh
This incredibly satisfying and emotionally moving finale is frosted with sprinkles of just about every bit of Harry Potter lore you can think to name.|Fresh
Members of Generation Potter will be sent off with valedictory messages about friendship, love from fierce mothers and future mates, unlikely heroes and the importance of never assuming anyone is purely good or bad.|Fresh
A fitting final chapter.|Fresh
Not that part two of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is bad, you understand; it's much better than I expected, given the mediocrity of the series in general and the fizzle of part one in particular.|Fresh
It's a solid capper for this monumental series.|Fresh
Here at last, in the final chapter, the Harry Potter franchise rouses itself toward something approaching greatness … After eight installments, this last Harry Potter film finally left me wanting just a bit more.|Fresh
It's so detailed and mature that there's really nothing left for us to do but put down our round spectacles and our wands and return to our far less fascinating Muggle existence.|Fresh
There's no doubt about it: Harry Potter ends on a high.|Fresh
The finale is a great British triumph, twice as good as its predecessor, highly recommended. A happy ending, as I think it's known.|Fresh
My hunch is that your reaction to this haunting, magical final installment will mirror your reaction to the book.|Fresh
There's not much to say about this movie. If you've read the books, you'll go and see it and love it. If you've seen all the other films, you'll go and see it and love it.|Fresh
A towering achievement, a staggering, out-of-nowhere pop filmmaking triumph on par with The Dark Knight, The Return of the King and Spider-Man.|Fresh
An exciting, appropriately epic and emotionally satisfying finish.|Fresh
"...the greatest showdown between good and evil since Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader mixed it up in ""Return of the Jedi."""|Fresh
This is the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end.|Fresh
It's been a rocky road, but this final stop is among the series' best entries.|Fresh
End of an extensive journey, hauling a weight of finality that's bittersweet. Still, there's much to celebrate here, with the picture a stirring, magnificent conclusion to a marathon wizarding odyssey.|Fresh
It's a classic to stand the test of time.|Fresh
An unbelievably satisfying bookend that is not only Yates' finest entry yet, but one of the best films in the series.|Fresh
This Potter movie is the greatest, a fantastic end to a monumental series.|Fresh
By staying true to the book's themes, fans immersed in Rowling's world will be more than satisfied, and should be advised to bring a tissue.|Fresh
It's hard to imagine fans leaving the final Potter film with deep disappointment in this satisfying conclusion.|Fresh
So long, Harry. It's been magic.|Fresh
Will bring both chills to the skin and tears to the eyes.|Fresh
The film flies along, a pace underscored by the fact that it's the shortest of the series. Yates straps the audience onto a rampaging beast and offers an edgy, nervy ride.|Fresh
Fasten your seat belts. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2is an emotional roller-coaster ride.|Fresh
The grand finale of the Harry Potter saga brings narrative and emotional closure by finally delivering the grand confrontation all the previous films were building toward.|Fresh
The best possible end for the series that began a decade ago.|Fresh
You might fear that several of these characters won't be emerging alive at the end of the tale. Is it wrong to say you'd be right?|Fresh
This is pretty much a delight from start to finish that will thrill and touch audiences and leave them wanting more even as it concludes everything in an extremely satisfying and graceful manner.|Fresh
As strong an anchor as anyone could ask for, bringing this beloved saga to a rousing and irresistible conclusion.|Fresh
A fitting, shocking, exciting, mind blowing experience even the haters and contrarians will begrudgingly admit is pretty awesome.|Fresh
It is not often that we can chart a series over 10 years featuring the same child stars as they grow into adults. This phenomenon gives Deathly Hallows 2 a particular poignancy.|Fresh
Offers up exciting action set pieces and a rousing finale to the somewhat overlong series.|Fresh
Watched as a stand-alone film it's likely to strike newcomers as completely mystifying, but committed and even semi-committed fans will surely welcome it as a worthy climax to the most successful film franchise in history.|Fresh
[Ends] the series on an action-packed and character-driven note that works on most levels.|Fresh
I can merely pay illiterate, honest homage to the costumes, special effects and set designs, which are all fantastic. And to the actors, hamming and over-egging as if it is All Day Breakfast season on Mount Thespis.|Fresh
That both the beloved characters and the film series itself manage to emerge victorious from the fray after over 10 years is truly something to celebrate.|Fresh
after ten years, eight films, and close to 20 hours of engaging storytelling, Harry Potter's cinematic saga is finally complete -- and the last act is just as compelling, if not more so, than the first|Fresh
Just adequate.|Fresh
The showdown is full of drama, horror and even humor, with supernatural detours given a winking Kubrick-style spin by director David Yates.|Fresh
The final film has been labeled the 'epic conclusion' and I was elated to discover that it didn't disappoint.|Fresh
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is everything any Potter fan could want and more. It brings one of the most successful movie franchises to a thrilling conclusion.|Fresh
It works its own kind of magic, the kind that comes from a great story, well told.|Fresh
This is a terrific, smartly designed adolescent adventure, visually rich, narratively satisfying, and bound to resonate for years to come.|Fresh
Part 2 is never not good, but that's small comfort when anticipating greatness.|Fresh
We might not want to say good-bye to Harry Potter and his friends, but at least getting to see them off with a film of this caliber eases that feeling of loss just a bit.|Fresh
Deathly Hallows Part 2 sends Harry off into the pop culture pantheon on a thrilling high note. Well played. Well played indeed.|Fresh
Less committed filmgoers probably won't be quite as enthused -- Potter has long been a franchise constructed to please readers of the books first -- but should be sufficiently entertained nonetheless.|Fresh
Considering that it began with genial formula of spell-casting and flying broomsticks, the phantasmagorical imagery and violence in the eighth installment is fairly adult.|Fresh
There has never been and may never be again a story so electrifying over so many pages that has been so devotedly and expertly translated to the screen.|Fresh
The Citizen Kane of whiz-kid film franchises reaches an emotional and exhilarating end.|Fresh
The final installment of Harry Potter's journey into spiritual maturity as a selfless magician who is willing to sacrifice himself for others.|Fresh
It hardly matters that Deathly Hallows Part 2 is neither the best film of the series, nor the perfect conclusion to it. It's what it represents that's significant. And that's the end of an era.|Fresh
A dazzling, stirring capper to a once-in-a-generation movie franchise.|Fresh
"Like the previous seven movies, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" obliviates the line between art and craft, but the witchcraft conjured for this satisfying finale is uniquely generous."|Fresh
Harry Potter's epic journey ends with power and majesty. For 10 years, we've waded through oceans of exposition and endured ever-burgeoning layers of new characters and mythology to absorb. All building to: This.|Fresh
How do you compete with young Harry, young Ron, and young Hermione? You can't. They're ones of a kind. Good night sweet princes and princess.|Fresh
The technical wizardry on display is perfectly crafted and fires the imagination like never before.|Fresh
The eight-part saga comes to a close with an action-packed finale that neatly ties up the strands of the whole series and also manages to give its actors some meaty scenes to play with.|Fresh
Everything comes together; the Chamber of Secrets, the basilisk venom, Parseltongue, polyjuice potion, the castle ghosts... there's no fat here.|Fresh
So the wait was worth it. The eighth film of the seven-book series sees Harry Potter finally waving a wand in anger at his nemesis Lord Voldemort, and is not a disappointment.|Fresh
Ten years and eight films after the boy wand-twirler's cinematic adventures began, the saga resolves in ways suspenseful, romantic and thrilling.|Fresh
A well-rounded, entertaining and satisfying conclusion to this epic series. (Full Content Parental Review also available)|Fresh
A movie with no beginning and no middle but two-plus hours of thundering, momentous ending...|Fresh
Yates and Kloves find the grand scope in Rowling's book, and mine it for all the excitement and pathos it's worth.|Fresh
Exactly what it needs to be: artfully filmed, tautly paced, just sentimental enough.|Fresh
It's completely satisfying on the level of an FX-driven summer blockbuster. But most importantly it's satisfying on the level of a great drama.|Fresh
As a standalone film, it delivers intense and engaging action. Though, I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the final battle sequence we have waited ten years to see.|Fresh
A bad teacher visual buffet best consumed as dazzling hocus pocus. Mixing fantasy, Freud and freaky father figures with serpentine metaphors, unruly male role models, an Oedipal wand in search of a wizard, and stolen kisses during incidental fleeing.|Fresh
A truly magical finale.|Fresh
The best was saved for last.|Fresh
My, how the children have grown -- and the movies too.|Fresh
It has been extraordinarily fun, and now the decade-long saga has reached its grand finale. The best has been saved for the last.|Fresh
The Harry Potter films, like the boy wizard himself, have had their creative ups and downs, so it's especially satisfying that this final film, ungainly title and all, has been worth the wait.|Fresh
Now that the Harry Potter series is over, maybe the truth can be realized: This has been the dullest franchise in the history of movie franchises.|Rotten
The continuous flow of the two movies will hopefully be molded into a single 4-hour plus experience on Blu-ray (where Eduardo Serra's cinematography will really pop) and solidify its place as one of the best final chapters of any movie franchise ever.|Fresh
David Yates and his crew have hauled Harry Potter and friends out of the vale of depression where they languished during the previous film and pitched them into an exhilarating series of cliffhangers.|Fresh
With its heartening final note of hope and renewal, Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 provides an altogether fitting finale to a series that has prized the fans above all.|Fresh
Cinematographer Eduardo Serra underscores the sense of dread with a rich charcoal palette, and the outstanding CGI and 3D effects make the otherworldly threats more corporeal.|Fresh
Well done, Harry! You've saved the best for last.|Fresh
Tears are shed for the lost, cheers are raised for the (often unexpectedly) brave and noble, and, in the movie's final moments, there is a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment rarely achieved in filmmaking.|Fresh
It's always hard to predict how a work of art will age over time, but I have the feeling that, like its three young leads, the Harry Potter series will turn out just fine.|Fresh
It's virtually non-stop action, though director David Yates, who has taken good care of these final four, ever-meaner Potter adventures, does a very crafty thing, following adapter Steve Kloves' screenplay.|Fresh
"This movie is impressively staged, the dialogue is given proper weight and not hurried through, there are surprises which, in hindsight, seem fair enough, and ""Harry Potter"" now possesses an end that befits the most profitable series in movie history."|Fresh
I couldn't help feeling rather bereft as I left the cinema. But Harry is The Boy Who Lived, and he will live on in film for many years to come to delight new generations.|Fresh
A finale that's as moving, spectacular and engaging for both die-hards and casual fans alike.|Fresh
Director David Yates has finally found an ideal combination of exposition and emotion in his fourth consecutive Potter project. Writer Steve Kloves... neither wastes a word nor leaves out any essentials.|Fresh
Yates gives this final Harry Potter production the majesty it calls for|Fresh
This is a masterful and worthy final chapter in one of the best franchises ever put to film.|Fresh
J.K. Rowling's boy wizard gets a spectacular, yet not entirely satisfying finale.|Fresh
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 puts a triumphant capper on a decade of Pottermania.|Fresh
Worthy of capping off the series, but falls slightly short of being completely satisfying. With a decade's worth of material to do justice to, being fulfilling in the least is a praiseworthy accomplishment.|Fresh
[T]his is simply a great flick: powerfully emotional, profoundly resonant, scary and funny and intense and wholly enrapturing. It's a great time at the movies, entirely apart from its Harry-Potter-ness.|Fresh
