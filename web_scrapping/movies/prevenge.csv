"""Prevenge"" is a misanthropic black comedy that Alice Lowe wrote, directed, and starred in while she was 7 months pregnant ... like a total badass."|Fresh
The writing is authentic even when it is ridiculous, but what really shines through is Lowe's dark sense of humor.|Fresh
There's also some catharsis to be had in seeing a woman in power take charge and show some truly terrible men who the real boss is.|Fresh
Prevenge is a wonderfully original tale with the perfect balance of horror and humour.|Fresh
Alice Lowe's directorial debut Prevenge is funny and incredibly dark in a way that only British cinema seems to be able to achieve well.|Fresh
Alice Lowe creates a rare black comedy that makes the audience complicit with murder.|Fresh
Prevenge is a major step up for Lowe. She finds dark humour in the condescending advice dished out by a midwife, but behind the film's barrage of macabre assaults, there is a strangely moving portrait of a woman discombobulated by her condition.|Fresh
... its execution leaves a lot to be desired.|Rotten
Drawing influence from such revered masterpieces like Rosemary's Baby, Prevenge devilishly plays with the concept of unborn babies talking their motherly hosts into all sorts of nefarious acts|Fresh
If the script's conflation of delicate conditions is never quite as outrageous or unsettling as its creator intends, Prevenge is still filled with moments that show Lowe's skill as a director and as an actress.|Fresh

Ruth pushes through each absurd act with dead-eyed focus, though we come to find out that focus is shaped by grief, and that Prevenge has an emotional core.|Fresh
A very entertaining and eccentric product that, in its strange way, it's touched by a halo of melancholy unusual in the genre, courtesy of its protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An uncomfortable, twisted, brave and funny attention call to our idealization of gestation, as well as a brilliant tribute to the films of Kubrick or Polanski. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It still has the spirit of a Wright production, and that's a standard to which all violent comedies should aspire.|Fresh
Frequently quite funny, in an extremely dark way.|Fresh
Unconventional, savagely original, and unexpectedly moving, it takes us to dark places with just enough of a remove to keep us comfortable. Mostly.|Fresh
Lowe is a more striking and resourceful actor than director, and that's fine. She's clearly a huge talent, and it's encouraging to see her finding her voice so soon, even if it's creepy baby-doll drone.|Fresh
Prevenge proves that the actress-cum-filmmaker has a sense of cringe comedy that's distinctly her own, and it'll be grand watching a woman continue to bring her own brand of cruel genre toys to a table usually reserved by boys.|Fresh
Prevenge, like many horror films, is as divisive as it is thoughtful -- no matter where you stand on it. But I assure you, it is one not to be missed. Especially now.|Fresh
Prevenge is a sharp accomplishment that dares you to laugh at the truths underneath its horror.|Fresh
[Prevenge is] a thought-provoking, visually stunning film with just the right amount of humor to balance out some very gruesome and shocking death scenes.|Fresh
Prevenge forgoes the traditional pitch of horror-comedies and never mines its kills for laughs. The violence in the film is graphic but never showy, preferring to revel in the awkward muck of bloodletting, the reality of taking a life.|Fresh
Another storyteller might have designed Prevenge as a more comically-slanted effort, but Lowe has sculpted it to smash taboos and social norms.|Fresh
Exceptional film, bringing out the best in Lowe, who hopefully has more stories and nightmares to share as she embarks on what's aiming to be a triumphant directorial career.|Fresh
Lowe's take on pre- and postnatal depression and the dark side of motherhood is undeniably unique. If nothing else, you've got to respect a woman who will push herself through a doggy door while seven months pregnant for her art.|Fresh
What hoists this bloody battiness above much of the scrappily low-budget horror pack is the smartness of its execution and the strength of the movie's central performance.|Fresh
Perversely prodding at all that we take for granted about pregnancy, Lowe has found a pitch-black, occasionally profound story about a woman's loss of control over her body and mind, pulled between forces of life and death.|Fresh
Lowe's film is hilarious in its skewering of leering men and unsupportive women, but her film also comments on the trials of pregnancy and the often condescending attitude toward the mental competency of expectant mothers.|Fresh
Alice Lowe evinces a knack for locating society's most awkward pressure points, and a willingness to punch them.|Fresh
What distinguishes Prevenge from the pack is the unsettling tragedy of Ruth. She's either an unwilling agent of her unborn's malice, or flat-out insane with grief.|Fresh
A beautifully horrific, pitch-black comedy that perfectly nails the complexities of love, loss, and motherhood, Prevenge is a stunning debut from Lowe, and I hope we get more projects like this from her in the future.|Fresh
Lowe's film crazily reimagines the abortion debate as one that's out of both men and women's hands; rather, it's the prenatal tyke itself that's both in charge, and has a fondness for bloody butchery.|Fresh
Lowe has made a spectacular directorial debut in a film that is defiant, disturbing, and darkly hilarious.|Fresh
Prevenge turns out to be one of the best movies of its kind in quite some time.|Fresh
It's a fun film, undoubtedly, but what makes it also a necessary film is the visibility it gives to the challenges faced by women in the film industry who want to start a family.|Fresh
As a director, [Alice Lowe], she shows much flair and cunning. Prevenge throbs off the screen thanks to her talent for mischief and bemusement. She herds around a fine comedic cast and maintains vigour between scenes with Toydrum's pummelling soundtrack.|Fresh
Fresh feminist horror of a very welcome taboo-smashing kind. Nasty, hilarious, outraged and outrageous, and as poignant as it is blackly funny.|Fresh
Serving as an allegory on post- and antenatal depression, Prevenge is a kaleidoscope of violence and humour, a tense tale that wickedly extracts laughs through the banality of its suburban setting.|Fresh
Lowe, who reportedly breast-fed and changed nappies in the editing room, [has] proved herself a multitasking mother of invention. I can't wait to see what she creates next.|Fresh
Sadly, mother-to-be-on-killing-spree Prevenge doesn't live up to expectations.|Rotten
This is Lowe's showcase. She gives a predictably excellent central performance, and it's exciting to see a film that's this confident, bold and entertaining.|Fresh
Lowe's focused performance and her grasp of comic macabre elevate Prevenge to the status of rough-hewn gem|Fresh
Prevenge is a daringly bonkers horror-comedy by the writer-director Alice Lowe.|Fresh
Satisfying right up to its abruptly cut-off final moment, with filmmakers such as Lowe on the scene British horror is pregnant with possibility.|Fresh
Prevenge won't appeal to everyone, but Lowe deserves plenty of praise, given that she directed the film while playing the main character, not to mention the fact that she also wrote the script.|Fresh
Behind all the gore and lacerating humour there's a tenderness that speaks about grief, prepartum depression and societal expectations surrounding motherhood.|Fresh
The execution is a little amateurish, but it's watchable enough.|Fresh
Elements of body horror, slasher movie, possession drama and revenge thriller pay off in this entertaining satire.|Fresh
It is very morbid fare, but Lowe combines the Dario Argento-like bloodletting with a very British, very deadpan wit.|Fresh
A genuinely grotesque and original idea that never panders to genre expectation.|Fresh
Alice Lowe's directorial debut may falter in its grip, especially in story and tone, but it's a daringly evocative film that marks a filmmaker of imagination and promise.|Fresh
Gruesomely entertaining.|Fresh
Horror's maternity ward births a treat. The story's sketchy, but satire's alive and the ending's a scream.|Fresh
You don't need to have a warped sense of humour to enjoy writer-director Alice Lowe's gruesome black comedy, but it helps.|Fresh
Prevenged is a wickedly funny film, with a unique twist on old body-horror stories of 1970s and '80s cinema.|Fresh
A distinct blend of black humor, viciousness, body horror, and pathos.|Fresh
While perhaps serious in some of what it has to say about the pregnancy experience, as well as the state of the world we live in, Prevenge mostly sticks to dark laughs and does it well.|Fresh
Blends jet-black humour, edge-of-your-seat thrills and graphic gore with gleeful abandon.|Fresh
Considering that this is Lowe's directorial debut (it's her second feature as screenwriter after the superb and not dissimilar Sightseers), Prevenge is remarkably well-realised.|Fresh
Prevenge's underwhelming vibe is compounded and perpetuated by a repetitive structure that grows increasingly problematic...|Rotten
Perhaps best known previously for starring in and co-writing director Ben Wheatley's killer caravanning comedy Sightseers, Alice Lowe births her own blackly comic gem with this assured and accomplished feature debut.|Fresh
Something wicked this way comes in Alice Lowe's stunningly psychotic feature debut, a comical and savage revenge arc so fresh in its female perspective.|Fresh
Lowe has an awful lot of fun with the larger metaphor of Ruth no longer being in full control of her body. And as in Sightseers, much of the humour comes from the sight of gruesome violence playing out in mundane British surroundings.|Fresh
Prevenge is nasty without being funny, Lowe peculiarly flat-toned: still, perhaps it's good to have it so graphically demonstrated that not every mama's a madonna.|Fresh
Lowe might want to evolve away from violent dark comedy in future projects. But this one is gruesomely successful.|Fresh
At times, Prevenge feels like a woman's waking nightmare about pregnancy experienced as a loss of control over her own body - a Rosemary's Baby filtered though Lowe's edgy Brit-com sensibility.|Fresh
While not every tonal downshift here is entirely fluid, this remains a smart, risky one-off, unconcerned with those (and there will be many) who can't acquire its taste.|Fresh
