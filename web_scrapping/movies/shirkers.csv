The visual style of this eclectic documentary is intense and necessary. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A mysterious and frequently wonderful documentary.|Fresh
...offers insights into Singaporean culture, the visual imagination of a young filmmaker, and the questionable behavior one a very strange professor.|Fresh
It is rare that an artist allows themselves such a public interrogation of failure.|Fresh
Like an essayistic mystery story told in the form of a prodigiously cinematic 16mm inflected punk zine, Shirkers is nothing short of remarkable nonfiction cinema.|Fresh
The stuff about Cardona is obviously the draw [but seeing its] potential historical importance in hindsight is to weep for those never-made works it wasn't here to inspire.|Fresh
Ultimately less about the unfinished 1990s film and more about the man who kept it from fruition. Thankfully, that makes it no less welcome an addition to the canon.|Fresh
The unique, personal film is a truly remarkable one.|Fresh
A fascinating blend of autobiography, cinema history and mystery.|Fresh

A bittersweet gift.|Fresh
By making this documentary, piling it with her delightful idiosyncrasies, and reckoning with her dream-thief, [Tan] has finally toppled the structure that had kept her down. A new, confident, and triumphant artist has emerged.|Fresh
It's a consolation to know that Sandi Tan has been able, all these years later, to produce this incisive and compelling cinematic version of her story.|Fresh
Shirkers is one of those films that seems almost too good to be true.|Fresh
Shirkers is... a narrative that transcends grievances to situate personal experience in a larger social and cultural context.|Fresh
Gently-paced docu-mystery has some cursing, mature themes.|Fresh
Like Tan's original 1992 script, Shirkers is beautiful, complex, and haunting. It deserves to be seen.|Fresh
The final product is more akin to a s√©ance, a communion with a lost soul keen to still be heard from beyond the veil.|Fresh
On one level, Shirkers is a memoir - a fond, self-deprecating mulling-over of Tan's crazy, inspired, partly embarrassing but furiously creative youth.|Fresh
A one-of-a-kind story about filmmaking dreams deferred and eventually realized. (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
Shirkers is a wild and wonderful descent into the unfettered mind of a teenage girl.|Fresh
Shirkers is the kind of adventurous filmmaking that renders so many other bone-dry documentaries all the more tedious by comparison.|Fresh
Deeply personal, fabulously engrossing.|Fresh
"Tan's doc is wide awake to her lost movie's resonance, as film meta-history ellipsis, as personal coming-of-age saga, and as ""a time capsule of Singapore, both real and imagined""."|Fresh
Tan's joy in cinema is apparent in Shirkers' sometimes collage-like construction. Strips of home movies, found footage and clips from the movie that never was run across the screen, sometimes backwards and upside down.|Fresh
Out of the ashes of the original Shirkers rose the documentary Shirkers, every bit as exceptional as its forebear sought to be.|Fresh
Shirkers is part personal essay, part collage, part mystery, part mea culpa, and wholly entertaining. It's as energetic as a sometimes personally regretful trip down memory lane gets.|Fresh
Shirkers is a movie about dashed dreams and the meaningfulness of closure, but it's the opposite of bitter or rueful.|Fresh
Sandi Tan's Shirkers... is a study in memory and performance, as well as the complexities of women's friendship and creativity.|Fresh
A joyfully idiosyncratic memoir of a joyfully idiosyncratic-looking film and its maker.|Fresh
The displacement she puts on the audience mirrors her own displacement in the story. Yet the overall absurdity and weirdness will put its hook into the audience.|Fresh
With fascinating bravery, Tan goes backward in time in order to move toward a rectified future, confronting the memory of her complex, near-inappropriate relationship with Cardona, both an enabler and a betrayer.|Fresh
There is a sense of relief at the end of the documentary that feels like the first big breath of fresh air after stepping out of a therapist's office.|Fresh
What we - and Tan - come to find is that how the director describes or sees herself in the past doesn't always match up to her collaborators' opinions of the time; this is also a story about the stories we tell ourselves.|Fresh
A strange, warm and winding tale of movie love and knifing disappointment, nudged along by Tan's soft and pleasant narration.|Fresh
With Shirkers, Tan doesn't indulge in nostalgia, but rather evokes an un-calculated, offbeat sensibility that feels distant from our current algorithmic-driven culture.|Fresh
Sandi Tan's view of what the original Shirkers represented, and what her new film should be, proves surprisingly expansive.|Fresh
Thanks to the nifty, handcrafted-feeling montages that portray her youthful interests and tender narration, the film is enormously engaging well before a central story actually presents itself, but once one does, it becomes unshakeable.|Fresh
Shirkers is a film that should be experienced more than explained. That sounds like a cop out, but it's an inspiring documentary about the process of filmmaking, the love of outsider art, but also a cautionary tale about trust and shadiness...|Fresh
The first was, tragically, never completed. The second, happily for all of us, exists, and it's a gem, a treasure, the most delightful film about cinephelia since Ed Wood.|Fresh
The genre-defying Shirkers from Sandi Tan might be one of the wildest, most inventive films of this year's Sundance documentary line up.|Fresh
The texture of Shirkers is beautiful the way the traces of a black sharpie on the sleeve of a mixtape is beautiful. The audience is treated to visually arresting collages produced 25 years ago that are now given new life in animated sequences.|Fresh
Shirkers finds the emotional grounding and even universality in a very strange story.|Fresh
The viewer, more than the filmmaker herself, may lament where Tan's career might have gone. But she seems intent on moving forward - and this project may well be the vehicle for it.|Fresh
Tan presents her multifaceted life story-vibrant, unbelievable, and full of such incredible women-as a dazzling tapestry that's unlike many narrative or documentary films.|Fresh
It feels a bit like fate, as if Tan and her friend's work needed to buried only to be unearthed when the time was right, when a dash of nostalgia and the self-critical aptitude gained through adulthood can properly situate this strange work.|Fresh
An exemplary work of counter-lives and alternative histories, intimate self-portraiture and cultural reconstruction, hard-won empathy and painful reconciliation.|Fresh
But they were unusual people who liked unusual things in a place which put the idea of conforming above all else and made an unusual film. Helped by a gently choral score by Ishai Aidar, they finally get their due.|Fresh
But this is so much more than a film about a film, it's about young women breaking the rules set in a conservative country - the process of doing that was a lot more powerful than finishing the actual film.|Fresh
An alluring mystery spun from the joys and perils of collaboration,|Fresh
Shirkers has the handmade delicacy of a scrapbook come to life, blending ample footage from the original production with candid modern-day interviews and photography.|Fresh
