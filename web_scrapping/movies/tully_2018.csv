A great take on depression and crisis following pregnancy. Charlize Theron shines as she usually does. The ending is fantastic. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
The last act was a major letdown...but still worth seeing for the performances alone|Fresh
Jason Reitman is never as good as when he's collaborating with screenwriter Diablo Cody; bonus points if the film in question stars Charlize Theron, as Tully does.|Fresh
The arrival of dream nanny Tully produces some great insight on what society expects from mothers and women in general, but the story fails to develop into anything satisfying.|Fresh
Playing with the tricks of the mind, Tully feels more contrived than astute, having the skilled group of actors working hard to avoid further damage.|Rotten
An extremely well written and acted film.|Fresh
Tully is a return to form for both director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody. Featuring great performances, an unflinching and engrossing look on motherhood and a witty, acerbic script. Tully is a film worth looking out for.|Fresh
There's a decent story trapped somewhere inside that's just waiting to get out, but Tully sadly misses the mark.|Rotten
Theron's portrayal of Marlo and what her baby's arrival does to her is rivetingly brutal. Night nanny Tully understands the mechanics of motherhood but not its realities and is so irritating she gets in the way of a nuanced story of postnatal depression.|Fresh
Two-thirds of the movie is great and Theron is once again excellent - for a raw, yet offbeat, slice of dramatic comedy, Tully delivers the goods. Mostly.|Fresh

Two-thirds of the movie is great and Theron is once again excellent - for a raw, yet offbeat, slice of dramatic comedy, Tully delivers the goods. Mostly.|Fresh
It's awkward, perceptive, real, and smart. Cody and Reitman have a synergy that you just don't see from most moviemaking teams.|Fresh
In its humble 96 minutes, Tully manages more than most films that linger over two hour.|Fresh
Honestly, I expected the parenting tropes to be far worse ... There simply weren't enough bodily fluids to make this a truly authentic parental experience.|Fresh
"The film's third act ventures into darker territory, a welcomed surprise, which leads to an ending that left me unsatisfied. Reitman doesn't end ""Tully"" on an ambiguous note yet the resolution I sought never materialized."|Rotten
A timeless ode to the unappreciated day-to-day tasks of being a mother.|Fresh
What appears to begin as a darkly comical look at the challenges of parenthood eventually blossoms into a profoundly hopeful statement on the importance of self-love...|Fresh
A deeply important and incredibly relevant film which breaks the often verboten subject matter on what parental life is really like behind closed doors.|Fresh
What could've been a no frills examination of the trials of being a mother becomes a supreme test of one's patience as Diablo Cody dusts off a tired cliché and tries to refurbish it with some profundity.|Rotten
Tully tackles the subject of motherhood by taking a sincere approach, anchored by Charlize Theron's brutally honest portrayal.|Fresh
The flim-flam mode of filmmaking that has defined Reitman's recent trajectory remains steadfast.|Rotten
This comedy drama is blighted by navel gazing but saved by some gritty, insightful acting from Charlize Theron.|Fresh
I think part of the problem is Reitman. With his style, he's really stretching to make a point. What feels gritty at first turns to a movie of extremes.|Rotten
By avoiding clichés and crafting real personalities [Tully] becomes an enduring portrait, beautifully endearing in its blemishes.|Fresh
It's a story that will speak loudly, and volumes, to many women.|Fresh
Tully is one of the best comedies of the year, fluttering between dark family fair and a Mary Poppins self-help guide|Fresh
"The credit may say ""directed by Jason Reitman"" but you know this is Diablo Cody's movie."|Fresh
Playing opposite ends of a spectrum -- one despairing and worn down, one so hopeful and youthful -- [Davis and Theron] could both have become caricatures of those people and never do.|Fresh
Tully is a genuine portrayal of how overwhelming life can be and is elevated by Charlize Theron's outstanding performance.|Fresh
A bitter, bracing valentine not just to motherhood, but to womanhood, and an exploration of the fact that those are not always the same things.|Fresh
A film that any mother can relate to, Tully explores many issues of modern motherhood but also seeks to address the question of the individuality of self once you become a mother.|Fresh
Tully is slightly laboured, and after a long and intense one only gives birth to a conversation starter rather than a game changer.|Rotten
"...for long stretches, ""Tully"" is a drama-less drama."|Rotten
Some will see the plot pirouette that opens the third act as a brilliant narrative shift while others will feel it's a cheap dramatic device -- neither party will be entirely right or wrong.|Fresh
Tully is one of the best movies of the year, and here's hoping the Cody/Reitman/Theron triptych comes together far more frequently after this.|Fresh
Reitman does succeed at showcasing the sympathetic imagination and flesh impact of his two stars in authentic scenes of domestic mess and cleanup. And Cody attains new legitimacy and veracity as a writer.|Fresh
Can't resist even the most obvious cliches. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
A perceptive, bittersweet, warts-and-all portrayal that feels like a love letter to motherhood itself.|Fresh
[Tully] tells you you lot of profound things about the the character with her eyes and her gestures. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Obviously, something is not quite right with Tully, and something is also not quite right with Tully, either. There are too many head-scratching moments that will pull viewers out of the action.|Rotten
[Diablo] Cody doesn't rule out messing with the viewer if it means enhancing the meaning or making a film more visceral. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
In Tully... Cody and Reitman build a metaphor for the woman that every mother temporarily loses sight of when she becomes a mother. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It shouldn't come as a surprise that Cody wrote the script after having her own third child, or that this excellent ode to self-care ranks among her finest, most mature pieces of work.|Fresh
While Mary Poppins's magic is of the wholesome Disney variety... it's not that different, conceptually, from Tully's effect.|Fresh
The finest moments of Tully play like an insight to this female future of storytelling.|Fresh
[Tully] demonstrates how something can be so taboo that we go through great lengths to repress... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Clever yet sincere, a masterful Theron performance, and it balances it light and shade pretty well. Just don't see it if you're thinking about having kids.|Fresh
Pleasant, bittersweet and comforting... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is, perhaps, [Charlize Theron's] best performance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
After seeing this, you just might want to give a mom a hug.|Fresh
Tully is a funny, raw look at motherhood we too rarely see, and one that we'll likely remember for a long time.|Fresh
Tully endorses the very conditions it pretends to expose.|Rotten
Cody delights in placing zingers in Marlo's mouth without resorting to the full takedowns of her targets you know she wants to launch into.|Fresh
If who you were is who you still are is an existential question Tully raises with Charlize Theron as its center and forces you to wonder for yourself, too, whether you're a mother or not.|Fresh
'Tully' will tug at your heart.|Fresh
This is a worthy character study and it's hard not to feel sympathy towards Marlo and her plight.|Fresh
Charlize Theron delivers...Tully is exhilarating stuff.|Fresh
History doesn't always repeat itself... [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
[Charlize] Theron is at her best! She is beautifully engaging and delivers the character with her entire Being.|Fresh
[Writer Diablo] Cody locates lots of lovely comedy in the harried, hamstrung, and harassed.|Fresh
Tully is a reflection of what love can achieve. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Theron is once again a chameleon... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The script is written in a clumsy and primitive way, a pattern that gets worse as each scene goes on. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
While this isn't a particularly cheery movie for an alleged comedy, it's a finely tuned work that provokes without tipping itself over the edge.|Fresh
Tully goes in its own direction in such a way that you will either love it or hate it.|Fresh
Theron is wonderful, sympathetic even when she's being unreasonable, and her joined-at-the-hip chemistry with Davis makes the movie's unsurprising surprises work.|Fresh
"""Tully,"" a nuanced and funny yet painfully truthful film, tells the story of a woman, Marlo (Theron), who has a crisis of self-discovery around the birth of her third child."|Fresh
Tully comes with both bitingly sharp on-the-nose observations and a touch of fantasy, each handled with a mix of intensity and light heartedness - it moves and uplifts, and reminds us we're not alone.|Fresh
But the chemistry between the two actresses is so strong, and the story is so affecting, the unresolved elements of their relationship don't matter nearly as much as one might expect.|Fresh
A beautifully-observed slice of domestic life with a powerhouse of a central performance|Fresh
The scenes between Theron and Davis are so gorgeously written, they kick out new space in the studio apartment usually occupied by female character. And Theron is chewing it all, even using her physicality in a new, fascinatingly schlubby way.|Fresh
Tully has an extraordinary construction of characters that manage to transmit the melancholy of a mother's difficult journey that isn't neatly resolved by a nanny. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
While all of this will understandably keep many Christians away, it's fascinating how much Biblical wisdom is nonetheless contained within this profane, at times painfully authentic picture of depressed midlife.|Fresh
Theron's performance keeps Tully's warts and all portrayal of motherhood on course, even when the film's plot mechanics threaten to derail it.|Fresh
Director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody's fourth collaboration together feels like the perfect third part of an unofficial trilogy they began with Juno and Young Adult.|Fresh
Tully has enough lived-in performances and sure-footed observational truths to withstand the plot mechanics.|Fresh
This is all about Theron and Davis, who work beautifully well together and should see you past the supposed script problems.|Fresh
The reason Tully works is because of the sparkling chemistry between Theron and Mackenzie - it makes you want to spend time in their company, and that's largely due to two amazing, fearless but understated performances.|Fresh
Theron is predictably terrific, throwing herself into the central role with a commitment that has become her trademark. She reads the tragic darkness of Cody's script with a naturalism that smooths out its occasional, rather arch, edges.|Fresh
The real twist would have been if we had been able to watch and appreciate how Marlo had to actually earn her ever-after the old-fashioned way.|Rotten
Tully quickly becomes condescending and cruel - the script's mean-spirited jokes mocking 21st-century suburbanites are intensely off-putting.|Rotten
Courtesy of a willing, winning performance by Charlize Theron and the crack writing-directing combo of Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman (best known for their first collaboration, Juno), Tully is actually a funny, vibrant and enlivened screen experience.|Fresh
An extraordinary dramedy about an aspiring supermom who discovers the importance of self-care and the value of the sameness of everyday life.|Fresh
Cody and Reitman have really broken ground with their portrayal of motherhood here. It isn't soft-focused and sacred, but neither is it laugh-out-loud funny. In Tully, motherhood is messy and noisy and difficult as hell.|Fresh
Mary Poppins by way of bleary-eyed Middle America, substituting the idea that life gets better - or love means sacrifice - for a childish fantasy involving the healing powers of a 20-something, Greta Gerwig-type free spirit.|Rotten
Don't be misled: this is no comedy. Tully is a psychological drama about motherhood - without the gloss. It's raw, painful and confronting. But there is beauty in the pain as we partake in the journey and reach the destination.|Fresh
Charlize Theron takes the Fury Road offramp and heads to an even more apocalyptic setting in Tully: a nightmarish future dystopia for prospective parents.|Fresh
A grounded, sympathetic and often grimly comic portrayal of motherhood.|Fresh
The film balances big laughs with a melancholy air of dreams deferred.|Fresh
Tully is a real film that doesn't hold back or censor the truth of motherhood.|Fresh
The dialogue bubbles with black humour, harnessing all the rage in Theron - her best quality as an actress, as it was Joan Crawford's - to ferocious, hilarious effect.|Fresh
Tully... [is the director duo's] most grounded and visceral work yet.|Fresh
Mary Poppins it ain't.|Rotten
The cast is solid, the direction assured, but it is Theron, in the end, who does the lioness's share in making this funny, moving and memorable picture roar.|Fresh
An offbeat ode to motherhood.|Fresh
The perceptive performances of Theron and of Mackenzie Davis... are beautifully played.|Fresh
It's a slight story enlarged to universal dimensions by the sharpness of Cody's dialogue and the acuteness of her insights into the domestic pile-up that constitutes Marlo's day.|Fresh
Maybe with a revision or two, that twist might have worked. Sadly, though, it just doesn't.|Rotten
Make no mistake: Tully is not a witty, wacky comedy about how tough it is to be a mom (though that is its subject). It's a tender, dark, intermittently funny film about the choices people make and the prices they pay.|Fresh
Things stall on occasion, but a treat is always just minutes away. If there's any good in this world, dragged-along viewing companions will resort to rarely displayed gratitude.|Fresh
Tully is a continually engrossing examination of parenting in the modern era.|Fresh
An intriguing, effective, engaging drama.|Fresh
It goes where few films about parenthood go, acknowledging that you can love your kids and still feel that you're in over your head...|Fresh
[Charlize] Theron takes to this role the way she does most of her other ones, by throwing herself headlong into her character's space and inhabiting them as fully three-dimensional people.|Fresh
Bold and vital.|Fresh
Warning: Genre: Confirmed-batchelor horror. See only if you've decided beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're definitely having kids. Charlize Theron rocks regardless.|Fresh
For those who have had a rough go raising kids, Tully might require a trigger warning.|Fresh
It is strikingly refreshing to see women relating to one another nicely on screen, and Marlo and Tully's burgeoning relationship and candid banter present a surprisingly empathetic and extremely well-observed discussion of life...|Fresh
Tully is a rich, rewarding and raggedly honest delight.|Fresh
Reitman's best film in years and a reminder of everything that made him such a promising, celebrated filmmaker a decade ago (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
"""Tully"" raises more questions than it answers and that is a good thing and a bad thing. Good because it provides food for discussion; bad because it makes the film confusing and disappointing."|Rotten
"Like a baby taking a morning and afternoon nap - ""Tully"" turns out to be too good to be true."|Rotten
Theron, who gained weight to do the film, delivers all Cody's smart lines with the smartness they deserved.|Fresh
Tully is emotionally complex, bleakly funny and only slightly depressing.|Fresh
The dark script puts Marlo's frustrations on a very slow boil but it builds to a spectacular climax and the Oscar winner makes it almost impossible to look away.|Fresh
Theron delivers a raw, real portrait of motherhood -- naked not just physically but emotionally.|Fresh
Outstanding performance by Theron. After what seems like an interesting, entertaining, well above average dramedy, a reveal in the last moments causes one to wonder if something metaphysical has been going on here.|Fresh
Fearless Charlize Theron is a chameleon, but this is certainly not your typical Mother's Day movie.|Fresh
Profoundly moving and unforgettable.|Fresh
Reitman doesn't embellish. He allows Cody's screenplay and Theron's withered, fearlessly unfettered magnificence to do all of the heavy lifting.|Fresh
They don't make movies like this...intricate and authentic.|Fresh
... a sharply observed tribute to maternity that never settles for cheap sentimentality or melodramatic tear-jerking.|Fresh
The sad fact, however, is that, as Tully proceeds, it tumbles into clunkiness, and there's a desperate unsubtlety to the improvement in Marlo's lot.|Rotten
"Partnered with another powerhouse performance by Academy Award winner Charlize Theron, who worked once before on Reitman and Cody's ""Young Adult,"" the mojo and groove seem to be back in this touching tale that will garner both laughs and tears."|Fresh
It is difficult to describe, for who wants to see a film about postpartum depression? Of course, Tully is much more, so much more than that.|Fresh
Conceals a tender heart within an outer skin of sandpaper.|Fresh
It excels as a family drama, a dark comedy, a friendship story, and offers surprises in each of these categories. Here's hoping that we haven't seen the last of this trio.|Fresh
Inside Tully is a darker, more daring film trying to get out. There are startlingly original moments, but it's as if writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman chickened out in the end and plumped for whimsy and sentiment.|Rotten
Tully is a darkly funny and surprisingly provocative meditation on motherhood and the often untold pressures that it entails.|Fresh
A definite must-see. Loved the movie, the premise, the dialogue, the relationship of the two main characters. Love it all until it goes suicidal & implodes at the climax.|Fresh
Despite Theron's bold, aching performance, Marlo remains an avatar of some more general experience. The richness of her ambivalence and the humanity of her predicament are just apparent enough to frustrate the vast appetite for their fuller expression.|Rotten
[Tully goes] beyond the experiences of motherhood, and into the pain of losing your youth forever to the curse of irreversible adulthood.|Fresh
Female stars shine in dark comedy about motherhood.|Fresh
The act of tending an infant is handled with some of the grimmest humor this side of Eraserhead.|Fresh
"""Tully"" will not only give beleaguered moms someone to root for, but will also handily entertain anyone else who happens to watch. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"|Fresh
Featuring a powerhouse performance from star Charlize Theron, and some wonderful and legitimately surprising twists and turns.|Fresh
Diablo Cody's latest wades in empathetic depths before drowning in the shallow end of the pool.|Rotten
Tully is the work of older, wiser artists, anchored by a lead performance that's among the very finest of Charlize Theron's career. It's one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Filled with raw truths about the maternal condition, with a plot twist that suddenly rears up out of the story and transforms everything that came before it.|Fresh
An intriguing yet not-entirely-successful drama...|Fresh
Tully makes every hackneyed baby montage you've ever seen look even worse by comparison.|Fresh
"Reuniting director Jason Reitman with writer Diablo Cody, Tully is perhaps the crowning achievement of the ""motherhood sucks"" movement started a decade ago by French author Corinne Maier."|Fresh
"""Nanny McPhee"" with F-bombs."|Rotten
Equally raw, funny, and resonant.|Fresh
Charlize Theron's portrayal...is nothing short of brilliant, and certainly Oscar worthy. Adding Diablo Cody's screenplay and Jason Reitman's direction equals a trifecta supreme.|Fresh
Cody's writing has never been better.|Fresh
I don't think it's a stretch to propose a Charlize Theron Day. The actor has been so good, for so long, that she deserves at least 24 hours' worth of recognition.|Fresh
Theron and Davis are magic together, with Davis projecting a warmth that rounds out Theron's character's harsher edges. They're a dynamite team.|Fresh
A love letter to everything mothers sacrifice. And not in the stereotypical movie way of the harried cliche. It's not good or bad. It's just the reality of prioritizing children, no judgments.|Fresh
"A film about the extraordinary nature of ordinary lives, ""Tully"" is unfiltered and messy and altogether kind of beautiful."|Fresh
It's more than watchable, but also almost dispiritingly obvious and simplistic, by the end. Truths are stated, lessons learned, and platitudes spoken.|Fresh
Tully is emotional, unexpected and very good indeed.|Fresh
Though 'Tully' is billed as a comedy, there's nothing funny about the slings and arrows of the outrageous motherhood portrayed by a fine Charlize Theron. In fact, if and when you think about what really happens to her, it's not entirely cohesive, either.|Rotten
Great stuff.|Fresh
Cody was childless when she wrote Juno and she's now a mother of two. It shows.|Fresh
Suffice to say this is a take on the realities of motherhood that dares to go where few mainstream films have gone.|Fresh
Tully may speak loudly to women who can appreciate the overwhelming tsunami that has smashed on the beaches of Marlo's middle-aged life, a point at which the door has all but slammed shut on her youth.|Fresh
Tully may have its discomfiting aspects, but it's also a clever and entertaining engagement with common workaday weariness.|Fresh
This is a comedy with a hard, bitter twist of drama.|Fresh
A film that's full of surprises, the greatest being how it understands, absorbs and expresses the mind-dulling, soul-stirring ecstasy of parenting.|Fresh
Through magnificent writing, Diablo Cody brings characters brimming with emotion to the forefront of her films.Tullyis no different.|Fresh
All I can say is, may Theron and Cody continue to make witty and whipsmart films about complicated, flawed, and deeply relatable women going forward. Oh yeah, and that Reitman guy can come, too.|Fresh
What saves the movie from unbearable smugness is the lovely duet of Theron and Davis playing their deepening partnership without either posturing or a disclaiming wink at the audience.|Fresh
It's one of the more viscerally accurate portraits of parenthood, and specifically motherhood, that the movies have recently given us.|Fresh
[The] deceptively simple story takes on a range of unpredictable moods and shadings: wryly funny, claustrophobic, emotionally shattering. It's never quite clear where Tully is heading until, in a revelatory moment, it gets there.|Fresh
Even the most resourceful, imaginative filmmaker would be hard-pressed to redeem Diablo Cody's screenplay.|Rotten
Theron is a real pleasure to watch throughout the film, deftly alternating between her darkly comic jabs and intensely emotional sad moments while expertly conveying the exhaustion that mothers endure.|Fresh
Tully provides a climactic moment that's wholly misguided...|Rotten
"Sharply but lovingly observed with Cody's shrewd wit and enormous compassion for its characters, ""Tully"" is as welcome in theaters as its title character is at Marlo's door."|Fresh
Reitman reunites with Diablo Cody ... to give us something we didn't know we wanted: a mash-up of Mary Poppins and We Need to Talk About Kevin.|Fresh
An emotionally deep yet concise rumination on the nature of modern motherhood, on the inherently false premise of doing it all, of having it all and making it look good.|Fresh
Mr. Reitman has recaptured the delicate directorial touch he misplaced after Young Adult, while Ms. Cody's multi-edged sword of a script sends its characters down the damnedest surprising paths.|Fresh
Charlize Theron, Mackenzie Davis, director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody whip up the great existential-crisis Mother's Day movie. It's funny, touching and vital.|Fresh
A first-rate comedy-drama about the joys and challenges of motherhood that both provokes and entertains.|Fresh
Compared to sanitized Hollywood depictions of motherhood, this is messy and daring in all sorts of ways, and it's the nicest early Mother's Day present we could wish for.|Fresh
Though the ending is a little heavy-handed, Diablo Cody's smart, funny dialogue makes Tully an enjoyable watch even when it's uncomfortable, and Charlize Theron gives a strong performance as an exhausted, burnt-out mom.|Fresh
This is a film about mothers and motherhood, but through its stubborn empathy, even people who will never be parents have some idea of just how exhausting and unfair it can be.|Fresh
Tully is that rare movie that I wished were longer, in order to spend more time with two fascinating characters who could potentially have been part of one mother of a tale.|Fresh
Honestly, I'd have written this off completely if it weren't for the actors.|Rotten
While Tully is a comedy, it's dark, dark, dark! As you watch, you may find yourself thinking, Wait... should I be laughing at this?|Fresh
"Not many films address motherhood with as much irreverence and insight as ""Tully."""|Fresh
Charlize Theron is marvellous as Marlo...|Fresh
More often than not, Tully comes across as a group of relatable characters marooned in a story with nowhere to go.|Rotten
"Ms. Theron and Ms. Davis make a pleasurable, watchable pair - Ms. Davis is obviously happy to be the moon to Ms. Theron's sun - but ""Tully"" isn't really interested in the sustaining joys of female bonding."|Rotten
What holds the film together are a couple of really strong performances by Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis. They have a terrific, and unique, chemistry that helps smooth over a few rough patches.|Fresh
[Tully] features Cody's hyper-verbal brand of snark, cynicism and subtle poignancy, but it's tinged with the wistful perspective that comes from hard-earned maturity and experience.|Fresh
Yet that tiny slip cannot undercut a charming, touching, and deeply compassionate depiction of modern middle-class motherhood.|Fresh
Theron, who gained almost forty pounds for the role, conveys the utter exhaustion and physical toll of childbirth and child care with numb perseverance, love drowning in the chaos of breast milk stains and stationary Lego assaults.|Fresh
Theron and Davis are the heart and soul of Tully, a pair whose onscreen chemistry flickers with a magnificent glow.|Fresh
Captures the complete exhaustion of parenthood in funny and profound fashion.|Fresh
It's barbed, bighearted, and brave.|Fresh
"At its spiky, intermittent best, ""Tully"" is the best work Cody has done in the conventional feature format since ""Juno."""|Fresh
It tackles subject matter that seldom finds its way to the big screen and does it thoughtfully. It's not what I expected to see, but it's just maybe something I needed to see.|Fresh
Theron does minor miracles in the lead, her eyes registering Marlo's pride, insecurity, desperation, and rage, all under the smiling surface of the capable mom next to you at the supermarket.|Fresh
When Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody team up together, the two can do no wrong...a commanding performance from Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron.|Fresh
"""Tully"" plays a specific game of misdirection, but it's another remarkably observed picture from Reitman and especially Cody, who saves her spot as one of the most perceptive writers working today."|Fresh
Theron's a perfect avatar for Cody's irrepressible empathy for her subjects, wounded and loving in equal measure, and she's hardly been more watchable.|Fresh
They say you have to experience to fully know what it feels, Theron, in a performance of immense honesty makes you feel every ache, every strain, of her character's everyday struggles. This is the fiercest of feminism portrayed on-screen.|Fresh
Tully is still a strong depiction of parenthood that also makes for a startling and entertaining movie.|Fresh
You can see in Theron's overly caffeinated eyes and slumped back the layers of loneliness and self-loathing that finally burst through, demanding change. Their truth, if taken seriously, could reorganize millions of lives.|Fresh
A movie unlike any we've seen before, one deeply, intimately sympathetic to modern motherhood - to modern womanhood. Brilliantly wise and funny, and profoundly moving.|Fresh
It's surely one of the most authentic portrayals of young motherhood that we've had - and it's not like that's a much chronicled subject for Hollywood.|Fresh
Tully is a serendipitous treasure.|Fresh
It's a compelling performance worthy of an Oscar nomination, but I'm afraid the film won't have enough juice to get [Theron] there.|Rotten
Ultimately, there's too much sting in Tully to dismiss, and Theron's fierceness nails this down. The movie is so fervent, it's a kind of apology for the callowness of Juno.|Fresh
Tully is laugh out loud funny, but it's also extremely poignant with a meaningful bittersweet touch to it.|Fresh
There is a deeper dynamic going on between Marlo and Tully that is going to elicit mixed reactions, but also thought-provoking responses, and a bunch of stressed-out mothers are also going to come away from this film ready to hire some night nannies|Fresh
From these desperate beginnings, writer Diablo Cody and her regular director partner Jason Reitman have fashioned a film with a spiky charm and unexpected tenderness.|Fresh
Charlize Theron was destined to specialize in bruising comedy.|Fresh
Despite the rich setup, the plot is undercooked. It's a cute idea in need of development. The longer it hides Tully's identity the more apparent it is that it doesn't have a story or personal conflict to explore.|Rotten
I've seen the film twice now, and while I enjoyed it the first time, on second viewing I found it nearly profound.|Fresh
Cody seems to be taking aim at the feminist mindset that a woman who raises her children and is not in the workplace is somehow lacking in some social stature or hierarchy.|Fresh
While the story ends up too neat and tidy, Theron is a powerhouse.|Fresh
Much but not all of this movie's good work is undone by its silly and unconvincing ending.|Fresh
Diablo Cody's style of turning deeply felt pearls of wisdom into entertaining dialogue feels more natural and confident than ever.|Fresh
It's smart, funny and bursting with ideas about the joys and rigors motherhood and reckoning with the past and the future.|Fresh
Turns out Furiosa had it pretty easy compared to the rigors of modern parenting, but Theron's fierce performance and Cody's witty script will have you believing she can overcome anything.|Fresh
As usual, Cody's dialogue crackles, but never for the sake of mere amusement. Her insightful subtext stays with you after the laughs fade.|Fresh
Tully is at its best when it's simply moving intuitively from one negotiated respite to the next.|Fresh
Theron holds the movie in her hands and gives it to us like a gift; one we accept with joy.|Fresh
That it works as well as it does is thanks to a screenplay that largely drops Cody's signature sarcasm - so often used to mask painful underlying secrets - for a voice that is much more raw and direct.|Fresh
Tully encapsulates the psychological process of maturity with pithy humor and vertiginous insight.|Fresh
"It is brutally, hilariously honest about motherhood -- which will make it an important film for the many women who see it and think with relief, ""My god, it's not just me."""|Fresh
Messy, but then again, so is motherhood.|Fresh
Tully's strength lies in [Diablo] Cody's signature harmony between acerbic, wry humor, and stark, naked emotion.|Fresh
But [Jason] Reitman and especially [Diablo] Cody approach the material with the freshness of filmmakers still learning new things about themselves, still figuring out how to reconcile their grown-up selves with who they may have been in youth.|Fresh
...a major movie about motherhood in which Cody's signature sarcasm has deepened into anxiety, exhaustion and wisdom -- she's truly becoming a voice for the ages.|Fresh
Reitman handles the material with sensitivity and an unflinching eye for the detail of pregnancy, parenthood and female friendship that's by turns humorous and desperately moving.|Fresh
A delightful return to form for Jason Reitman. Diablo Cody's sterling script cracks along at a fine pace, eliciting strong performances and a memorable emotional afterglow.|Fresh
Theron is astonishingly good, giving a subtle, vanity-free performance full of deadpan comedy and emotional truth...|Fresh
Sharply observed but tenderly realised, Tully brings back the Reitman we knew and loved, represents Cody's finest work since Juno, and reminds us why Theron deserved that 2004 Oscar.|Fresh
In Marlo, Diablo Cody has created her most complicated character to date. Would that her writing displayed similar richness and empathy in painting the film's supporting characters.|Rotten
Tully is a remarkable film for its admirable effort at portraying a stripped down, raw version of the mother wish fulfillment genre.|Fresh
It's real and raw, bruising and bleak and honest to fault. All this makes it entirely wonderful as it's an unapologetic, unwavering, unvarnished look at motherhood.|Fresh
The Tully-Marlo relationship is born of solipsism and inner drama, and Cody turns out to be amazingly gifted at it.|Fresh
Tully takes some daring detours that I didn't see coming. And it's a better, less predictable movie for it.|Fresh
Despite a premise that welcomes comparisons to psychological thrillers of the past, Tully is an honest look at the tireless situation of one mother, that thanks to its sincerity and universal nature, speaks for the lives of so many others.|Fresh
With the help of Theron and Davis' magnetic chemistry, Cody and Reitman's synergy, and an intricate yet touching story about motherhood, Tully perfectly blends comedy and drama, creating a powerful, tender meditation on societal stigmas.|Fresh
It's the mix of the mundane and the mystical in Tully that will likely divide audiences. I won't say it all fits together narratively. But I think it works thematically.|Fresh
"The beauty of Tully is that Diablo Cody takes an experience we all go through and intensifies the drama and humor of the situation to the point where she slaps you in the face and says, ""this is you!"""|Fresh
Uneven, but Charlize Theron is undeniably excellent.|Fresh
Tully is both bitingly funny and observant-and a quietly radical statement on motherhood, sure to make mothers everywhere feel less alone.|Fresh
Theron looked happier driving across a post-apocalyptic desert with a car of frightened slave girls. The terrifying former high school beauty queen she played in Young Adult would glance at Marlo and sneer.|Fresh
Marlo is an incredibly complex character and Theron has no problem emerging herself into this role.|Fresh
[Charlize] Theron and [Mackenzie] Davis are dynamite together, the actresses playing off each other like two sides of the same coin.|Fresh
Diablo Cody knows her screenplay had to be innovative enough to make that familiar subject matter compelling. The result will feel slight to some and fresh to others, but, most importantly, it never overstays its welcome.|Fresh
Theron will put to rest any doubts about her feel for comedy; the darker the better.|Fresh
Packed with more than a couple of possible feminist readings as regards the parenting/career/life question, the often very funny picture entertains while affording its characters their share of no-laughing-matter concerns.|Fresh
"""Tully"" has its heart (and many other things) in the right place, but by the end you wish it had an imagination finely executed enough to match its empathy."|Rotten
