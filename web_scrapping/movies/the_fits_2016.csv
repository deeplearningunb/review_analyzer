"""The Fits"" isn't perfect, but it's a great example of what can be done on a small budget with a solid cast and crew. A must-watch for any aspiring filmmaker."|Fresh
So while The Fits never presses towards any ultimate explanation for what triggers its eponymous condition amongst the girls, by privileging .. a demographic whose experiences are so commonly excluded ... The Fits is fundamentally ideological.|Fresh
Unlike the appallingly manipulative Swiss Army Man, a trite and showy film about loneliness that treats its viewers like freshman philosophy students.|Fresh
The Fits is equal parts dramatic and surreal, and on a larger scale, proves that creativity in the film industry is not dead.|Fresh
No matter the urgency or importance of this tale, it tackles issues and themes that an audience member of any class, colour or creed will recognise, muse upon and consider.|Fresh
Superbly surreal, it marks the impressive debut of a handful of staggering new voices in cinema.|Fresh
Uses visual arts to indicate the interior sensation of one of the year's most fascinating and rewarding characters.|Fresh
If the fits are lemons, caused by metaphorical lead poisoning, then Toni's amazing closing sequence is lemonade.|Fresh

The Fits is a unique spin.|Fresh
The Fits introduces two startling talents: filmmaker Anna Rose Holmer, who has a preternaturally steady touch, and actress Royalty Hightower, who has a Sphinx-like gaze-until she smiles and her joy illuminates the screen.|Fresh
The Fits follows 11-year-old Toni, portrayed with nuance and grit by newcomer Royalty Hightower, on her journey from standoffish tomboy to member of an elite dance squad.|Fresh
Dreamy and enigmatic in the American-indie way.|Fresh
Like Alfred Hitchcock before her, Holmer realises that a threat is most frightening when it wafts in at random, when it can't be explained.|Fresh
Holmer finds beauty in the little details, from complex dance moves to a simple stare.|Fresh
A slight but intense little film.|Fresh
Holmer draws confident, luminous performances from the cast that rise to the occasion but never seem over-coached or phony.|Fresh
The Fits celebrates young black women, with an accent on their bodies.|Fresh
The storytelling is elegantly economical, characterised by a looseness and a spontaneity that's rooted in authenticity.|Fresh
The Fits is strange and amazing.|Fresh
Mood ultimately trumps character, but Holmer's helming brims with promise.|Fresh
It's impressive how much emotion and passion Holmer fits into the lean 72-minute runtime, and the fact that she ends it all on a gloriously imaginative high further marks her out as one to watch.|Fresh
The Fits positions Holmer at the vanguard of new voices, possessing the potential to enliven the frozen forms of mainstream cinema if given the opportunity.|Fresh
Its ambiguities make possible a fusion of dread and intrigue that reminds us of ways in which we've experienced adolescence, alienation, rites of passage, or self-discovery.|Fresh
Slow-paced and methodical, filled with arresting long shots.|Fresh
Hightower's masterful performance [is] as successful in detailing Toni's psychological state as Holmer's striking and poetic approach, and as expertly choreographed and yet naturally rhythmic, too.|Fresh
It's definitely challenging, and I want to give it a second viewing. So let's go ahead and call that really good.|Fresh
The dreamy, joyous The Fits is elegance and simplicity supreme.|Fresh
The Fits combines the energy of a dance film with the obliqueness and eerie atmosphere of an art film. I feel safe in saying I've never seen anything quite like it before.|Fresh
One could think of The Fits as an all-ages movie, but only in the sense that The 400 Blows is about children.|Fresh
A fitting psychological portrait of growing up in Cincinnati's West End.|Fresh
I love the way the film reminds me of adolescence itself; fun, silly times shaded with impending seriousness and tinged with darkness.|Fresh
Although The Fits is a short 72 minutes, it bristles with energy that explodes in intricate choreography. It is also gorgeously shot, with Hightower impressively carrying all the emotional weight of the film in her face and body.|Fresh
The film envelopes you in its spellbinding narrative.|Fresh
Anna Rose Holmer's strange but beautifully crafted film is worth seeking out.|Fresh
Holmer directs with supreme confidence, allowing the film to build to a boil at its own measured pace but not in a way that ever feels slow or drawn out.|Fresh
...a captivating, mesmerising, and remarkably painful journey into adolescence and independence.|Fresh
...captures approaching adolescence for what it really is: an out-of-body experience.|Fresh
[Holmer's] given us something almost otherworldly, using the phenomenon of mass hysteria as a stepping stone into adolescence. That her film uses little dialogue, instead expressing emotion through movement, makes it that more remarkable.|Fresh
I like a lot of things about The Fits, and the first thing that got me was the way it sounds.|Fresh
Coming out of Sundance, this fascinating low-budget drama features the kind of bold, skillful filmmaking that seems largely missing today; it offers a profound puzzle to ponder but no easy answers.|Fresh
In the best scenes, dancers take over urban areas, like a highway overpass, with their heavy breathing echoing across the cityscape as the camera pans out.|Fresh
The tale is overly aestheticized, with ponderously aggressive sound editing and self-consciously discordant music constantly reminding viewers just how Important Everything Is.|Rotten
First-time filmmaker Anna Rose Holmer has crafted a story so poetic and precise that it must be the pure, uncorrupted vision of its creator. It's not a flawless film, but it is perfect in its own way.|Fresh
Like its lead Royalty Hightower, whose performance is just as spectacular as her name, The Fits is impossible to look away from. It's gorgeous, poetic, and opaque, and I've never seen any other movie like it.|Fresh
The limited locations, lack of adult characters and the fact we never see the kids at home effectively creates a socially contained world with its own rules and consequences. Then there's Royalty Hightower's knockout lead performance.|Fresh
Hightower has a naturally commanding screen presence. Imagine if Steve McQueen was an eleven-year-old black girl and you're starting to get the idea.|Fresh
"""The Fits"" and its electrifying young star give getting in formation renewed meaning, with inspiring, self-assured verve."|Fresh
You honestly don't know what to expect, and when the film is done, you're not exactly sure what has happened.|Fresh
Virtually impossible to synopsize and not even easy to describe. Let me just say that this a rather special movie.|Fresh
A quietly audacious coming-of-age tale lodged inside a psychological horror film.|Fresh
Holmer's principle lyrical tool is her young star, whose luminous, almond-shaped eyes veritably burn with an intense clarity of purpose.|Fresh
The trials of adolescence come to life in fresh and mesmerizing ways in The Fits, a low-budget, mood-rich tale about a tomboy, an all-girl dance team, the need to belong, and a baffling sickness.|Fresh
... the film has an air of realism that helps tether its viewers to these characters as the storyline aims to sweep them off their feet.|Fresh
Anna Rose Holmer's The Fits is the best portrait of female teenage alienation since Eliza Hittman's It Felt Like Love.|Fresh
Though the narrative is threadbare, the concept of the story - girls at the rec center are inexplicably suffering from strange seizures - keeps us engaged.|Fresh
Watching the girls defy gravity as they whirl into scary, seductive, hallucinatory patterns, you realize The Fits is more than a transporting film experience. It's cinema poetry in motion.|Fresh
A sophisticated exploration of sound, image, and rhythm, where movement and music are combined to make the film dance.|Fresh
If nothing else, it introduces Anna Rose Holmer to the world as another bright young female director with a unique perspective and, especially for a debut feature, a surprisingly impressive command of pacing and tone.|Fresh
In Toni, a girl who comes of age, who comes into herself, the movie offers a brilliant, new, and sensory experience.|Fresh
"""The Fits"" pulls you in and won't let go."|Fresh
When I first stumbled out of 'The Fits,' I wasn't entirely sure what to make of it; after a second viewing, I'm still not certain. But I know this much: I've never seen anything quite like it.|Fresh
In terms of capturing that adolescent ennui, it's as good as any movie I've seen.|Fresh
The Fits is a movie that, if examined scene by scene and frame by frame, confirms its own uniqueness the way a conservationist might identify a member of an endangered species.|Fresh
A mellow meditation on a beautiful, little black girl beginning to bloom!|Fresh
A beautiful, hauntingly precarious coming of age film that uses mystery and an at times dream-like atmosphere to create a mesmerizing tale.|Fresh
An exquisite metaphor of adolescent rites of passage, with dance as the language of expression for an otherwise reserved character who speaks little.|Fresh
A highly composed technical tour de force.|Fresh
Just like its heroine, The Fits never gets swallowed up by the darkness that surrounds it.|Fresh
A confident blend of performance, kineticism, and tone, it has a pulse all its own, born of passion and curiosity, and a healthy dose of psychological mystery to boot.|Fresh
What Holmer does offer is a story about suggestion and nuance, about movement and emotion. It's a narrative film, but it feels like a dance piece itself, and it's strongest in its meaningful silences.|Fresh
Even in an abbreviated running time, The Fits manages to reinvent the sports story as something both brainy and physically pure.|Fresh
"""The Fits"" is the kind of film that asks more questions than it answers. The questions have echoing resonance."|Fresh
This movie casts a spell.|Fresh
A singular first feature from the young director Anna Rose Holmer, who's made a movie that can feel like a memory.|Fresh
The Fits is a rare little film. Not only are answers few and far between, but even the questions are hard to pin down. It's quiet and strange and simple.|Fresh
All ups with no downs, it's a motion picture in the truest sense of the term. I've never seen anything quite like it and I loved every one of its 72 minutes.|Fresh
Royalty Hightower is a powerful new presence in a film that nevertheless falls short of the mark.|Rotten
The Fits riffs on the power and mystery of adolescent beauty, and on the joy of what it means to move.|Fresh
Part of what's so terrific about The Fits is that so much of it is open to interpretation, even though the film as a whole isn't that oblique.|Fresh
Neither cutesy nor needlessly bleak, the debut narrative film from writer-director Anna Rose Holmer possesses a refreshingly intimate, honest tone about adolescence. The modesty of this movie's design has its own sneaky power.|Fresh
A transfixing meditation on gender and self-discovery, distinguished by the dreamy beauty of its visual and movement-based storytelling.|Fresh
The physicality and fluidity of adolesence are brought to the fore by Anna Rose Holmer in her tightly directed debut feature.|Fresh
Holmer films the story as if it were a dance performance, one where differences in movement and posture say more than words ever could.|Fresh
The movie's natural sweetness vibrates with mysteries.|Fresh
An offbeat look at a pre-teen who wonders to what extent she should give up her individuality to fit in. The title could have a double meaning: epileptic-type spasms, or fitting in.|Fresh
There's much to ponder in its metaphysical poetry, thoughtful camera work and editing and, above all else, its persistent fly-on-the-wall curiosity, the camera a soulful twin to Toni's ever-searching eyes.|Fresh
The Fits benefits from scrapping a three-act structure and avoiding crescendos and easy moralism.|Fresh
Even at its conclusion, Holmer's film refuses to provide easy answers regarding its meaning, instead using poised formal techniques to impart that which is not spoken.|Fresh
This singular mix of character study and mysterious mood piece might not have come off quite so successfully if not for Royalty Hightower's internal performance.|Fresh
An exploration of movement, motion, liminality, childhood and racial politics, The Fits is a fascinating psychological study.|Fresh
The complex mix of fight choreography and dance choreography provides a wonderfully unique framework for the narrative.|Fresh
"""The Fits"" is unlike any dance film you'll ever see, which doesn't automatically make it good, just different. The film suffers from being diminutively compelling throughout, regardless of how deeply under your skin the score gets."|Fresh
