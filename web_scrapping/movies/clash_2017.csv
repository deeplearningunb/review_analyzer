It's not a pleasant ride-you'll be relieved when you can escape this patrol wagon from hell. But Diab has created a thought-provoking and timely hell all the same.|Fresh
While there's not much room for character development amid the chaos, the unsettling film is provocative without resorting to heavy-handed contrivances.|Fresh
Intense, but tedious and ultimately fails to get inside the head of any of its characters.|Rotten

Mohamed Diab's superb Egyptian drama is set in the aftermath of the overthrow of President Morsi in 2013, with the army engaged in running battles on the streets with the pro-Morsi Muslim Brotherhood.|Fresh
"[A] fascinating, if formulaic insight into the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi's ""Muslim Brotherhood"" government in July 2013."|Fresh
A work of fiendish formal brilliance.|Fresh
Combines claustrophobic intimacy with some logistically epic scene-setting.|Fresh
A compact thriller with real human consequences.|Fresh
Mohamed Diab's tour de force is shot entirely within a police van as cops chuck some 20 people -- journalists, rioters from both sides and mere bystanders -- into the claustrophobic space. The sense of angry desperation overwhelms.|Fresh
A minor masterpiece of claustrophobia and expertly managed tension.|Fresh
Given the entire film takes place in this truck, it makes for immensely claustrophobic cinema, an immersive experience as we too feel like a prisoner, and it's unbearable to sit through at times.|Fresh
A jolting drama about the Egyptian Revolution, which sought and failed to bring fair and sensible government to the strife-torn nation.|Fresh
Manages to convey - with ferocious clamour and fearful failing - the physical reality of power changing hands.|Fresh
A riveting viewing experience.|Fresh
It's impossible not to be immersed in the characters' harrowing ordeal, and to feel every bump, jump, fight and fear-filled moment.|Fresh
Boasting superb camerawork from d.p. Ahmed Gabr and stellar crowd direction, Clash might strike some as crossing too often into hysteria, yet this is bravura filmmaking with a kick-in-the-gut message about chaos and cruelty (with some humanity).|Fresh
The result conveys a pacifist message with an exacting punch.|Fresh
Topical, watchable and only occasionally over-melodramatic, Clash should travel wherever there are audiences interested in getting beneath the skin of a complex Islamic nation.|Fresh
Clash builds to a climax worthy of its name.|Fresh
Clash has no theories about how war begins or ends, but offers a unique sensation of its cruelty. The sound of rattling metal will stick in your brain long after the credits roll.|Fresh
A horror film where the beast is the chaos, hopelessness, and mistrust that's been harvested in the wake of the 2013 coup; think Cloverfield if the monster is us.|Fresh
A claustrophobic, blood boiling, experience that is, surprisingly, very easy to follow and be engaged with|Fresh
Diab condemns us to the greatest anguish, locks us in a cabin with no oxygen or indulgences of any kind, and keeps us in our limit of tolerance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A vibrant exercize and a good enoguh portrait of a sociey that showed the world how to consolidate democracy, yet found itself back under the same opressive regime. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A challenging movie that works really well. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Diab shoots in a claustrophobic space with intensity an tries to build a shocking image of an uprising world. [Full review n Spanish]|Fresh
Refreshingly, and vitally, the film doesn't choose a side. Instead it shows us a group of people forced into factions by circumstance or lineage, unwilling to back down.|Fresh
