Mungiu knows Romania is in sore need of critiquing. The weird thing is, Graduation provides no excitement from such a critique.|Rotten
Cristian Mungiu is unquestionably a master dramatist and master commander of cinematic grammar, and Graduation is one of the most formally accomplished films of recent years.|Fresh
Graduation quickly becomes a commencement not for the student heading to college, but the father who's devoted his life to ensuring it happens.|Fresh
A case study of a broken society.|Fresh
For anyone willing to follow along it's a stunning look at generational clashes, trauma, and corruption all via the same restrained story.|Fresh
It may not have the raw sense of arrival of 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, but Graduation still retains that Palme d'Or-winning modern classic's thrilling pulse of morality itself racing to beat the clock.|Fresh
Even as it deals with big themes, the film is never pushy or melodramatic, letting events unfold to gently convey a powerfully challenging message.|Fresh
Brilliantly calibrated to wring maximum tension from the circumstances, Mungiu's tale is as revealing about parents and the pressure they put on children as it is about the state of the nation in which it is set.|Fresh
Demolishing proof of the toxicity of good intentions. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Mungiu delivers yet another profound, cinematic exploration of ordinary iniquity, brilliantly executed and well deserving of the Best Director Award received at Cannes in 2016.|Fresh

Mungiu delivers yet another profound, cinematic exploration of ordinary iniquity, brilliantly executed and well deserving of the Best Director Award received at Cannes in 2016.|Fresh
The movie pulls off an almost documentary, social-realist feel, but it includes hints of the menacing, the unknown.|Fresh
"The events it depicts are far from ""dramatic,"" but with intelligence and skill [director Cristian] Mungiu uncovers the complexity of the everyday."|Fresh
It's a quietly devastating portrait of good intentions unraveling in the face of systemic corruption.|Fresh
Graduation is assuredly a slow burn that revels in subtlety and true to life human interaction, but it builds to a fitting ending that both emotionally resonates and feels slightly predictable|Fresh
The only thing more preordained than the direction, narrative structure, rhythm, colour palette, and general sense of morality on display in Cristian Mungiu's latest film is that you are going to see it-because it is an Important Work of World Cinema...|Fresh
Like Euro-flavored Coen-brothers drama, Graduation is rich with character, culture, and corruption.|Fresh
Every scene reveals new wrinkles of character and, equally important, of the society in which these characters function.|Fresh
The entire cast creates a cohesive group, immersing us realistically in their lives.|Fresh
Graduation isn't as harrowing as Mungiu's 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days or Beyond the Hills, but it's just as unsettling, albeit in a more restrained register.|Fresh
For festival cinema lovers, a delicate film in performances and direction. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Graduation is replete with subtle and astounding revelations, hidden in a framework with a sophistication that can only be achieved by a writer and director of the highest caliber. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's in Mungiu's skillful structuring that his themes are given their complexity, through multiple threads that unravel at different rhythms.|Fresh
"The film is punctuated by exquisite baroque arias, in particular Handel's ""Ombra mai fu"" -- conveniently being listened to within the movie, in an apartment or the car. They assert a pathos that the film itself never quite produces."|Rotten
An absorbing drama that may have been performed in Mexico. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that shies away from unnecessary explanations and turns a traditionally joyful moment, like a graduation, into an oppressive and at the same time hopeful subject. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It may not be as intense as 4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days, but it pays to take a look at its approach to a man with a questionable morality that ends up corrupting himself. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A splendid and sombre dissection of the corrupt behavior of human being. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Without a musical soundtrack and through elongated fixed planes full of internal rhythm, the film is the perfect weapon against the apostles of moral superiority. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A fine network of hatreds, corruptions, blackmail, lies barely pronounced and stoned in the middle of the crystals serves to make both a painful portrait of Romania and, incidentally, a bleeding x-ray of the human condition. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

A cold and ruthless dissection of the current Romanian society. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What is good and what is wrong, and the chances of a new generation to overcome the pitfalls of their predecessor are the pillars on which Mungiu builds his story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film proposes a cinema as far removed from the pyrotechnics and franchises that flood the screens as from any idea of tedium, and it triumphs to problematize the doubts of the characters on what to do in each moment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Graduation, like all Mungiu's films, addresses the depths of the heart caught up in moral uncertainty and the choice to do wrong even when the protagonist teaches the opposite.|Fresh
By shining a spotlight on the everyday corruption and dirty dealing, Mungiu enables us to understand just why his homeland is struggling to escape from the weight of the dictatorship that ruined it and betrayed its people for so many years.|Fresh
Without provocation, the tension is gripping and Mungiu's gaze unstinting.|Fresh
There's nothing wrong with the storytelling here, it's the telling of the story in the first place that, in my view, needs some level of contextualization.|Fresh
Mungiu's genius is the way he lets tiny ethical slips build almost imperceptibly into something treacherous, even dangerous.|Fresh
Mungiu uses one man's attempts to work the system to investigate the workings of the system itself.|Fresh
Mungui's film compels because he doesn't just focus on bureaucratic corruption, his protagonist's undoing a series of pedestrian events.|Fresh
An extraordinarily deft, well-pitched and multi-faceted film.|Fresh
A striking drama that rigorously deals with themes of corruption and moral decline.|Fresh
[Graduation] is a masterfully composed effort that is instantly fascinating, moving towards its emotionally hushed conclusion with breathless, if still unhurried, intensity.|Fresh
Mungiu remains faithful to a style that combines realism and emotional depth allied with an impressive cinematic dexterity.|Fresh
The acclaimed Romanian director returns to Argentine cinemas with a stripped and impious film about the reality of his country. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Mastering a movie equivalent of a detached first-person point of view, Mungiu unearths hidden depths in the supporting characters while creating a three-dimensional portrait of Romeo as a man who no longer lives in quiet desperation.|Fresh
Graduation is a showcase for Titieni, playing a man who will risk all -- his career, his marriage, his reputation -- to get his daughter what he thinks she needs.|Fresh
A tale of corruption and decay that thrums with an undercurrent of discomforting familiarity.|Fresh
Mungiu's moralism is like that in Death of a Salesman: It rationalizes and sentimentalizes common corruption.|Rotten
Altogether, Graduation holds the hearts of its viewers, who will question how far they will go on behalf of their innocents at home, but it also makes it clear how Romeo's world, fair or not, exists largely of his making.|Fresh
A father's hope of redemption through his daughter unfolds in a mire of corruption in modern Romania.|Fresh
"""Graduation"" has a lot on its mind, but is told in such an intimate way it's like eavesdropping on a conversation: the closer you listen, the more you'll hear."|Fresh
There's a popular saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but from Romeo's point of view, his family is already in hell and he's just seeking a road out for his daughter.|Fresh
Mungiu doesn't provide answers, just examination, giving the feature a welcome observational atmosphere, encouraging personal interpretation.|Fresh
"Mungiu has said that his aim is to make movie audiences think, and he has reached his goal with ""Graduation"" ..."|Fresh
Graduation may not occupy a place at the top of the class of contemporary Eastern European cinema like some of Mungiu's other films, but it definitely sits above the curve.|Fresh
"This is a tough film that deals with serious issues, and that may hurt its box-office chances. But ""Graduation"" will probably be around long after less challenging fare is forgotten."|Fresh
The acting is outstanding; Mungiu's straightforward dialogue and naturalistic shooting make for a movie that feels genuine, with no false steps.|Fresh
"Graduation isn't the kind of film that jumps up and down and shouts ""Look at me!"" That's part of the reason I like it."|Fresh
A rich film that repays serious pondering.|Fresh
Graduation is an elegantly filmed drama about the ways in which a corrupt society can oppress the fragile equilibrium inside any family home.|Fresh
It's a slow-building film, more interested in occupying a place and time rather than spelling it out for an audience, but it's prickly and tense, and, in its way, quite powerful.|Fresh
Mungiu appears to be assembling a simple morality tale ... but with the addition of every new complication and the revelation of each old lie, Graduation reaches deeper.|Fresh
Mungiu eschews music almost entirely, his takes run long enough that viewers are forced to take in the frame's details and figure out which are important, and his flatly matter-of-fact conversations almost never include obvious exposition.|Fresh
It's consistently absorbing and well-acted, and Mungiu's camera makes even simple police station interrogations or drive-around sequences unassuming things of beauty.|Fresh
In Graduation, Mungiu takes a scalpel and dissects life in modern Romania.|Fresh
With shrewd filmmaking and emotional sensitivity, Mungiu creates meaning and symbolism in every shot without ever losing the poetry of the moment.|Fresh
The writer-director, Mr. Mungiu, is a master of ramification; his films start off as plain tales, told with seeming simplicity, then they deepen into complex psychology and spread out into contemporary culture.|Fresh
"Bleak, naturalistic and flawlessly acted, ""Graduation"" distills the mood and moral decay of a place whose gray skies and nondescript housing blocks feel like permanent reminders of its dark history."|Fresh
The power of the film is cumulative, as the filmmaker spins a mesmerizing morality tale from the dross of daily life. In his skillful hands, the ordinary turns out to be anything but.|Fresh
Mungiu is almost sadistically patient in letting this play out; by the last 40 or so minutes you can more or less see where it's all headed, even if it's through your fingers.|Fresh
"Mungui may burden his protagonist with myriad problems, but the film never folds under the weight. ""Graduation"" is compelling throughout because Titieni conveys Romeo's anxieties through body language and facial expression."|Fresh
Packed with authentic characters we can easily identify with, it's powerfully thought-provoking, dramatically gripping and bursting with meaning, even though it never preaches at us.|Fresh
Graduation is about relatively mundane occurrences, but as Romeo is pulled further and further from his moral certainty, the film becomes incredibly gripping and unsettling.|Fresh
To director Cristian Mungiu, Romania is not just a country - it's a state of mind. His latest is a gripping thriller that shows his social-realist concern for people who believe they can't raise their position based on merit alone.|Fresh
A thoroughgoing masterpiece which offers proof that Romania's cinematic upsurge remains the most vital and important national film movement of the current century.|Fresh
"""Graduation"" is long and intense, a rigorously naturalistic film that at times feels as claustrophobic and suspenseful as a horror movie."|Fresh
Graduation opens with a brick thrown through an apartment window, and unfolds with that same kind of propulsive force.|Fresh
What makes Graduation so marvelous is how the texture of the film springs from the situation. Each new complication to the script feels like a surgical insertion, mirroring Adrian's profession.|Fresh
Though Mungiu is very much his own man, there's more than a whiff of Michael Haneke in his basilisk-eyed view of humanity.|Fresh
There's a strong stylistic integrity to this study of integrity corrupted. What it lacks is the nerve-fraying immediacy of Mungiu's earlier work.|Fresh
Emotionally devastating and endlessly thought-provoking.|Fresh
"Romeo's actions display not only a ""fix it"" version of masculinity, but are also a personal manifestation of the country's malaise."|Fresh
Cristian Mungiu reflects on guilt and social responsibility in this Miller-like portrait of a man haunted by his own mendacity.|Fresh
Graduation isn't one of Mungiu's finest, but even a restrained, emotionally measured work like this is more interesting and provocative than many another director's best effort.|Fresh
In this wonderfully orchestrated film, Mungiu illustrates how the omnipresence of backhanders and corruption ruins all achievement and makes real advancement impossible.|Fresh
Cristian Mungiu returns with a seismic study of desperation, regret and morality that examines the more serious implications of local corruption. Titieni -- pretty much in every scene here -- is immense.|Fresh
There's a second-hand feel to his state-of-the-nation look at civic corruption, and to the plot's moments of ominous mystery, which recall Michael Haneke. That the film remains strong and involving is largely due to its core subject.|Fresh
Uncompromising in its vision of the cost of parental responsibility|Fresh
Behind every turn of the plot lies an overwhelming plea: How do you get the hell out of purgatory?|Fresh
Superbly acted, and photographed and edited with forensic precision, this is Romanian cinema at its best.|Fresh
"The director of the marvelous ""4 months, 3 weeks, and 2 days gets solid performances in a movie about wheeling and dealing in post-Ceausecui Romania."|Fresh
It's an overall satisfying drama from Mungiu, but signs of exhaustion in his ideas are starting to show. There's only so much bleakness any person can take from another.|Fresh
It's a deeply forlorn canvas, as if Mungiu, a generation after 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, confirms that his protagonists just can't escape the rites and habits of the world that formed them.|Fresh
[A] probing, nervy and ultimately satisfying film ...|Fresh
A humane morality play, set against the murky bureaucracy of post-communist Romania.|Fresh
It's a brilliantly done piece.|Fresh
Mungiu paints an unflattering portrait of a society gone to seed, but the film's moral is universal: no matter how high-minded or well intended, corruption is always corruption.|Fresh
Graduation is undoubtedly a bit of a slow-burner but it grows in intensity and becomes completely absorbing as we discover a whole world of guilty secrets and hidden lives.|Fresh
Mungiu gives almost every character, devilish or not, his due, plus his back-story and biographical DNA.|Fresh
Graduation is utterly compelling in spite of a seemingly downbeat story.|Fresh
Echoes of Michael Haneke's Hidden and Cristi Puiu's Aurora reverberate around this lament for those Romanians whose dreams have been betrayed by the nation's failure to slip the shackles of its sinister past.|Fresh
Masterfully filmed in long takes, this slow-burner lays bare a world of systemic corruption.|Fresh
Mungiu has a rare ability to glimpse into the soul of modern Romania and find the personal dilemmas that strike a universal chord.|Fresh
Fans of the Romanian New Wave are sure to find plenty to admire about this nuanced character drama.|Fresh
Cristian Mungiu's latest offers another suspenseful web of compromises, with an achingly sad figure at its centre.|Fresh
The acting is glumly flawless and the camera work as intimate as Michael Haneke's, but Graduation is two hours of waiting for a second shoe that never drops.|Rotten
A mature drama where the claim of young people to adults for the world they inherit, but also for taking responsibility for their own lives are present. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that exposes a metaphor of a country from the perspective of individuals with a personality and their own well-defined interactions. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A particularly high point for mid-2010's art cinema.|Fresh
There are no heroes are villains here, only people who are flawed and desperate. The acting, as in Mungiu's previous films, is extraordinary.|Fresh
Yet another example of how Mungiu masterfully weaves an intimate character drama into an intelligent commentary on injustices in Romanian society.|Fresh
Meticulously structured.|Fresh
Graduation shares with [4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days] a sense of how personal morality can be misshapen by the institutions of an immoral society.|Fresh
Cristian Mungiu's film is more than just a cry of despair toward the hopelessness of life in modern-day Romania.|Fresh
This isn't as hard-hitting as Mungiu's other Cannes contenders, but the subtleties of quiet backslapping and knowing-a-guy turn out to be plenty dramatic.|Fresh
"[CANNES 2016] ""Bacalaureat"" suffers from too many narrative threads that don't resolve. The film's climax feels pedestrian even if the filmmakers' intentions ring true."|Rotten
Back-scratching as a communal solution may not be that novel, or win Mungiu a second Palme, but the intergenerational debate underlying Graduation does throw novel wrinkles into the mix.|Fresh
A well-acted and efficiently directed but schematic rehash of themes that Mungiu and his fellow new-wavers have expounded time and again over the last decade.|Fresh
A beautifully crafted work of storytelling that resonates long after you see it.|Fresh
A brutally honest movie.|Fresh
An expertly calibrated portrait of what happens when someone starts down a slippery slope of well-intentioned malfeasance.|Fresh
Intimate, epic and crisply intelligent: Haneke with a human touch and no desire to judge.|Fresh
This portrait of parental dilemma which erupts out of the blue but is deeply anchored in Romanian soil is a universal story which brings with it strong prospects for both prestige and market success.|Fresh
A doctor greases the system in order to ensure his daughter aces her finals in Cristian Mungiu's beautifully structured yet familiar look at a dysfunctional society.|Fresh
Graduation is an intricate, deeply intelligent picture, and a bleak picture of a state of national depression in Romania, where the 90s generation hoped they would have a chance to start again.|Fresh
