Amid the grand themes about love of the land and kin are some wonderfully bizarre comic moments. One to savour.|Fresh
Rams is the kind of film whose evident craft belies its lack of adventurousness; its virtues are mostly predictable, its revelations far from revelatory as it plods inexorably from one situational hurdle to another.|Rotten
Plays out as a droll comedy that held my attention throughout.|Fresh
The film's gorgeous cinematography captures a world that couldn't feel more distant from a life of smartphone notifications and open office structures.|Fresh
Although Rams never feels like nature porn, Sturla Brandth Grvlen's lensing is always stunning.|Fresh
Offers a masterclass in minimalist film-making that lacks for nothing in colour and character.|Fresh
Rams isn't the film that is going to definitively put Iceland on the world cinema map, but it is the boldest invitation yet about the distinctive tone of their cinema.|Fresh
Hkonarson doesn't lessen the harshness of the characters or the landscape, but still manages to find beauty in the way they are.|Fresh
After grim comedy comes the threat of grim tragedy. The ending is a do-or-die confrontation with the elements, powerfully presented.|Fresh
It never becomes deep, but its tender view of its richly drawn characters makes it beguiling to the end.|Fresh

It's a delight to encounter a film that quietly, gradually creeps up on you; which, without seeming to expand a huge amount of effort in so doing, puts a smile on your face.|Fresh
Gummi and Kiddi's interactions tend toward the comical, but the rock-steady widescreen cinematography by Sturla Brandth Grvlen lends the proceedings a deadpan aura.|Fresh
Deadpan Scandi-humour runs through writer/director Grmur Hkonarson's carefully crafted tale, and there's no doubting the film's empathy for its protagonists. Shame, then, that the final-reel shift into tragedy feels misplaced.|Fresh
...takes place at the end of the world, but it's a place that means all the world to the two brothers at its center.|Fresh
Hakonarson taps into something almost mythical: the bearded brothers, who could have stepped off the set of an Old Testament epic, may hate each other, but they share a fierce pride in their flocks' pure and ancient bloodline.|Fresh
The quirkiness that seems omnipresent in much of the film falls away to reveal something hard and brutally meaningful.|Fresh
With so many wild scenarios tackled at once, perhaps it's Rams' meek emotional realism that ultimately holds it back from the tragicomic tour de force that it wants to be.|Rotten
he superb film's ending is so primordial you'll know it's about far more than livestock and sibling rivalry.|Fresh
Rams is a very strange film, but it's one that takes us to the top of the world to find people that, sure enough, we recognize as ourselves.|Fresh
This small, peculiar story becomes strangely involving; it's a movie that sneaks up on you, right up to the bursting-dam emotion of its extraordinary closing scenes.|Fresh
With a simple and everyday premise, Hkornason not only creates a touching study of a fractured family dynamic, but also makes a commentary about the necessity to unite as a society in the face of adversity. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hkonarson know exactly how to navigate between a customs comedy and an endearing family drama. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hkonarson explores fraternity with great warmth and illustrates how we can unite when adversity comes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Rams is an almost silent film, a slow burn if you will, that never sacrifices the thrills and comedy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film where sheep and rams have more dialogues that the main characters, yet somehow it's as fun and heart warming as a brothers embrace in the snow. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's little about this perceptive examination of the bonds of blood, the struggles of farming life, and the importance of finding hope and humour in even the bleakest of circumstances, that feels routine or overly familiar.|Fresh
The remote rural setting plays a key part in the success of Rams, as do the rustically endearing lead performances of Sigurjonsson, Juliusson and their ovine co-stars.|Fresh
Hkonarson delivers an honest story about two men and their relationship with nature. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is Rams' two-legged antagonists, to be sure, that are locking horns here. Theirs is a primal struggle, wisely left unspecified -- all the better to activate our imaginations.|Fresh
A pleasingly modest and sometimes incredibly moving film.|Fresh
This powerful volcanic landscape needs a complimentary style and Hakonarson brings one: long takes with little camera movement, almost a series of tableaux. It's similar to documentary but with a more poetic touch.|Fresh
The shafts of humour don't shine nearly as brightly as they should.|Rotten
Deceptively seductive in its veracity and subtlety, Rams engages us, intrigues us and finally moves us beyond our expectations|Fresh
It's a story about sheep, estranged brothers and following rules - or not. The story may be simple, but the sentiments are not - we are fascinated, horrified, amused and greatly moved|Fresh
This is a film that allows you space to think, to make connections -- and to wonder what is going on and why. The actors are often silent; they are like people we might meet at any time, and being with them is challenging and rewarding.|Fresh
Sigurjnsson's quiet, soulful performance illuminates the loneliness of a man living in a cold and remote valley, with no one but his worst enemy and dozens of sheep in the vicinity.|Fresh
"Steeped in a specific regional culture, you never know quite where ""Rams"" is headed."|Fresh
I felt that I was sharing my time with real people with a real story.|Fresh
Here is a most unusual comic drama from Iceland that plays some very clever games with tone.|Fresh
A confidently observed drama that bathes in behavior, adding bits of comedy and tragedy to help underline pleasing idiosyncrasy.|Fresh
Despite living within a stone's throw of each other, the two haven't spoken in 40 years. Granted, there's not much dialogue between anyone in this almost comically minimalist Scandinavian film.|Fresh
The film has less of the dark humor Icelandic films are known for, and an ending that elevates the material.|Fresh
An amiable, if frustratingly undemanding piece of cinema.|Fresh
it is through Gummi's eloquent silence, and even more eloquent expressions, that the emotional tension and the relief find their expression|Fresh
At its heart it's a tender story with a fuzzy exterior; a sheep in sheep's clothing, if you will.|Fresh
This Icelandic dramedy is droll and truthful.|Fresh
Alternately witty and moody.|Fresh
Writer/director Grmur Hkonarson starts his movie as an observational absurdist comedy but develops it into something far richer.|Fresh
The film's touching final scene is imbued with the raw truth of a prairie fable told among shepherds over the centuries.|Fresh
Deadpan comedy and a sense of compassion mark this as a film to seek out and treasure.|Fresh
Sigurur Sigurjnsson and Theodr Jlusson are utterly convincing as the battling brothers whose alienation is expressed more through morosely bearded gesture than drunken buckshot dialogue.|Fresh
Deceptively unassuming storytelling (understated acting and the rhythm of the long takes) gives way to a slow thaw, beguiling the viewer without overstaying its welcome (at a precise 93 minutes).|Fresh
A drama that offers a portrait of dedication and alienation, as well as of an unspoken, honored-entirely-in-the-breach bond between brothers who've spent a lifetime butting heads near the top of the world.|Fresh
Exists on the spectrum between 'fascinating and unclassifiably odd' and 'could almost be a parody of an arthouse film except it's too moving to be a joke.'|Fresh
Mesmerizing, breathtaking and quietly poignant with a delicate blend of drama and comic relief.|Fresh
A satisfying and quirky slice-of-life film set in rural Iceland.|Fresh
Slowly, inevitably, things turn tender, but the slide comes naturally, too, and things end on a note of unexpected seriousness that feels earned, even though next to nothing has been said.|Fresh
Though it's fairly obvious how the film is going to play out (and, sadly, it plays out exactly as expected), Rams spends far too long dawdling when it comes to the matter of settling on its tone.|Rotten
Credible, hilarious and poignant by turns, Rams is a keenly detailed, well-paced and entertaining tale of family dynamics ...|Fresh
Two estranged fraternal Icelandic sheep farmers might not seem like the most promising of movie subjects. Think again.|Fresh
"Serious and moving but also with a bleaker than bleak Scandinavian sense of humor, ""Rams"" is so much its own film that figuring out where its unusual, unpredictable plot will end up is difficult if not impossible."|Fresh
Hkonarson has an eye both for the forbidding beauty of the landscapes and for comic detail.|Fresh
To find another film whose straightforward, almost homespun simplicity masks a director in truly confident control of his material you'd probably have to go back to David Lynch's The Straight Story.|Fresh
Rams is a gorgeous, tender and unexpectedly moving film about the most unlikely of subjects: sheep farming in the northern valleys of Iceland.|Fresh
Rams fits in to a melancholy Nordic tradition -- think of Kitchen Stories, Of Horses and Men or the hangdog comedies of Aki Kaurismki -- where whimsy is forever being elbowed aside by despair.|Fresh
"For all its intrinsic Nordic absurdity, Chaplinesque pathos and unsettling use of vastness, writer-director Grmur Hkonarson's ""Rams"" is also a moving, deftly told tale about various kinds of loss."|Fresh
If the movie touches on universal issues of sibling rivalry, the psychological insight is almost incidental in what is an intensely particular and roughly tender tone piece.|Fresh
Highly recommended.|Fresh
Switching from dour humour to humanist drama without seeming contrived, this is a masterclass in combining character and landscape that is played with deceptive poignancy by the excellent leads.|Fresh
Sigurjnsson and Jlusson build on this in their distinct performances (one's angry, the other more sorrowful), silently conveying the weight of whatever long-ago betrayal led to their estrangement.|Fresh
[VIDEO ESSAY] an eloquent character and social study of tortured souls at the mercy of nature's volatile whims.|Fresh
'Rams' is quiet, measured and charming.|Fresh
Director Grmur Hkonarson excels at building tension through long takes, and the actors are excellent. Sigurjnsson offers a world of meaning in a grunt or a lift of the shoulders.|Fresh
You spend a rather long time during this movie simply watching characters exist. That's something mainstream American films almost never do, and there's something quietly riveting about it ...|Fresh
Despite its affection for the quirks of its characters and their milieu, the film is most memorable for its gravity, for the almost tragic nobility it finds in sad and silly circumstances.|Fresh
A critical favorite at Cannes, where it won the Prize Un Certain Regard, Rams will find an art-house audience among fans of Roy Andersson and Per Petterson.|Fresh
It's the rare international shepherd drama that feels urgently connected to contemporary American politics.|Fresh
A melancholy charmer that will make you laugh and bring you to tears.|Fresh
Every moment in writer-director Grmur Hkonarson's strange and wonderful film is imbued with mystery and revealing dignity.|Fresh
Hkonarson's film evolves into something increasingly compassionate, with matters culminating on a sincere, surprisingly moving note, that's both tender and tragic.|Fresh
A solidly effective story at the core of Grmur Hkonarson's off-beat comedy drama.|Fresh
Its combination of visual lyricism and naturalism allows Rams to transcend its parochial surroundings and posit universal questions about globalisation.|Fresh
Shines a light on a particular lifestyle desinged to be as a well oiled machine. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Simple, but its sociological and moral deviations are many and very suggesting. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of the best metaphorical films in years and at the same time an emotional bomb capable of shutting up even the loudest movie out there. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Fully captures the lifestyle of these rural communities where people sacrifice everything for their cattle. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's an elegant film full incongruously of low humour.|Fresh
A film that's emotionally complex and moving and using the best of its storytelling elements and sublime environment to tell this lovely narrative.|Fresh
Rams may sound bleak and unforgiving but it has a generous spirit and wit that make it entirely accessible.|Fresh
A small story about two old estranged brothers and their animals gently morphs from gentle near-absurdist comedy to something close to tragedy.|Fresh
Rams is a touching humanist drama set in a remote farming valley where two estranged brothers must come together to save what's dearest to them: their sheep.|Fresh
Sigurdur Sigurjnsson's and Theodr Jlusson's acting is exemplary, with Sigurjnsson's understated realism the key to the film's deep emotional resonance.|Fresh
"Rams really could have been about anything. The heart of the story is two brothers in the same business and how that business divides them. But they say ""write what you know"" and in Iceland they know sheep, so Rams is about two sheepherders."|Fresh
Rams is as curiously captivating as the bleak landscape in which the two protagonists site themselves.|Fresh
