The stories' dialogue... make us see the importance of remembering the child we were. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
We need more movies like this -- for children and adults.|Fresh
It's the interaction of a sanguine realism with a celebration of the liberating effect of the imagination that makes the magic happen. That, and the exquisite animation.|Fresh
This film, directed by Mark Osborne is multi-layered, with a story about a writer, an aviator, the Little Prince, and a young, modern day girl, who becomes friends with the aviator and who searches for the Little Prince told in the aviator's story.|Fresh
Perhaps it's best to think of it less as an adaptation and more as an appreciation of what the book has meant to the world since its initial publication.|Fresh
It is deeply personal and profoundly moving, a sensitive and affecting portrait of humanity.|Fresh
Rather than attempting a direct translation of the book's content, they've captured its spirit by threading elements of the story into a modern-day tale about the dangers of sacrificing wonder to technology and commerce.|Fresh
A very intelligent update of a classic that contributes by creating a whole new world. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Even though it's not a literal adaptation, respects the book by developing in different layers. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

A wonderfully creative, soul-soothing work.|Fresh
There is both a fragility and immediacy to the imagery-as if watching it might give you a paper cut.|Fresh
It can't help but be compared to the daring, challenging original.|Fresh
An instant classic for young and old, the film capitalizes on the themes of identity, what it means to grow up and the importance of staying curious with a gusto and enthusiasm that matches the film's young lead.|Fresh
Taken as one piece of art, as one beautiful, self-sustaining creation, this Little Prince is a thing of beauty.|Fresh
The film is admirable for its gentle hand when it comes to difficult subjects like the ephemeral nature of life, and its bold visual style, but it's also a film whose final reel seems unwilling to recognize the realities of its own story.|Fresh
The Little Prince should make a compelling, if not always fully incisive, case for clinging to the lessons of youth.|Fresh
The animation is gorgeous, with contemporary home life scenes in CGI and the world of The Little Prince in stunning stop-motion design.|Fresh
Saint-Exupery's core themes are never lost despite the contemporary context; rather they are enhanced by the Aviator's memories and the Little Girl's fresh experiences.|Fresh
The classic scenes redone gave me chills; the new stuff made me facepalm.|Rotten
...one of the most inspired, delightful animations of the year.|Fresh
Though it takes liberties with the source material, The Little Prince enriches the novella on which it is based, developing its themes and characters into one of the best animated releases of the year.|Fresh
Just lovely and poignant and all the other adjectives that make one's heart swell.|Fresh
"The Little Prince depends on its viewers' willingness to go along with twee flutterings like ""The stars are beautiful because of a flower that cannot be seen."" I'm too much of an adult to swallow that saccharine bilge, I guess."|Rotten
It's a film with charm and sweetness, but for me is structurally encumbered by this new present-day narrative level: the smarter, zappier modern animated style makes the marionette-style images of the past look a bit low-octane and quaint.|Fresh
Osborne respects the integrity of the original story in this charming adaptation.|Fresh
The Little Prince is a beautiful tribute to a timeless book.|Fresh
Lovely, slow, nostalgic and a bit over-rated.|Fresh
It's part-adaptation, part fan-fiction, part update. But it doesn't forsake the original.|Fresh
Animated take on classic tale is sweet but restrained.|Fresh
A delight for children and adults alike until it sadly spirals out of control in its overly ambitious finale.|Fresh
The Little Prince is a fond tribute, true to its source material and original unto itself.|Fresh
Mr. Osborne has done himself proud. What's essential in his film is the singular beauty of the first half.|Fresh
The film comes across as an homage and extravagant promo for the book.|Rotten
When the film hews to its source material, the results are enchanting, but the predictable and sentimental framing device around the slim tale undercuts the potency of the book's meditations on love and mortality.|Fresh
As fragile and beautiful as the beloved rose guarded by the wee fellow of the title.|Fresh
A creative and spiritual reworking of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's magical and enlightening 1943 novella.|Fresh
We've yet to get a masterpiece-level film adaptation of the classic novella The Little Prince, but if and until that day comes, this will do just nicely, thank you very much.|Fresh
A strange, satisfying, star-studded adaptation of the kid lit classic.|Fresh
At its inventive best-like the creation of a little cloth fox who never speaks but steals almost every scene he's in-it does capture the odd, tender wonder of [Saint-Exupry's] world.|Fresh
The whole movie's done with great skill and artistry, and while some of the original story's more philosophical moments have been toned down, they haven't disappeared.|Fresh
Better ... to think of this handsome, inoffensive Little Prince less as an adaptation than as a tribute-one that makes the relationship between the book and those who love it a central focus.|Fresh
Both parts of the movie work well, but they don't always work well together, especially in the final act.|Fresh
There's a lot of charm, thought and feeling in this film version. It expands on the original without dishonoring it.|Fresh
This inventive adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupry's children's book is beautifully realized in CG and stop-motion animation techniques.|Fresh
A wonderful surprise.|Fresh
I'd tell you to watch The Little Prince for its enchanting animation alone. That it's poignant, thoughtful, and warmly thrilling, that's just icing.|Fresh
A film that everyone should be happy to show their children.|Fresh
Osborne's take on The Little Prince shows a reverence for the original story, plus an understanding of what modern audiences want with a more linear story and bright animation.|Fresh
This terrific adaptation of the beloved children's book for adults features a passel of Hollywood voices, but they're beside the point.|Fresh
An ambitious gamble that looks like a sure bet commercially but which, artistically, shortchanges its source material.|Rotten
A very easy to watch film that will impact its audience without problems. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Mark Osborne's feature-length adaptation adds a dominant frame story that, at first, plays off the famous little fable (splendidly animated) within it quite nicely, only to overwhelm the original in its action-adventure third act.|Fresh
Even if the kids are left wanting more, purists will doubtless be pleased with Mark Osborne's reverential take on Antoine de Saint-Exupery's 1943 tale.|Fresh
"Perhaps ""The Little Prince"" isn't the direct take on the novella fans may be expecting, but with relaxed expectations, there's exceptional artistry and profound meaning to examine."|Fresh
As preachy and repetitive as The Little Prince can be, it offers enough moments of poetry to keep it flirting with greatness, or at least goodness.|Fresh
Being a soft adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's book, the film doesn't so much opt to tell the story verbatim, but rather celebrate its timeless nuance, reading it through contemporary lenses.|Fresh
It won't destroy your precious memories of Antoine de Saint-Exupry's classic, but you may feel a frisson of betrayal in the final moments that forces you to scan the bookcase back home for the original. Just to recapture that alien feeling.|Fresh
If what is essential is invisible to the eye, then The Little Prince has accomplished the impossible; it has made the invisible visible, and in 3D no less.|Fresh
Children and grown-ups who watch with their hearts will be rewarded with a very sweet film.|Fresh
A whimsical journey in favour of following dreams and finding life's true loves - a film for young audiences as well as for the oldies who've lost their way.|Fresh
This first feature screen animation of The Little Prince is a pleasure to behold, but as with any journey the venture is not without risk.|Fresh
To be fair, this homage to The Little Prince is a lovely story, lovingly told. And for the first two-thirds of the movie, it feels like one of the freshest animated films in ages.|Fresh
Saint-Exupry's darker tones and intense emotions are all here, echoing the Little Girl's own self-discovery in a dual narrative that dares to be more evocative and sophisticated than children are accustomed to.|Fresh
The makers of this animated update of The Little Prince approach Antoine de Saint-Exupry's classic with respect and imagination, with initially satisfying results.|Fresh
A gorgeously animated, poignant homage to the relationship people have formed over the years with Antoine St Exupery's book about the wonder that is childhood.|Fresh
While the scenes with the little prince and the aviator are whimsically charming, they fail to make up for the framing plot's trivialization of the source material, undermining the original story's beguiling, tragic quality.|Rotten
An homage to the story writen by Antione de Saint-Exupry, but mostly to those readers who have connected with the book. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Mark Osborne brings the innocence of the story and characters created by Saint-Exupry. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A cute and entertaining movie that will make viewers discover (or rediscover) tha magic of Antoine de Saint-Exupry's book. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There is a faith that the story and characters will keep the audience engaged, even if there isn't a bright and shiny thing to distract them in a every single scene.|Fresh
...for the most part the director takes the right liberties, ending up with an extremely beautiful, very charming, thematically rich take that's sure to be one of the better animated movies this year.|Fresh
This is a very good-looking film that represents a brave attempt to do justice to a very popular book; it manages it, just.|Fresh
This heartfelt bauble about a young girl facing the pressures of adulthood is constantly enlivened by its beautiful images, even if one itches for a narrative that's a little less rudimentary.|Fresh
Adds all manner of narrative bells and whistles to the author's slender, lyrical story of friendship between a pilot and a mysterious extraterrestrial voyager, but stays true to its timeless depiction of childhood wonderment ...|Fresh
