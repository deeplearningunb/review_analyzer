He visto un centenar de películas de terror en lo que llevo de vida, pero ninguna como The Witch. Nunca antes algo me había dejado tan estupefacto, extasiado, y aterrado. Todo al mismo tiempo.|Fresh
The film's sense of brooding, lurking menace is exceptionally chilling, precisely because director Robert Eggers entwines it with ordinary family life, and children being children.|Fresh
The Witch creates a world that feels stifling and claustrophobic, even though it's set in an open land with no one else around for miles.|Fresh
All of the strained stabs at supernatural ambiguity feel soulless. While certain visuals are undeniably frightening, most of the film fails to incite the kind of visceral sense of helplessness associated with the best horror films.|Rotten

The Witch is a good movie - a solid effort with several chilling moments from a director on the rise - but much like It Follows last year, this is not reinventing the wheel.|Fresh
Mark Korven's simple, sometimes dissonant score of heightened natural sounds and fiddle seems authentic, and raises the hair on the back of your neck, it's beautiful and fearsome by turns.|Fresh
The film's desperate search for a missing child combined with its arthouse sensibility suggests a Walking Dead episode directed by Bela Tarr.|Fresh

"""The Witch"" is an artistically striking film - it's truly a visual work of art. Unfortunately, it just couldn't decide if it was a psychological or paranormal horror film."|Rotten
Perhaps due to some sort of satanic intervention all of this comes from a director who had not yet created a feature film prior to The Witch.|Fresh
The Witch doesn't focus on shock or gore; instead it's visually stunning and completely engrossing -- and a true thriller, giving us more suspense than horror.|Fresh
For me The Witch was stunning, a brilliant tale that deserves to be a genre classic-but you should probably know what you're getting into.|Fresh
Sparse in dialogue and relentlessly bleak, The Witch will likely appeal to those who like their horror stripped back to basics, but boy does it pack a punch sometimes.|Fresh
There's plenty that beguiles in Robert Eggers' moody film The Witch.|Fresh

The Witch is unnerving to your bloodstream all the way to the very core of your heart, as Robert Eggers successfully demonstrates that he understands horror, and how to actually create something of artistic merit from the genre|Fresh
It's only when the family's livestock become involved that cracks appear in the earnest surface. I haven't cackled so much since the satanic goat in Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell.|Rotten
That the film climaxes with an inexplicable change of heart for a major character (or was it a reveal? It's impossible to tell for sure) suggests that Eggers may have taken from one too many sources to patch this thing together.|Rotten
Eggers is clearly first and foremost a film-maker rather than a historian and the urge to entertain eventually prevails.|Fresh
The Witch is an exceptionally well-made horror movie that relies on character-driven drama to create fear, not cheap gimmicks.|Fresh
[The Witch] convincingly makes us believe that such supernatural elements could be real, and that we are watching an account that feels terrifyingly of-the-moment.|Fresh
The Witch plays mercilessly on our dread of what might be lurking in the shadows, rather than actually showing much onscreen-and is all the more effective because of it.|Fresh
As in any good horror film, The Witch is ripe with allegorical possibilities.|Fresh
The Witch wants to be jump-out-and-scare-ya scary in addition to being dreadful-scary, but it's not.|Fresh
There are more interesting ways to explore how afraid we are of girl sexuality and how god-fearing Christians can use their faith for destruction.|Rotten
The Witch's brief jolts of violence seem perfectly calibrated to knock us out of our seats: not by generating horror on the screen, but within our viscera.|Fresh
"""The VVitch"" succeeds by delivering up encroaching menace with a mysterious disregard for audience expectations."|Fresh
One of the reasons The Witch works as well as it does is because, despite its name, the movie isn't a horrific folktale about a paranormal being, but rather a look into the depravity of what humanity can become.|Fresh
What's refreshing, and frightening, about The Witch is that Eggers allows no modern consciousness (scarcely any comic relief either) to intrude upon the anguish.|Fresh
The stakes are real. The Devil is real. All roads do not lead up the mountain. Some lead to the heart of darkness, to the depths of a witch-haunted wood.|Fresh
This isn't the kind of movie most horror fans are going to flock to.|Fresh
Set in Puritan era New England, The Witch is an atmospherically driven, religion-coated film that is, at times, both beautiful and terrifying.|Fresh

It's startling to see a movie with such an appreciation and aesthetic understanding of this too-infrequently filmed era.|Fresh
The Witch is a solid, compelling, thought-provoking movie.|Fresh
A slow-burn pace helps ratchet up the dread, along with the work of cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who casts the action in cold, gray, unforgiving light. And an exceptional cast makes it all resonate.|Fresh

Robert Egger's directorial debut is a deeply unsettling experience that will leave a residual impression akin to a scar on the skin.|Fresh
Robert Eggers ramps up the tension by setting his tale in a familiar-yet-foreign locale and using the natural terror of isolation to prompt chills and thrills from audiences.|Fresh
An oppressive, claustrophobic and occasionally shocking feminist tale that's just as much about a young girl coming of age in a fundamental Christian household as it is wicked, broomstick-riding evil lurking in the woods.|Fresh

A magnificent work of horror. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Witch does an excellent job in establishing its 1630s New England setting, but when it comes to the film's storyline, it's never quite able to reach the compelling and disturbing heights that writer/director Robert Eggers strives for.|Rotten

the effect [of The Witch] only works if it is immediately accepted that this is a film where Evil with a 'capital E' resides.|Fresh
Actors Ineson, Dickie and Anya Taylor-Joy exult in the archaic language, delivering powerful performances in this fairy tale of a family given a glimpse of the forces that lurk on the edge of the civilised world.|Fresh
The visual elements are key to the film. What scares the spectator is everything that you can't hear or see. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

At times it's like The Shining directed by Cotton Mather.|Fresh
Eggers keeps us enthralled with his film's mix of folktale eeriness and period authenticity.|Fresh
It's anything but a sure thing for mainstream horror audiences, a ride best taken with expectations in check and a healthy taste for metaphor.|Fresh
This is a super dark and depressing story. Though it is well acted, and it does have some emotional power, I would not recommend that anyone spend money to see this movie that tries to have its supernatural cake, and fake reality too.|Rotten

An intense supernatural thriller that is as anxiety-producing as it is geniunely unpredictable.|Fresh
Austere and haunting, the film's low-key twists and creepy imagery resonate afterward.|Fresh

Original and moody, especially in its strong start, The Witch is a must-see for all fans of spooky, stylish, supernatural horror.|Fresh
The Witch is a rare treat today: a horror movie that gripped me not because it is immediately gory but because of the ambiguous means in which it is told.|Fresh

There's no doubt that this is one of the best horror movies in recent history and that's a good thing for the genre. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Witch's scares are plentiful; it's just that many of them come after, once you're alone with your thoughts, and its disturbing images suddenly return to mind. The closing credits only cap the horror; they do not end it.|Fresh

One of the best (and creepiest) movies of the year so far.|Fresh
One of the best horror films I've seen in years. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Witch suggests rather than shows and leaves much to audience interpretation. For a horror film, it is mostly psychological; there are no jump moments and not much gore. It's clever and atmospheric and creepy.|Fresh

Anybody seeking torture porn or mindless jump shocks will be in for a disappointment, but Eggers's slippery, intelligent film is not short of accumulating unease.|Fresh
Spellbinding horror that drips with dread.|Fresh
Don't expect any jumpscares here or to leave the cinema particularly terrified. The Witch is a slow-burner of weirdness in the wilderness and unlike any recent horror film.|Fresh
Perfectly riding a knife edge of ambiguity, what is religious hysteria and what could be real is a guessing game sustained until the memorable climax.|Fresh
On the whole Eggers skilfully avoids too many classic horror-film tropes, as the family's already fervent belief in hell is insidiously, traumatically, reinforced.|Fresh
Like any outstanding horror film, its true impact only reveals itself once the credits have rolled and it stays buried under your skin, breaking through every now and then to remind you of its insidious power.|Fresh
The problem is that the craft and artistry are just too laboured and foregrounded.|Rotten
The best moments are early on.|Rotten
A hugely assured debut, The Witch is a beautiful, bleak brainworm that will haunt you for days.|Fresh
One of the scariest horror movies in years - and not the creep-up-and-prod-you kind of scary either, but a profound, unsettling dread that gnaws at your bones, and which comes back to find you in the dark.|Fresh
Eggers 'New England Folktale' exhumes the concept of the witch back from the primordial place we hid her; and it's as chilling as it is clever.|Fresh
It's a well played, pleasingly sinister film. Not outright scary for most of its runtime, and not perhaps what many fans of mainstream horror will be expecting, but it has the power to disturb.|Fresh
The payoff will keep your mind racing, and your face hiding under the covers, for days.|Fresh

Robert Eggers' measured, meticulous debut builds into one of the most genuinely scary horror movies of recent years.|Fresh

Artful and beautifully crafted little gem ... while it's creepy and atmospheric, it's as far from a rollercoaster of jump-scares as it is from a barrel of laughs.|Fresh
We leave it deeply unsettled, as if we've time traveled back into our ancestors' worst nightmares.|Fresh
A movie that looks great, builds immense atmosphere and then allows it all to putter out well before we are even close to reaching any significant momentum.|Rotten
This story about a 17th-century Puritan family struggling to survive at the edge of the wilderness becomes a dark American origin story: a beautiful promise, corrupted by fear and hypocrisy. The fruit is rotten; the milk bloody.|Fresh
Not to worry, the satanic entity found herein is not of the head-spinning, pea soup-spewing variety ... Eggers is too smart to recycle a Central Casting Lucifer.|Fresh
In this alternative history, the tension comes from the murky unknowns between true black magic and paranoia, because both are at play.|Fresh
There's a gut-wrenching sense of dread that saturates nearly every minute of director Robert Eggers' feature debut.|Fresh

"Haunting ""Witch"" effective Art House horror."|Fresh
Thoroughly in the 17th century, both in mood and content, The Witch is a compelling, frightening study in religious hysteria that is not without relevance to our own times.|Fresh
It's indie-horror as art-object, more than as suspenseful journey. Taken on those terms it is a major accomplishment.|Fresh
The Witch is a film that asks audiences to slide into the past and imagine the everyday haunting of missing children, failed crops and dark evils.|Fresh

"If you're looking for a movie that's better than hex, lay down with ""The Witch."" It's guaranteed to bewitch, bother and bewilder."|Fresh
this dour psychological thriller plumbs the depths of madness that human nature invites upon itself with a closed mind and a conviction of righteousness.|Fresh
"""...a consideration of evil without and evil within."""|Fresh
We fear such things because they're unnatural, a perversion of everything we know to be true about the world. The Witch renders them even more horrifying by suggesting that they are natural - that witches and spirits have been here all along.|Fresh
The Witch harbors several weighty themes, including the fear of the feminine mystique in a patriarchal society as well as the danger of placing too much faith in a puritanical belief without allowing other emotions an equal opportunity to breathe.|Fresh
The imagery of The Witch plunges into territory many films wouldn't even have the balls to consider. This is a hellish journey that scares and captivates in a slickly subtle way that is both satisfying and memorable.|Fresh
By pulling back the curtain and revealing the presence of the supernatural, The Witch ruins what could have been a stunning examination of the roots of why young women like Thomasin were accused of sorcery.|Rotten
All of this Eggers frames with a subconscious knack for creating tension within each shot, rarely relying on jump scares or gore, instead mounting suspense through one masterful edit after another.|Fresh
Taut, ripened with tension from start to finish, and anchored by a star-making performance from Anya Taylor-Joy, The Witch is a nightmarish exploration of female suppression and familial strife in pre-Colonial America.|Fresh
The Witch is effectively unpleasant and creepy, but it works better as a psychological thriller than a horror film.|Fresh
As if Ingmar Bergman and Ken Russell co-directed Kill List ... it's a delightfully insane bit of 17th century devilish fun.|Fresh
That may be part of what makes it so disturbing, even when Eggers doesn't set out to shock you: He's wrestling with something that we don't fully understand, but that we know in our gut is real.|Fresh
The Witch is so diabolically good that it sends genre expectations -- and appreciative members of the audience -- straight down the booby hatch.|Fresh
The key to 'The Witch' is that director Robert Eggers deals in dread, not scares. The audience is constantly watching in trepidation, not sure where the film will go next.|Fresh
It couldn't get any scarier, more satisfying or chilling.|Fresh
Its haunting effect comes from how Eggers uses this family as a vessel for serving up a fear that rests in the netherworld between reality and the unchained mind.|Fresh
One of the more notable horror films of the last few years. The Witch holds you in its grasp with a chilling exploration of how evil chooses some people to be its victims and others to do its bidding.|Fresh
The Witch isn't a horror film where the scares come from big spooky jolts, or from gore. No, The Witch is a horror film that creeps up on you, spreading its tendrils slowly across the landscape of your mind.|Fresh
Makes no bones about how Christian fanaticism in early America sometimes ran off the rails and plunged straight into the devil's playground.|Fresh
"This is the sort of horror film that I love, the kind that trades in cheap ""jump scene"" gotcha scares for psychological terror, unsettling mood and creepy atmosphere. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Nudity, etc. - Also Available)"|Fresh
The Witch is wrapped up in its own views of religion, of sin, of feminine power, but more than anything else, it is wrapped up in itself.|Rotten

A drama marketed as a horror movie, The Witch is sober, intelligent and not at all the kind of eerie creepshow its poster suggests.|Rotten
This is like watching -- in the biblical sense -- a King James version of a horror movie. It's getting critical raves but it made me want to go home and take a shower.|Rotten
One of the early contenders for the best film of 2016.|Fresh
Not especially horrifying, but a masterful exercise in godforsaken atmosphere.|Fresh
The film comes on the wave of enthusiastic reviews from last year's Sundance, and that should be the giveaway. What plays well there doesn't always work elsewhere.|Fresh
A feature debut of startling confidence, Robert Eggers's The Witch is not only an excellent horror film, but also a captivating study in extreme paranoia and the fragile bonds of family.|Fresh

The Witch is a stressful movie to watch, and that's meant as the highest praise.|Fresh

Shocking, eerie, doom-laden, and discomforting, it's a horror movie that truly gets under your skin.|Fresh
A film of deliberate pacing, painterly beauty and cold brutality, freshman director Robert Eggers' The Witch is a strange beast: a combination horror film and period piece that functions at the highest tier of both genres.|Fresh
I respect the film, but despite Eggers' best efforts, I had to fight off boredom at several points.|Fresh
The Witch is a beautifully photographed film for a psychological terror trip, with an ominous score that's the soundtrack of terror and performances that prove bewitching.|Fresh
The spooky stuff, of course, makes the journey all the sweeter, delivering what is, if not a terrifying experience, one that is at least thoroughly unnerving.|Fresh
In a uniquely twisted way, The Witch is a condemnation of religious fanaticism, as well as the stubbornness of ideas and ideals that comes with it.|Fresh
With a gentle rap-rapping, Mr. Eggers intensifies the shivers with art-film moves, genre shocks and an excellent cast that includes a progressively rowdy menagerie.|Fresh
The Witch is an expertly crafted look into madness, religion and why you probably shouldn't take a stroll in the woods.|Fresh
What appears to be a moody and earnest attempt at genuine horror transforms into a drab downer. A drama turned parable turned confused exploitation flick.|Rotten
The Witch immediately joins the pantheon of great horror movies, with the caveat that it's just barely a horror movie at all.|Fresh
This phenomenal debut feature by Robert Eggers has a singular style and tone, and its horror flows from the deepest wellsprings of human nature.|Fresh
Eggers doles out the horror sparingly and eerily: an image of blood in a milk pail, a moving shape in the shadow of a barn. The movie uses lamplight and hearth light to conceal as much as they reveal.|Fresh
It's a creepy little gem, and its imagery will stay with you long after you've left the theater.|Fresh
A hypnotic and psychologically engrossing picture.|Fresh
Building his film on the diabolical aftershocks of Puritan repression, Eggers raises The Witch far above the horror herd. He doesn't need cheap tricks. Eggers merely directs us to look inside. Be warned: It'll scare the hell out of you.|Fresh
A study in paranoia that creates a deepening mood of unease and dread...[and] despite a few stumbles (most notably a miscalculated final scene) is genuinely creepy.|Fresh
A near-masterpiece of creeping dread and hallucinatory imagery.|Fresh
Lots of horror flicks traffic in mere demonic trappings and symbols and Latin phrases. The Witch, however, truly feels like it was touched by a diabolical hand.|Fresh
The decision to raid primary sources was wise: it's hard to imagine a modern artist crafting a world of such dismal theological clarity and sincerity.|Fresh
What makes The Witch more than a mere museum reclamation project is Taylor-Joy.|Fresh

Period perfect, and deeply disturbing.|Fresh

Make no mistake, The Witch is a horror film, but it's as interested in the terrors we bring upon ourselves as it is the ones well out of our natural control.|Fresh
A low budget film that stays away from fact and explores myth and superstition around witchcraft, in a time and place between reality and imagination. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Witch is worth watching. Just don't get too wrapped up in the hysteria that surrounds it. As the film itself so admirably demonstrates, unquestioned passion and devotion doesn't tend to end particularly well.|Fresh
Incredibly unsettling. Art-house horror at its finest.|Fresh
Set among a family of Puritan exiles in the wilderness of unmolested New England as strange and ominous forces beset them, the film often looks more like historical realism than horror.|Fresh
An absolutely disastrous cinematic experiment...|Rotten
Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are painfully believable as a God-fearing couple desperately trying to rationalize the inexplicable, and Anya Taylor-Joy is simply stunning as their terrified, all-too-innocent eldest daughter.|Fresh

Above all else, The Witch benefits from the credibility of its performances.|Fresh
