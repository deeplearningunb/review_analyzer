A compelling and deep story about sadness, loneliness and isolation. I felt like a train had hit me after this. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
As a beautiful piece of art I admired it greatly and am still thinking about what it is trying to say and there's something to that.|Fresh
Lowery has achieved a work with transcendent impact. Fascinating in its representation of non-linear time, focalisation of narrative and meditation on grief, A Ghost Story is sure to cast its spectral presence long after the credits roll.|Fresh
Complicated ending; I liked it a lot...a bit in conflict with one specific theme of the movie, but in the right hands, its message will be very resonant.|Fresh
It may be full of missteps, but David Lowery manages to pack quite a bit of substance into a style of hipster filmmaking very uninterested in catering to basic audience demands.|Fresh
The film truly impressed me. Entangling, astonishing, and disorienting with its hazy, uncanny, spiritual viewpoint.|Fresh
A movie designed to make you feel by a writer-director too afraid to simply let you.|Fresh
A complex, dreamlike journey through the past, present and future, and one that makes you question your very existence in the enormity of the universe.|Fresh

The ghostly figure in the bed sheet is the perfect metaphor for the film itself-it looks haunting and intriguing, but it's mostly empty underneath.|Rotten
A Ghost Story is like one of the bedsheets in the film. It looks nice, it flows well, but like the bedsheet, there are some holes and major stains on it.|Rotten
The flaws & uneven nature don't betray the strong core that Lowery has constructed. ... What makes the film work is its meditation on the relationship between the dead & time.|Fresh
This extremely self-conscious, performance art-inflected piece that seems convinced of its own profundity is a largely unilluminating treatise on grief, mortality and history.|Rotten
A mostly meditative, haunting portrayal of grief, love lost and the homes we hold on to. Too bad a monologue pops up along midway to explain what we are already discovering for ourselves.|Fresh
Some will find writer/director David Lowery's opus to death and grief to be quite tedious and self-indulgent, while others will see this as a deeply profound and spiritual experience. I feel like it is a little bit of both.|Fresh
A Ghost Story isn't a crowd-pleaser by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a thoughtful and haunting work of filmmaking that attempts to tell a different kind of tale of the afterlife.|Fresh
A Ghost Story is a deceptively profound film like no other.|Fresh
This flick, above all else, is a showcase for the directorial talents of Lowery.|Fresh
What seems like a one-trick pony at first slowly metamorphoses into a metaphysical mood piece and tone poem, where grief is not merely relegated to the realm of the living, and time is upended from traditional structures.|Fresh
A very special achievement.|Fresh
"Hang in there, and ""A Ghost Story"" has rewards. Maybe plan your own pie snack to get you through some of those dialogue-free slogs."|Fresh

The star of this show is David Lowery, whose shot compositions and storytelling creativity are on full display.|Fresh
This movie makes you question what you would do if something this tragic happened to you, and how you would cope being this invisible, disembodied entity who can do nothing except watch life pass you by, and that rationalization is scary to imagine.|Fresh

Ghost story is more uncomfortable than disconcerting, more challenging than complacent, more a journey between times and spaces than an improbable puzzle... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's an offbeat narrative, and it demands patience, but it's so worth the wait in the final moments of the film, proving to be a graceful examination of love found and lost.|Fresh
This is a low-budget art film that is very thought-provoking, with big ideas about the nature of existence, death and time. It is wistful, imaginative, and unexpectedly emotional in its depiction of the transience of life.|Fresh
It stars a white cotton sheet, and it might make you cry.|Fresh

A Ghost Story turns out to be too arty for its own commercial good. Anyone hoping for another Truly Madly Deeply or Ghost is likely to be bitterly disappointed.|Rotten
... A Ghost Story feels like one of the most intimate pieces of moviemaking in years.|Fresh
David Lowery's A Ghost Story is an ambitious tale filled with gorgeous imagery and pieces of an intriguing narrative, but the film is ultimately let down by its lack of substance, which leaves you with a beautiful, yet somewhat forgettable, experience.|Rotten
In A Ghost Story, Lowery pulls off the neatest trick of all with this haunting image. He teases us with the idea that humanity survives into the afterlife.|Fresh
If a movie refuses to make linear sense, we expect to be affected on some deeper level that makes it all worthwhile. But [David] Lowery's narrative obscurity fails to make you feel anything.|Rotten
[Director] David Lowery's inventive film is a deeply affecting and unforgettable exploration of life, of love, and of grief, driven by a quite brilliant performance by Casey Affleck.|Fresh

David Lowery's latest explores existential anxieties through a spiritual, phantasmal and wholly original approach. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A Ghost Story is an atmospheric and thoughtful contribution to the ghost story genre and at first glance, it will have more appeal to the art-house crowd who might not otherwise take in a supernatural ghost story.|Fresh
We end up with a film that, for all its playfulness, connects plainly with the emotions.|Fresh
The work of a filmmaker conflating his biggest strengths and biggest weaknesses.|Rotten
This will infuriate some viewers, but the director is making a point, about time, how quickly it passes, and how casually and mindlessly we squander it.|Fresh
In short, I enjoyed a beguiling bittersweet wallow.|Fresh
It is beautifully shot, as if through a filter. There is minimal dialogue and Lowery plays with the ghost and haunted house tropes. It lit only fires of irritation for me and the stars' dowdy low-key love felt hardly worth a haunting.|Rotten
After a while, the things that irritated me about the film - the long takes, the boxy frame, the ironic costume - began to hit home.|Fresh
Completely unlike anything else you'll see this year.|Fresh
Pensive, precise and with an elegant, looping structure, this is a first-rate piece of direction from Lowery, who also wrote the screenplay.|Fresh
Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara star, but director David Lowery lets the sheet do the talking.|Fresh
It's a little inaccessible, perhaps, with long sequences of reflective silence, but A Ghost Story has a real emotional power that is sincerely haunting.|Fresh
So while[A Ghost Story] feels rather gimmicky and slow, at least its fiendishly original touches get our minds churning.|Fresh
[Casey] Affleck does an amazing job, managing to be hangdog while buried under a bedsheet for most of the film; how different would [A Ghost Story] be if he just hung around moping, without the linen?|Fresh
In my book it's one of the most brilliant, original films you will see this year.|Fresh
Soulfully scored and every bit as powerful in moments of discomforting silence, it's haunting indeed.|Fresh
It's such an original conceit, perfectly matched by the execution: the alternately plaintive and strange soundtrack, cinematography that places the stock spectral image into one gorgeously surreal frame after another, the performances.|Fresh
A perfect example of a good idea, half-baked.|Fresh
A haunting, beautiful film that is quite unlike anything else you'll see this year.|Fresh
Brilliantly shot and sound tracked mostly by sombre cello music, this is an aching and muted 92 minutes.|Fresh
A genuinely gorgeous and quietly upsetting fantasy drama.|Fresh
A bold experiment of a film that can only be called haunting.|Fresh
Essentially a metaphysical horror movie, it's low on traditional scares, but big on atmosphere, something intensified by how weird it all is.|Fresh
The movie is an utterly unique masterpiece, freighted with inchoate meaning and glimpses of eternity.|Fresh
I feel real love for this film and its lost wandering creature.|Fresh
A Ghost Story doesn't provide answers, but its simplicity and dignity is affecting and quite beautiful.|Fresh
This is a film with its own gentle logic. It's a quiet meditation on life, love, bereavement and the difficulty of letting go.|Fresh
You can't chase it from your mind. You can't exorcise it. The film stands there white-sheeted and eyeholed, staring into your soul and depths ...|Fresh
Lowery's film has the same deadpan, unreadable quality as that white-masked face. But the shroud is worn as elegantly as the film's own ambition and audacious simplicity.|Fresh
The film won't be for everyone, but it's a unique take on the ubiquitous cinematic theme of death and what happens after it, and deserves to be seen.|Fresh
A melancholy love story and a rumination on the passage of time.... Has a great beauty to it, notwithstanding some patience-trying stretches.|Fresh
It is both quietly brilliant and brilliantly quiet; imagine a recent Terrence Malick film with less cinematography and more plot.|Fresh
Extraordinary. One of the year's most original and best films.|Fresh
Like an arthouse Ghost, this is bold, original filmmaking with a pervasive sense of amused detachment.|Fresh
For the most part, Lowery has crafted a captivating reflection on the enormity of mankind's existence and the tiny part we each play in it.|Fresh
This is a story that sticks.|Fresh
A Ghost Story is about more than love, grief and frenzied pie eating. It's about whether any of us has a reason to exist, pre- or post-decease.|Fresh
David Lowery's A Ghost Story is a thought experiment that requires viewers to meet it halfway - with the reward being a powerful musing on the pull of love over time.|Fresh
... a different sort of haunting, a quiet reverie of never letting go of people, places, anything. Some viewers may think it silly, others profound, but there's no other movie quite like it.|Fresh
It demands patience and an open mind, but Lowery's return to his indie roots after Pete's Dragon is a highly unusual and, at times, emotionally shattering fable.|Fresh
The living and the dead share a space but little else, and Mara captures the flickering needle of grieving. The effect is not pretentious but more often sadly sweet; the separation makes their longing swell.|Fresh
Thus far, A Ghost Story is the most thoughtful cinematic depiction of what happens when we die.|Fresh
An art-house Rorschach test that demands a specific type of moviegoer in a precise mood for cosmic puzzling.|Fresh
Imbues the horror genre with a rare degree of poetic elegance while ruminating on the nature of time, memory and grief...Lowery's mournful, strangely moving film is likely to haunt you.|Fresh
Moving at the speed of molasses trying to drip UP a wall, the movie clocks in at just over 90 minutes, yet many fidgety viewers will swear it runs at least four hours. Yet for those who can get attuned to its leisurely approach, it's a fascinating watch.|Fresh
A stunning philosophical film without compromise. Lowery's A GHOST STORY is so original, daring and slow that it returns the medium of film into the hands of the director.|Fresh
Much, much more than just the human equivalent of a ghost emoji standing in an Instagram snap... one of the most astute depictions of grief to reach cinemas in a long time.|Fresh
If you go with him into the grief and the loneliness, he will deliver something elegiac, poetic and emotional. If you do not, he is the man from pseud's corner, playing with the camera like a child.|Fresh
A wounded, wondrous poem of a picture about many things, not limited to the needfulness of coupledom, loss, lingering, the parsing of love, the passing of language.|Fresh
A hypnotic, almost meditative look at love, loss and legacy.|Fresh
The title of director David Lowery's A Ghost Story is about as concise a description as you're going to find for a surreal and beautiful film that explores a kaleidoscope of themes and issues.|Fresh
Daniel Hart's lush score alternates between almost ethereal heights of violins to the sombre, heavier cellos as we witness the couple's physical versus spiritual connections.|Fresh
Some movies are valuable because they provide answers. This one works because it asks tough questions, then leaves it up to the audience to do the heavy lifting.|Fresh
Lowery finds power in the image's very absurdity ... [The ghost] is so silent, so slow and so often still, that it becomes first arresting, then poignant, and finally unbearably sad.|Fresh
Somehow it works, even though Lowery doesn't make it terribly easy for the audience.|Fresh
A meditative and even spiritual experience.|Fresh
Lowery's low-budget reimagining of a haunted house film is strange and lovely, creepy and sad, and there are moments when you can't quite believe you're sitting in a theater watching it.|Fresh
"How the titular ghost reveals its timelessly intriguing ""story"" is a little weird to be sure. Still, even if you don't believe in ghosts, just see it to consider how really haunting life can be."|Fresh
It's hard to quantify the audacity it took for David Lowery to make this film. It's a ghost story, a haunting meditation on life, loss, and mankind's place in the universe, that features a man under a sheet with the eye holes poked out.|Fresh
A Ghost Story is a minor movie miracle. It does something utterly ridiculous and it not only gets away with it but it builds on it to make the movie one of the most conceptually audacious of the past few years.|Fresh
It remains a failure, though a fascinating one because it's so unusual and borne of the filmmaker's ambition.|Rotten
Some credit is due for artistic courage and craftiness on Lowery's part for this low-budget wonder, but ultimately A Ghost Story doesn't hang together in any substantive way.|Rotten
A Ghost Story rewards viewers who are willing to engage with it, to accept its evolving premise and experience the expressionless specter's afterlife as it reveals itself.|Fresh
There's supposed to be something there in A Ghost Story, but I can't see it. I see dread, people.|Rotten
Though the name implies it, A Ghost Story is not a fright fest. Still, it does provide some scares, albeit subtle ones, by showing what life after death could entail, both for a lost soul and the one(s) it left behind.|Fresh
Stick with it and you will be treated to what very well may be the year's most unique cinematic vision.|Fresh
Lowery delivers a layered and moving meditation on grief and the passage of time, all while his lead actor is mute under a white shroud (with eyeholes).|Fresh
isn't completely fulfilling, but that's never the point of the film|Fresh
I didn't expect that Lowery -- or anyone -- would come close to the touching inventiveness of my favorite film from the beyond, Hirokazu Kore-eda's After Life.|Fresh
Lowry has a well-developed eye for inventive storytelling thanks to his background in micro-budget shorts. His vision is on full display here, and the result is one of 2017's most powerful films.|Fresh
While a steady flow of utter helplessness and heartbreak cascades through this unusually affecting movie, so too do warm currents of humour and hope.|Fresh
Lowery never loses control of the tone of his film, which leaves a profound sense of the fleetingness of life that you'll find hard to shake.|Fresh
Of the many reasons to treasure David Lowery's new film A Ghost Story, one of the biggest is the way it outlines the shape not just of one human life, but of human life in general.|Fresh
(The film) is about insubstantiality. As a character ... explains, nothing lasts - not books, not art, not culture, not people and not relationships. Everything is a slave to time that keeps its own pace and cares nothing for manmade or natural creations.|Fresh
A Ghost Story longs to be a commentary on human legacy, loss and existence. It never fully achieves that goal, but it is nevertheless worth enduring aesthetically to reach what it's positing philosophically.|Fresh
It is a film of big ideas and questions rather than one built around formulas for cheap scares, which is an important distinction to consider before seeing it.|Fresh
Those who tune into the strange frequency of A Ghost Story will be grandly rewarded. Just know, first and foremost, in this ghost story, all the haunting is conducted by linen.|Fresh
"The ""story"" of the movie is barely there, but the feelings it evokes are as haunting as its parade of lost spirits."|Fresh
Most impressively, this Story is good at capturing that sense of ineffable connection with what has come before us and what persists when we are gone. The living part's a little weak, though.|Fresh
Such a meditative movie certainly isn't for everyone, but it is what an indie movie should be: bold, original, quirky, genre-defying, and boundary pushing.|Fresh
Lowery's story never what it looks like it is going to be, all of it building to a revelation where the answer to a question isn't nearly as important as the effect it has upon the entity who has spent incalculable lifetimes searching for it.|Fresh
Such a simple, wonderful idea, executed perfectly|Fresh
A Ghost Story is the most unusual and loneliest phantasm saga ever to give you the shivers.|Fresh
An often jaw-droppingly audacious and singular piece of work...|Fresh
It's definitely an actual ghost story, but, while it's haunting, it's certainly not a horror. Instead, as its rather perfect tagline posits, it's all about time.|Fresh
A hypnotic, melancholic low-budget meditation on love, heartbreak and memory.|Fresh
As meditations on the banality and helplessness of grieving go, the movie makes a powerful statement.|Fresh
No, A Ghost Story isn't a horror movie -- unless you connect to the horror of the world moving on without you. In which case, yeah.|Fresh
It is profound, peculiar, frustrating, frightening, transfixing, maddening, and, mostly, beautiful.|Fresh
While light on traditional narrative, there is a fulfilling journey here, and if you don't start hating the film as soon as it begins, it'll likely leave you shaken.|Fresh
Like a tough crossword puzzle, it challenges the mind, stimulates the brain and conjures a strong feeling of satisfaction when you think you've finally got a handle on it. Surprise! You probably don't.|Fresh
With little use for the cinematic conventions that humans have relied upon for over a century, it makes every romantic comedy, superhero flick, or Oscar-bait tearjerker feel like a relic from an ancient past, and boy, has it arrived just in time.|Fresh
Cinematographer Andrew Droz PalermoIt's camera immerses you in extended minutes of muted color and light, the space between objects in any given frame more resonant than any action.|Fresh
This very special movie casts a fine, delicate spell; many may resist it, but those who go along with it may find themselves profoundly moved, transported to a soul-stirring, poetically cosmic place.|Fresh
You have got to be kidding me. The Ghost and Mrs. Mara? Casey the Friendly Ghost? This Emperor has no sheets?|Rotten
Lowery's greatest success is in keeping this intentionally spare story from feeling like a gimmick.|Fresh
A moving and minimalist ghost story that delivers food for thought about travels through time and the art of letting go.|Fresh
As years rush by the ambitions grow increasingly more cosmic and grand. This little low-budget film begins to contain multitudes.|Fresh
As pretentious as it sounds, A Ghost Story is more about a feeling, an emotional response to a singular cinematic experience.|Fresh
A Ghost Story demands thorough and, at times, frightening introspection on the nature of existence.|Fresh
"Might result in you first fidgeting, then checking your watch, and ultimately grasping at your hair while screaming ""For the love of Patrick Swayze, get to the point already!"" (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - Available)"|Rotten
A wondrous, delicate shell of a movie|Fresh
The premise and the framework of the story and the photography are much more memorable than the performances, and that feels mostly by design.|Fresh
A Ghost Story fairly pulses with a tender regard for the precious fragility of any domestic shelter, from the frontier to the high-rise.|Fresh
I was still knuckling my forehead in skepticism through to the last few minutes. But that's when the film's mournful ache abruptly feels earned, and its mysteries become tangible. Days later I was still thinking of Lowery's inspired imagery|Fresh
A beautiful, haunting ode to the impermanence of everything-and the precious, mundane, sometimes mysterious moments that make up the music of life.|Fresh
Lowery pushes the tropes of the haunted house film past the breaking point, creating something that is entirely original - and oddly, if not profoundly unsettling.|Fresh
Cryptic enough to spark a conversation, cut-and-dried enough to ensure that's short one.|Fresh
A Ghost Story may be thinly plotted, but it's thick with introspection, dodging any easy interpretation. It may well be all about time, but as C learns, time isn't as useful as we might have thought.|Fresh
This film squanders nothing and rushes very little.|Fresh
Like a wild, sonorous piano chord struck by someone or something in the middle of the night--where did that come from?--the contemplative aura of A Ghost Story sticks with you.|Fresh
A Ghost Story can seem more like a creative exercise than a fully formed narrative construct.|Fresh
A Ghost Story seems to be telling us that time is cyclical, and that the sphere of existence most easily seen by the living is an illusion. Other, more coherent films have put forth that concept more gracefully.|Rotten
"The enigmatic view of the afterlife is mingled with sadness and loneliness, making you root for the ghost who is waiting for ""something"" but that something becomes a lost memory."|Fresh
It's doubtful we'll see a more beautifully-shot feature this year, if not for longer.|Fresh
A surreal, hypnotic and ethereal meditation on life, love, loss, and the questions we keep asking . Casey Affleck is covered in a white sheet and Rooney Mara eats a whole pie in one shot. Not to be missed.|Fresh
...inverts most ghost stories by giving us a specter who is haunted by the living.|Fresh
Bewitching, romantic, lyrical, and unquestionably original, A Ghost Story is a convoluting watch that leaves you feeling satisfied, even if you don't understand why.|Fresh
although his new low budget indie echoes the works of others, particularly Hirokazu Kore-eda's ruminations on time and the after life, the film's style is unique, its most startling aspect how moving Affleck is beneath a sheet.|Fresh
At its heart, A Ghost Story is a universally relatable story about grief on an intimate scale, transplanted onto a more epic canvas than you would have ever imagined possible.|Fresh
A Ghost Story leads you down a path that allows for personal reflection, which will either sooth lost souls or scare them away.|Fresh
Even at its most self-conscious, there's something lovable about A Ghost Story.|Fresh
If you have the patience it's a rewarding, frequently poignant film that evokes the loneliness of the human experience... After all, each of us will be under that white sheet one day.|Fresh
It's an honest-to-goodness experimental movie, a story that starts going in one direction and unexpectedly veers into unexplored territory, rewriting its rules as it goes.|Fresh
Though Casey is earnest in his attempt to convey a range of emotions from under the sheet, ultimately, it's the cinematic equivalent of watching a little kid try to fight his way out of a paper bag.|Fresh
A Ghost Story is a poetic statement on the passage of time and on eternity that thoughtfully ponders the spiritual, circular history of places and objects.|Fresh
Even when it's difficult to grasp exactly what it's trying to say in some of its more head-scratching segments, the film commands appreciation for its vision and audacity. You might not see ghosts the same way again.|Fresh
An interesting, if obtuse exploration of existentialism... it's a film that is sure to divide audiences: some may marvel at the aesthetic notions while others may dismiss it as bunkum, weird stuff. I lean towards the latter..|Rotten
I loved everything about it, including the scenes I wasn't sure how to take.|Fresh
Opening in domestic contentment, moving through personal anguish and ending with a cosmic lament, it's a simple, wrenching story of love and loss that pries open a window onto eternity.|Fresh
If you're patient ... C's wordless vigil will send you away with a shivery melancholy that defies easy explanation.|Fresh
Their missed connection, divided by the void of human existence, is also a beautifully sad and poignant representation for the ways in which we all strive or fail to connect in the present.|Fresh
Alternately child-like and artful, A Ghost Story holds you in thrall - get into Lowery's rhythms and the movie will touch you deeply. The minimalist performances of Affleck and Mara are mesmerizing|Fresh
There are mysteries here, not the least of them being how such a modest little movie can evoke such profound feelings.|Fresh
A Ghost Story isn't coherent or profound, but it's pretty and strange-sad in its quirky way, and blessedly short.|Fresh
Though it possesses a mournful beauty, A Ghost Story is sullied by (Casey) Affleck's presence.|Rotten
"It won't scare you; it doesn't even say ""boo."" But glowing light and ghostly soulfulness linger on like a quiet, scratching presence that won't leave you."|Fresh
Tlthough the spirit here is willing, I'm sorry. This film is just weak.|Rotten
In its brief sojourn on the screen, A Ghost Story moves through centuries of geologic time and into the deepest recesses of the human heart.|Fresh
"For its first hour, ""A Ghost Story"" is a top-notch contribution to the grief genre. It's right up there with ""Truly Madly Deeply."""|Fresh
Just when you think you've cracked the film's circumscribed logic, it opens up and goes wild in ways at once too wondrous and too preposterous to spoil.|Fresh
A cosmically connected masterpiece, deceptively simple in design yet awe-inspiring in its philosophical vastness.|Fresh
A wrenching, remarkable masterpiece about love and loss, life and death, from one of America's great directors.|Fresh
The questions that Lowery raises hang in the air, like motes of dust, long after the movie is done.|Fresh
Beautiful and deeply affecting, A Ghost Story is easily the greatest movie ever made with an Oscar winner standing around in a white bedsheet for most of its 87-minute runtime.|Fresh
An empty exercise in imitative long-take aestheticism, A Ghost Story fills its distractingly round-cornered frame with endless repetitions on a visual gag.|Rotten
Maddening, inscrutable, and alienating.|Rotten
I found it difficult to continue suspending my disbelief.|Rotten
This is really about the quiet life of a ghost, haunting a house where contentment once lived. Bring patience - and a fondness for Malick-ish stillness - and perhaps find reward.|Fresh
A Ghost Story, the work of a filmmaker in creative effervescence, is the organicity with which the minimalism of its internal elements causes a maximalism of existential discourses. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A Ghost Story is an exquisite, thoughtful, moving and truly wonderful piece of cinema|Fresh
Lowery's film haunts with its highly localised perspective on human history, as it goes/stays on a quest for a scrap of deferred meaning.|Fresh
After seeing this film, I have determined that I want to live inside the mind of David Lowery. He is one of the most inventive directors of this generation and is capable of making great films no matter how big or small.|Fresh
A beautiful film in total control of the cinematic medium.|Fresh
It's fabulous movie-making, but would perhaps not make for the best date-night flick, if you had any designs.|Fresh
A Ghost Story is a bit of a downer in its execution and functionality, but I appreciate the way Lowery wasn't afraid to try and do something wholly against the grain by giving us a new perspective on the realm of the supernatural.|Fresh
The collision of aesthetics -- a cartoonish, Halloween-costume-grade specter haunting a quiet indie -- is the point where A Ghost Story asks the most of us. But how thrilling it is to be jostled.|Fresh
Lowery clearly has a great deal of passion for this material and he throws everything he has into each frame.|Fresh

Experimental and utterly compelling.|Fresh
