An intriguing little psychological thriller where the drama rises as the mystery deepens. The three leads are very good, especially Goodman.|Fresh
It's thrilling and unique, perfectly holding the line between action/thriller and a cerebral chamber drama. When the film does finally reveal all its cards, it's a satisfying adrenaline rush.|Fresh
Every element in 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE compliments the other. The nuances in the performances add to the concept, while the action provides a launch pad for Winstead's cunning performance or Goodman's threatening presence.|Fresh

There's a lot of great things I can say about 10 Cloverfield Lane but, even if brief, a problematic ending can spoil an otherwise good film.|Fresh

Excellently shot, with cramped meaning squeezed into every frame, it plays with viewers like only a good film can.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane remains a staunch believer in the old horror tenet of the unseen and unspoken being infinitely more terrifying than anything made explicit.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane was a delightful ride, full of amusing scary bits and actors who are interesting to watch. Ultimately the biggest problem with 10 Cloverfield Lane was its sham of a marketing campaign.|Fresh
It makes me sad that the only way they could get people to come see this new movie is by branding it with the name of a previous hit.|Rotten
There were absolutely no moments in this film where I thought the events were predictable.|Fresh
There are a number of intense sequences all heightened by actors at the top of their game|Fresh
The camerawork perfectly captures their closed surroundings, with tight angles, thereby accentuating dramatic tension. Winstead's performance is also amazing, evoking both empathy and intensity with equal ease. Don't miss this gem of a thriller.|Fresh
It's a decent piece of low-budget film-making that shows what you can do with artfully built tension, skilful editing and a handful of shocking moments. Buckle up, because the first one comes early on.|Fresh
This movie is really good and deserves to be taken on its own merit, but because Cloverfield is invoked in the title, a lot of people expected a literal sequel.|Fresh
The latest film to appeal to the worst in human nature is 10 Cloverfield Lane.|Rotten
"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" manages to accomplish the rare feat of. . .still retaining the bare-bones structure, simplicity of thrills and chills that made its predecessor such an effective surprise eight years ago."|Fresh
Cloverfield, is a gut-clenching, heart-racing experience that doesn't let up the level of intensity it instills in the audience for even a minute.|Fresh
The majority of the movie's fun comes from its surprises; from never really knowing where the characters stand, or where it's going to end up.|Fresh
It's well acted, nuanced, and surprisingly effective. A definite must-see thriller.|Fresh
A movie that has a seventies sci-fi vibe but is in the thriller where it has its greatest achievements. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Maybe it's not an obvious sequel, but this film certainly has the same spirit as Cloverfield, keeping viewers guessing until the last shot.|Fresh
It works best whenever Goodman swaggers into frame, a slack-jawed psycho with a cuddly side.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane arrives as proof that, between the bloated junk and commercial no-brainers, the studio system can still surprise us.|Fresh
Winstead and Goodman are both great, but there are quite a few niggling aspects, too. They include the conclusion, a bolted-on section that might leave you wondering if the film would have been better off with no ties to the Cloverfield brand.|Rotten
The film is strong. More than strong enough to stand on its own. There was no need to try peg it to Cloverfield's brand. In the end, that's the one thing that weakens it.|Fresh
Before it's done, 10 Cloverfield Lane takes an unexpected turn or two. So don't be fooled by a bit of rope-a-dope pacing; by the end, the movie delivers a strong punch.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie-lover's wet dream. It boldly tackles still to this day taboo issues of alcoholism while also being a straightforward thriller.|Fresh
A reasonably fast-paced thriller that manages to keep us confused about where precisely it's going even though where it's generally going could not be any more obvious.|Fresh
A real meat and potatoes proposition -- satisfying *and* tasty!|Fresh
When sequels, even lateral ones, outdo their originals, it's a good thing. This is a good thing.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane might not be a true sequel to Cloverfield, but that doesn't make it any less magnificent, watching it a spellbinding treat I simply did not want to see come to an end.|Fresh
Set in the same universe as the 2008 monster-focused blockbuster, 10 Cloverfield Lane focuses tightly on a trio of survivors, with solid fear and tension.|Fresh
[10 Cloverfield Lane is] alternately hilarious and terrifying, horrifying and tender.|Fresh
All you need to know is that you should see it as soon as you can. It's fantastic.|Fresh
The one-bunker setting ultimately proves only a little more novel a trick than Cloverfield's shaky cam, and its pressure to deliver the goods lets it down.|Rotten
"A word to the wise; if you go into this film looking for the monsters from J.J. Abrams film ""Cloverfield"" you may be disappointed. However, if you are in the mood for a small and satisfying thriller, then brave the bunker at ""10 Cloverfield Lane."""|Fresh
It's a mix of high concept premise and old school thriller and director Dan Trachtenberg makes it all work nicely in his feature debut.|Fresh
Both Winstead and Gallagher Jr. are great as the young bomb shelter roomies, but it's Goodman's film. He's a Stephen King-style character -- affable and menacing, with both a cheery bonhomie and a hair-trigger temper.|Fresh
Its plot is finely calibrated and its atmosphere cannily climate-controlled. A deliciously terrifying treat to swallow down, hard, with a gulp.|Fresh
To tell you all the reasons why 10 Cloverfield Lane is so great would spoil it for you, and this is a movie experience that deserves to be completely unspoiled.|Fresh
There is an atmosphere of slow, creeping dread all throughout the film, like the anticipation of creatures around the next corner.|Fresh
Lane mimics the best episodes of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone where whatever supernatural terrors might be at play, the greatest menace is the man standing next to you.|Fresh
John Goodman brings his A-game to the part of the tightrope-walking Howard who is at times kind and gentle and at others unhinged and cuckoo. Mary Elizabeth Winstead matches him note for note.|Fresh

10 Cloverfield Lane is a three-act stage drama masquerading as a psychological thriller, which, by the time act three rolls around, evolves into a whole different kind of beast.|Fresh
A claustrophobic and apocalyptic thriller that surpasses the very good 2008 film that inspired it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Using themes like paranoia and mistrust, this is an intelligent and thrilling film. It has element of theatre that allows the cast to give great performances. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A high tension and highly original film where John Goodman gives one of his best performances ever. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Trachtenberg bets it all on the leads performances and a visual style made of first person shots, cenital shots and closed frames, making this a very claustropobic film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

In a promising debut, director Dan Trachtenberg abandons not only the original's structure, but also its genre. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
Until its final ten minutes, this is a dazzling, absorbing, sometimes unbearably tense thriller, an efficient and precise three-hander that rarely takes a false step.|Fresh
Smart, tense and surprisingly pared down.|Fresh
A film that willfully punts audience patience and goodwill into the stratosphere in its closing reel.|Rotten
With its small budget, high-concept premise and breakthrough-director feel, it brings to mind works such as Moon (2009), District 9 (2009) and Saw (2004).|Fresh
It wouldn't be fair to tell you too much.|Fresh
All of the performances deliver, with Winstead coming off as a reliable horror-lead, while Goodman, saddled with an empty stare and unpredictable temper, is the true star of the show.|Fresh
The payoff can't match the build-up, and it leaves too many unanswered questions along the way.|Rotten
10 Cloverfield Lane is a small movie that takes big risks, and all of them pay off.|Fresh
Fear and tension are palpable as the psychological games play out, and when we get complacent with life in the bunker Trachtenberg throws in curveballs that often deliver a good fright, but the big reveal is a touch predictable.|Fresh
This ingenious and claustrophobic thriller is compact enough to be almost the movie equivalent of a black box theater production: For most of its length, it needs only three characters and a single location to keep audiences on edge.|Fresh
Rather than a sequel or spin-off, this is a spiritual successor to 2008's Cloverfield, a terrifically tense thriller that builds a genuine sense of horror.|Fresh
Dan Trachtenberg's low-budget suspense thriller is one big plot hole.|Rotten
If Hitchcock had ever directed an episode of The Twilight Zone, it might have looked something like this.|Fresh
the cinema of delight|Fresh
Goodman, too often a worthy supporting player, delivers a captivating performance defined by menace and delusional altruism, but there's a shortage of doubt or even just conflicting allegiances in the screenplay.|Fresh
As a pilot episode for a TV series this could work, as a film its pretty weak. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
"Like an extended episode of ""The Twilight Zone."""|Fresh
Dan Trachtenberg's 10 Cloverfield Lane is that rare kind of surprise: an event movie that delights by virtue of its smallness, its ingenuity and the fact that you'll know very little about it going in.|Fresh
A wonderful and welcome surprise, a visit to 10 Cloverfield Lane is highly recommended.|Fresh
Trachetenberg beautifully executes the claustrophobic three-handed drama... steadily ratcheting the tension as the mood inside the bunker slides back and forth between black comedy and white-knuckle scares.|Fresh
Thrilling, daring and stimulating, in simple words: perfect entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Keeps the viewer holding his breath for the whole running time. A big surprise. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Make no mistake: while this three-hander cannot possibly pass the Bechdel test, it is nonetheless driven by real feminist concerns, as Michelle has an awakening in the prisonhouse of patriarchy.|Fresh
A fine and slyly witty low-budget thriller.|Fresh
Trachtenberg's outing is taut, slippery and tremendous value for money. Winstead is all doe-eyed grit right up to and beyond the film's final detonations.|Fresh
If you've seen CLOVERFIELD you will love this follow-up. If you haven't, you will love this follow-up, stand-alone horror-thriller. It's got a smart female victim!|Fresh
Skilfully directed by first-timer Dan Trachtenberg, it's overlong and doesn't sustain the intrigue throughout but an explosion of tension towards the end results in a gripping, if preposterous, finale.|Fresh
A tightly controlled tale in which a smart premise is executed to its full potential, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very welcome surprise and one that will have you biting your fingernails until the very last moments.|Fresh
All three cast members play their roles to a tee, with Goodman walking a thin line between threat and pathos, while Winstead does a terrific job of leading the audience through the increasingly outlandish revelations of the plot.|Fresh
An intimate suspense play, executed with great cinematic virtuosity by Trachtenberg.|Fresh
a sharp, tense thriller of admirable economy|Fresh
Reinvigorating the horror genre with a slick deconstruction that parses the subtleties of the patriarchy and the perils of the nuclear family|Fresh
As a feature-length tease, the movie is good fun.|Fresh
It's a good movie, but not anything to get all that worked up about.|Fresh
There are unexpected twists, surprising turns, and you have no idea what is going to happen from scene-to-scene. It held my attention throughout.|Fresh
Like Michelle, you're evaluating what Howard has to say, with little evidence one way or the other.|Fresh
Goodman is responsible for most of the film's tension. Over the years he's demonstrated a knack for playing likable and sinister, funny and serious, but not often all of those at once and rarely with the force he does here.|Fresh
There's no excess, no fat, and the result is a gut-wrenching film with two towering central performances that you're not likely to forget in a hurry.|Fresh
"This is a horror movie with a difference: It's genuinely horrifying, not just ""scary."" In fact, cheap scares are few, replaced by a mounting sense of dread and foreboding that gnaws at the pit of the stomach."|Fresh
In an era of bloated blockbusters, 10 Cloverfield Lane is refreshingly pared down -- a chamber piece rather than an epic.|Fresh
A wildly entertaining genre mash-up.|Fresh
... gets into our heads because that's where the scariest stuff happens... It's Room without motherly instinct shielding her son and the audience from bad things happening. Yet much funnier, in a nervous sort of way.|Fresh
"With its slow burn and richer characters, 10 Cloverfield plays on a whole different set of fears, about the bad things that can happen in ""safe"" spaces."|Fresh
A little pre-Trump paranoia that's a reflection of our collective anxieties delivered as an easily digestible thriller.|Fresh
The cast are superb but the biggest plaudits go to Goodman who is phenomenal, giving one of his finest performances. This sharp, slick shocker is massively entertaining.|Fresh
There's plenty here to intrigue and eventually terrify thanks to a script that keeps us guessing about what really has unfolded above ground.|Fresh
I loved it until the last ten minutes, which somehow manage to be disappointing and exhilarating.|Fresh
I was on the edge of my seat and then I was on the very edge of my seat, and then I fell off my seat and discovered a ledge beyond the edge and I was on the edge of that.|Fresh
Effectively self-contained psychological horror bursts into full-blown science fiction in director Dan Trachtenberg's robust debut feature.|Fresh
Trachtenberg lulls viewers into a complete sense of insecurity with a neatly executed three-hander that confines itself almost entirely to a single subterranean bunker.|Fresh
A marvelous little movie: compact, efficient, almost unbearably intense, smartly (perhaps accidentally) feminist. A glorious treat of pulp genre fun.|Fresh
After a particularly dull Oscar season, this is a refreshing and extremely satisfying palette cleanser.|Fresh
With a horrifying scenario, a resilient heroine and an insistent score by composer Bear McCreary, the super-secret J.J. Abrams production drops a new nightmare.|Fresh
Happily, 10 Cloverfield Lane proves a wildly effective white-knuckle affair, replete with twists, turns and terror.|Fresh
The movie . . . plays gleeful tricks with our expectations, pulling us back and forth among belief, suspicion and tension.|Fresh
I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me like they took a small story about people trapped in a basement, slapped some Cloverfield-like events on it ad hoc and then marketed the movie to us in a shameful cash grab.|Rotten
"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" gets the job half done."|Rotten
By the end, 10 Cloverfield Lane feels like a marketing plan posing as a movie.|Rotten
A big budget is not the key to a hit movie. Smart writers and filmmakers are. 10 Cloverfield Lane proves it.|Fresh
You didn't see it coming. You won't know where it's going. That is the selective takeaway from 10 Cloverfield Lane, a shrewdly efficient thriller from first-time filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg.|Fresh
It's a small film crafted beautifully to create a claustrophobic nightmare that can stand alone as a quality thriller or as a companion piece for those looking to make a Cloverfield connection.|Fresh
The film stumbles a bit in the end, when the exact nature of the perils within and without are made clear, but up until that point, 10 Cloverfield Lane is scarily suspenseful stuff.|Fresh
With or without the Cloverfield business, 10 Cloverfield Lane isn't a bad movie, merely a predictable and largely mediocre one.|Rotten
Superbly acted and brilliantly directed, this is a terrifically entertaining thriller that more than lives up to the hype.|Fresh
A film that pays more atention to the form than the actual plot, the structural space more than the story, and the mistery over the characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An interesting thriller where John Goodman stands out and a young director shows unusual talent for a film debut. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's claustrophobic, atmospheric, creepy to the extreme, and stays with you for a good while.|Fresh
This is a taut film that flips reality and tears up your expectations of where to think the film is going.|Fresh
After years spent quietly establishing himself as one of film and TV's go-to character actors, it's fantastic to see [Goodman] receive a big-screen role that truly capitalizes on his outsized talents.|Fresh
A smart and tense chamber piece that builds suspense carefully.|Fresh
Character-driven, tension-filled tale of psychological terror....|Fresh
The performances in this film are excellent. Director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job of maintaining the intensity of the suffocating suspense in this thriller. The screenplay sizzles with tension, and it rises to a whole new level at the end.|Fresh
Forget all about Cloverfield and just soak in the immense claustrophobia and paranoia that's so unrelenting you'll have to dig your nails out of the theater's armrests.|Fresh
Reminiscent of a Hitchcock film, this drama unfolds with a powerful intensity that will leave you guessing until its very end.|Fresh
Let's hope it's not another eight years before we pass this way again.|Fresh
I couldn't help but see the very visible thread line where the original film ended and the new ending was tacked on to make it a Cloverfield film.|Rotten
There are a lot of cinematic influences here from Hitchcock to War Of The Worlds but the original CLOVERFIELD surprisingly isn't really one of them in this pure anti-sequel that entertains while it surprises.|Fresh
I expected jump-in-my-seat scares. All I got was the fidgets and more laughs, most unintentional, than the last comedy I saw.|Rotten
The scary film caught my interest with its realistic developed characters and intelligent dialogue.|Fresh
Trachtenberg milks the simple 'What's outside?'/Twilight Zone premise for cascading cold-sweat thrills ... Goodman is perfect as the petulant, Cyclops-like captor ...|Fresh
...10 Cloverfield Lane will best be viewed for the amazingly acted, tense psychological thriller it is.|Fresh
Just when things seem to settle down as Howard, Michelle and Emmett relax with a quiet board game, the movie morphs into a nerve-jangling suspense yarn in seconds flat.|Fresh
The terrific performances by the three leads and director Dan Trachtenberg's effective staging are worthy enough to earn this a modest recommendation. Just don't expect many more surprises than one would reasonably find in any given episode of Scooby Doo.|Fresh
A tightly-wound, achingly-suspenseful, terrifically-acted thriller that keeps viewers on unsteady ground until the end credits start to roll.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is the jaw dropping and panic-inducing thriller 2016 never knew it needed yet wouldn't be as memorable without it.|Fresh
Make sure to bring someone with you who doesn't mind if you unexpectedly grab their arm. 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the best psychological thrillers to come along in awhile.|Fresh
Sharply made, with unease transforming into real horror. But once it becomes literal and more Abrams-esque, the thrill of discovery is abandoned.|Fresh
"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" certainly wins points for originality and, while its climax will garner its share of eye-rolls, I tip my hat for it at least trying to be a little bit different."|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane has little in common with Cloverfield but is, nevertheless, a clever, thrilling, and downright fun movie experience.|Fresh
A bit formulaic, but oh so scary. Then there's John Goodman!|Fresh
Everything about 10 Cloverfield Lane is wildly effective, except for the part that actually connects it to Cloverfield.|Fresh
It is best not to know where 10 Cloverfield Lane will take you. Revel in the competence of its craft and the playfulness of its performances. And revel in not knowing, for once.|Fresh
From the opening 'Psycho'-fueled moments to the allusions to 'Notorious' to the surprising twist of a finale, it's hard to recall a recent film that made squirming in one's seat such a pleasurable pastime.|Fresh
The movie address to find this weekend is 10 Cloverfield Lane. Delightfully entertaining and John Goodman's loose cannon is among his best ever performances.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is no masterpiece, but it achieves exactly what it set out to do with a bit of flair, a few real laughs and a couple of perfectly weighted scares. I walked out happy to have seen it. You probably will too.|Fresh
It's a conclusion that won't be to everyone's liking, but I can't fault a climax this weird when it produces a final shot as perfect as 10 Cloverfield Lane's -- though you'll have to go see the movie to find out what it is.|Fresh
The filmmakers keep the mystery going, indicating that the movie's not just another dashed-off attempt to cash in.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is a lot of fun, mostly because it's Michelle's story, and you're trying just as hard as she is to figure out the puzzle.|Fresh
It's a credit to director Trachtenberg, in a remarkably self-assured feature directing debut, that he lets the actors, including John Gallagher (The Newsroom), make a good script even better.|Fresh
It's a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too horror movie, where the sights and sounds crescendo to the very last beat.|Fresh
The horrors of that bunker far outweigh anything that could be waiting for them outside. Sometimes what is right in front of you is plenty terrifying enough.|Fresh
I put it to you that ending of 10 Cloverfield Lane sucks. Now let me explain why.|Rotten
10 Cloverfield Lane is rewardingly claustrophobic, keeping its focus tight on the characters and their cramped space while whatever disasters there are loom outside the bunker.|Fresh
The film is much more in the psychological thriller genre vein, so hardcore horror fans may be disappointed. But it barely diminishes the shine of the film, an excellent and confident addition to the genre.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is a fun and frightening blend of horror, suspense and science fiction that keeps twisting and turning right up to the final credits.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is creepy and campy all at once. It's a beautifully paced blend of sci-fi and horror, Armageddon flicks and Criminal Minds.|Fresh
Derivative, risible, paltry. Bring back M. Night Shyamalan, all is forgiven.|Rotten
10 Cloverfield Lane is an exciting thrill ride, and a terrific debut from director Dan Trachtenberg.|Fresh
A fun and tense film led by John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead and a great debut by director Dan Trachtenberg.|Fresh
It's unclear where the action is leading, and that's a large part of the movie's fun.|Fresh
I enjoyed the flick for a being a taut thriller that keeps you rooting for the protagonist and guessing -- until the end -- about what's really happening. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)|Fresh
The legacy of Syd Field's screenwriting manual hangs over 10 Cloverfield Lane, as it does all of Abrams's productions, which never even accidentally cast a whiff of subtext or authorial personality.|Rotten
A suspenseful and glorified Twilight Zone episode that provides plenty of thrills and twists to keep you squirming in your seat. John Goodman delivers one of the best performances of his career!|Fresh
And the Oscar for the Best Movie Nobody Saw Coming goes to ...|Fresh
As the address in the title suggests, monsters can come in all shapes and sizes, in all kinds of places, above us, below us and even right beside us.|Fresh
Goodman has given one of my favorite performances in years.|Fresh
...a refreshing alternative to normal overblown blockbuster offerings.|Fresh
Nope.|Rotten
10 Cloverfield Lane is a shining example of old-fashioned horror filmmaking, with nearly every scene building upon the last.|Fresh
It's a tense time in a confined space and director Dan Trachtenberg, taking his cue from Alfred Hitchcock (who would have loved the premise of this film), keeps tightening the screws until the final big reveal.|Fresh
A masterfully suspenseful thriller set in a doomsday bunker with some white-knuckle moments.|Fresh
First-time director Dan Trachtenberg wisely plays things close to his chest, slowly revealing character motivations and shocking plot turns as the movie effortlessly skips from one genre to the next.|Fresh
Go into 10 Cloverfield Lane mostly blind and let its mysteries unfold like a long-lost, newly discovered Twilight Zone episode. Because that's kinda what it is.|Fresh
Winstead is the glue that holds it all together, but it's Goodman who, as Howard, really runs the show.|Fresh
Chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane as 2016's first great surprise you never saw coming.|Fresh
"The cleverness of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is that it continually keeps the audience guessing, offering crumbs of hints, but never revealing its hand - at least for the first 95 of its 105-minute run time."|Fresh
Winstead also makes a terrific heroine; her character is a problem-solver, not a freaker-outer, and it's a stressful sort of fun watching her devise one plan after another to get around Howard's creepy patriarchal rules.|Fresh
Take away the disappointing, disjointed, and anti-climactic final act, and this is an effective white-knuckle psychological thriller.|Fresh
More Room than Doom, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a slow-burn thriller with different surprises in store than in 2008's Cloverfield.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is nothing that you'd expect, which ends up being its greatest and most alluring strength.|Fresh
It may not leave you screaming for a sequel, but it won't leave you screaming for your money back either.|Fresh
This is all you need to know: when that mystery box is finally opened, you'll be more than satisfied.|Fresh
It is designed to be fun, efficient and accessible and delivers precisely and exactly on that and nothing more.|Fresh
Winstead gives a strong performance as a captive who never gives up her fight. Goodman strikes a fine balance between nurturing caregiver and frightening captor, even if, to the detriment of the story, his end game is never really made clear.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane ultimately establishes itself as one of the most effective and downright creepy thrillers to come around in quite some time.|Fresh
Trachtenberg ratchets up the tension with ease, and even small things are filled with a stomach-turning dread that keeps the film chugging along until its explosive last act.|Fresh
This is a work of immense confidence, and the restraint Trachtenberg asks of his leads is remarkable -- Winstead and Goodman quietly excel in what could have easily been wild, loud caricatures.|Fresh
The more you know about it, the less fun it will be.|Fresh
It's a drama, it's a thriller, horror, sci-fi and mystery all in one.|Fresh
The title of 10 Cloverfield Lane is a bait-and-switch game, but for the best possible reasons -- because it so perfectly sets you up for one type of thriller that you won't be ready for the real terror as it unfolds.|Fresh
Goodman's very good, taking care of job one, which is to keep us guessing Howard's intentions. And Winstead is even better, within the parameters of this genre mashup.|Fresh
"Producer J.J. Abrams, a brilliant marketer, has to eventually open his ""mystery box,"" and the intelligence plummets. Never mind that. Go anyway and watch the arrival of the mighty Winstead, who'd do fine in a Room of her own."|Fresh
This movie is about its characters rather than its situation, and the actors are quick to fill the emotional space.|Fresh
the movie comes loaded with everything a psychological thriller needs to shatter your nerves - and then kicks it up a notch.|Fresh
If Sam Shepard ever goofed around with the alien horror genre, he might have come up with something like this surprisingly effective thriller.|Fresh
"Just serviceable bunker thriller that asks the question, ""Would you want to survive The Big One if it meant being stuck [underground] with the kind of guy who spent his life preparing to survive The Big One?"""|Rotten
Trachtenberg keeps the tension high, and even with the knowledge that something monstrous is likely lurking in the background, the movie remains unpredictable.|Fresh
Takes an instantly fraught premise and never stops stripping the screws. Within its narrow self-imposed parameters, it's just about perfect.|Fresh
A claustrophobic thriller with a whip-smart script that never tips its hand too soon.|Fresh
This serves as a good reminder that just because a movie can go in a certain direction doesn't necessarily mean it should.|Rotten
"It is, in more ways than one, a totally different creature from ""Cloverfield""; one that is frequently jarring, brilliantly controlled, and definitely worth going in blind."|Fresh
Trachtenberg and his screenwriters, Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken, take advantage of the shelter's tight quarters, which contribute to the expected pressure-cooker atmosphere of suspicion and hostility but also open up the punch-drunk comedy ...|Fresh
Trachtenberg impressively weaves together a delightful amalgamation of past influences, red herrings, and unrelenting tension.|Fresh
Above all 10 Cloverfield Lane is a showcase for Goodman, a consummate actor whose ability to terrify has rarely been exploited so thoroughly.|Fresh
From its Hitchcock opening to its eye-popping ending, Dan Trachtenberg's feature debut keeps us wondering about what's really going on, even as we root for Mary Elizabeth Winstead's spunky entrapped protagonist.|Fresh
A master class on narrative pacing and carefully managed jolts.|Fresh
A terrific, compact thriller.|Fresh
Goodman's performance, while unhinged, never veers into caricature. Similarly, Winstead avoids the cliche of the tank-top-wearing bimbo/victim, bringing an earthy self-reliance to her role.|Fresh
"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is as economical as a stage play but packs in plenty of visceral violence and visual surprises. Whether you've seen the first film or not, this one is a thoroughly entertaining treat."|Fresh
Approach 10 Cloverfield Lane on its own terms, let Dan Trachtenberg and his top-notch cast yank you into their world, and try not to sweat through your clothes.|Fresh
A chamber suspenser with real armrest-grabbing power.|Fresh
The fact that it's so drastically different from Cloverfield makes it a perfect sequel.|Fresh
a whole lot of nail-biting fun.|Fresh
A taut, claustrophobic exercise in tension with a distinctly 'Twilight Zone' vibe...that will keep you guessing.|Fresh
While the final 10 minutes of the movie aren't enough to drag down all the strong work that's been built up before, it's still a shame to see a movie try to fit into a box it was never designed to fill.|Fresh
Trachtenberg scares the wits out of us a few times, and then he launches into a climax that will have many talking -- though I found it somewhat disappointing, a little predictable, and frustratingly baffling. But you might love it.|Fresh
A thriller that winds you tighter and tighter before its secrets come tumbling out in a cathartic finale.|Fresh
A movie about fear that's not scary or surprising enough.|Rotten
"Rather than something truly wild and way, way off the wall, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a variation on the ""don't go down into the basement"" school of scary moviemaking, only this time with a 180-degree twist."|Rotten
The film zips between claustrophobic tension and nervous laughs with hoverfly agility.|Fresh
There's a fine, nerve-jangling little psychological thriller here. Pity it couldn't have been allowed to just be that.|Fresh
Unpredictability in cinema is frequently a missing element -- especially when we're talking about movies that fall into the horror or science-fiction genres. With 10 Cloverfield Lane, there is no such problem. Trust me.|Fresh
"Abrams has tried to produce a film that stands on its own yet ties into a universe that has yet to fully reveal itself. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" manages to do both - yet in retrospect, the first would have been enough."|Fresh
An overdone finale aside, there's much to enjoy and admire in 10 Cloverfield Lane, from its sharp performances to its economical, acutely realized sense of scale.|Fresh
While its story is smaller than the one told in the original Cloverfield, it is no less effective in its ability to unnerve and excite, and ultimately reminds us that humans can be much more frightening than sharp teeth and tentacles.|Fresh
At one point, this movie had me so on edge that I had a fleeting impulse to run out of the theater. It might be weird to say that and mean it as a compliment, but good thrillers work that way sometimes.|Fresh
"The best reveal of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is that the script from Josh Campbell, Matthew Steucken and Damien Chazelle (""Whiplash"") is strong enough to have made a compelling stageplay instead of a creature feature."|Fresh
Suffice to say that this is damn creepy stuff with fine work from Goodman, Winstead and Gallagher.|Fresh
First-time director Dan Trachtenberg finds just the right pace to keep us on our toes through all this.|Fresh
A sequel in third act only, 10 Cloverfield Lane successfully switches out monster-movie mayhem for chamber-room chills.|Fresh
Thumpingly exhilarating ...|Fresh
"Not an outright Cloverfield sequel but rather, as Abrams has put it, a ""spiritual successor."" It's also a better movie, one with a sense of humor about itself and its genre."|Fresh
Trachtenberg is patient building this world, and the actors do a good job inhabiting it.|Fresh
"I sure hope there's an ""11 Cloverfield Lane."""|Fresh
A well-crafted affair by debuting director Dan Trachtenberg that mixes elements of an intimate stage play with the white-knuckled tension of a cracking good Twilight Zone episode.|Fresh
This is rock-solid entertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing and jumping for 100 minutes before it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending.|Fresh
"Essentially the picture is one tease after another, misdirecting as fast as it can and amounting to the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" vacuousness of mid-period M. Night Shyamalan."|Rotten
Tamp down those expectations, then tamp them down some more.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is a taut psychological thriller with superb performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman. The measured reveal of the mysterious plot establishes a palpable tension throughout.|Fresh
All three actors are tremendous, and director Dan Trachtenberg, making his feature debut, must be commended for keeping things tightly focused.|Fresh
Opens like an indie romance, swerves into Saw territory, settles into light comedy, adds large helpings of horror and sci-fi, and wraps the entire thing up in mystery.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane is fun vacation into paranoia fallout; now you'll have to see it to find out why.|Fresh
It's a pity that such an unexpectedly effective thriller is so profoundly undone by a tonally disparate denouement.|Fresh
With its patchwork story, sewn together from disparate plotlines (perhaps collated from discarded script ideas), 10 Cloverfield Lane can be trying on our patience when it should be tightening the tension screws.|Rotten

One of the most entertaining genre movies I've seen since Cabin in the Woods.|Fresh

It's all very exhilarating and, at times, it's one of the scariest movies I've seen in a long time.|Fresh
10 Cloverfield Lane still feels like the spec script it spawned from, trying vainly to pack tense set pieces and striking moments of violence into its simplistic chamber play.|Rotten
Concise, suspenseful, yet still playful and smartly orchestrated.|Fresh
As a gamelike, simulationist PG-13 horror chamber piece, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a success: well shot and -staged, arrestingly acted, edited with a crisp unpredictability.|Fresh
A rollercoaster ride which will have you clinging to the edge of your seat from start to finish!|Fresh
A crackerjack exercise not just in genre but genres, with exacting direction, three great performances and a genuine respect for audience patience, intelligence and willingness to be go with a story that drags you hither and thither.|Fresh

A sensationally effective semi-sequel that bears virtually no narrative or stylistic resemblance to its predecessor ...|Fresh
Cloverfield was all about making viewers to gasp and pant; 10 Cloverfield Lane demands you hold your breath. As unnerving as it is surprising.|Fresh
