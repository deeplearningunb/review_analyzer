Mulligan, Gyllenhaal, and Oxenbould shine in Dano's fiery 1960s drama about a fracturing family.|Fresh
Carey Mulligan is giving a career best performance very reminiscent to Jessica Lange in Blue Sky and we all know how that turned out for THAT Oscar winner. The depths of emotional despair she exudes are dizzying, but spot on.|Fresh
The performances are smartly delivered, with Gyllenhaal at his most hang-dogged at times and Mulligan her beautiful but unsure self.|Fresh
Dano is 34, his partner and screenwriter Zoe Kazan is 35, and they have adapted a novel by Ford, who is 74. [ Mulligan] the tremulous center of it all, is 33. I cite the ages with certain wonderment at the seeming authenticity of Dano's work in every way.|Fresh

The emotions are sometimes raw, but there are no hysterics, no melodrama, and the performances are measured and honest.|Fresh

Ed Oxenbould starred in the kid movie Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. So it makes sense that he's now co-starring in what should be titled - - Paul Dano and his Terrible, (etc), Very Bad First Movie. Just kidding. Sort of.|Rotten
An impressive domestic drama illustrating emotional literary and the spiritual practice of impermanence.|Fresh
A small, poignant story that indicates Dano and Kazan may have a big future in movies.|Fresh
From the outset, Dano's direction is nicely understated. Joe realizes something is wrong between his parents, but he does not know what it is or why. He simply feels the tension in the household.|Fresh

Wildlife...feels like one of those films you expect to be brilliant only to realise halfway through that it's merely OK.|Fresh
Jeanette is a wonderfully puzzling creation: at times you applaud her spirit and liveliness, at others you wish she'd remember to protect her poor son from her wild excesses.|Fresh
Dano is not yet an Antonioni, but he has an eye for alienation which should serve him well in the future.|Fresh

"""Wildlife,"" is a perfectly measured drama boasting some powerhouse acting."|Fresh
"Dano pulls magnificent performances from his cast. That, along with beautiful cinematography and a patient-but-not-slow pace, makes ""Wildlife"" a magnificent debut."|Fresh
Dano is so attuned to his characters and their despair and vulnerabilities that even when they behave hatefully, as they do, or become revoltingly self-absorbed, as they do, you can't just wash your hands of them. You care.|Fresh
An intimate, low-key family affair that slowly gives way to a narrative where aggravation, pain and resentment simmer beneath the landscape ready to flare up.|Fresh
The standout performance may be that of young Ed Oxenbould. What are they putting in teenagers' cereal these days?|Fresh
Wildlife marks an accomplished directorial debut for actor Paul Dano who - along with writing partner Zoe Kazan - transforms Ford's 1960s-set tale of a fracturing family into a fantastic showcase for Carey Mulligan.|Fresh
At times thematically heavy-handed, but nevertheless atmospheric, the film's scaffolding is its three expansive central performances, and sensitive Stephen Shore-inspired cinematography.|Fresh

Paul Dano has crafted a poignant directorial debut exploring a certain cultural dissatisfaction by homing in on how it affects one family.|Fresh

It's a tale we've seen plenty of times before, told deliberately and tastefully, giving no glimmers of idiosyncrasy or, frankly, personality.|Rotten
Gyllenhaal and Mulligan are in fine form here, but too much of the screenplay, written by Dano and Zoe Kazan, doesn't ring true.|Rotten
She's a woman out of time, and Ford's story, written 30 years ago, set 60 years ago, is strikingly resonant.|Fresh
