One of the best comedies of its era, with a rich inventiveness of character and situation.|Fresh
Frank Capra's It Happened One Night was a film that defied expectations to such an outrageous extent that the cinema has never fully recovered from its impact or influence.|Fresh
Perhaps not the greatest of the screwball comedies, but Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the racier.|Fresh
Viewed even today with all of its plot elements recycled ad nauseam by Hollywood (for rom-coms, road trip comedies, odd couple/buddy films, etc.), the film still holds up because we believe Gable and Colbert and can identify with them both right away.|Fresh
It's nearly impossible to find anyone who doesn't love it. Or doesn't feel, in some way, that it speaks to them.|Fresh
It Happened One Night was in many ways a predecessor to the modern romantic comedy, and its dynamics will still feel familiar to the current-day viewer.|Fresh
Criterion expectedly gives Frank Capra's pre-code delight a thorough A/V buff and shine, along with excellent supplements that lends more context to Capra the artist than the film itself.|Fresh
It Happened One Night is one of the easiest movies to love and one of the hardest to think of as a work of art.|Fresh
It's funny, beautifully directed and acted and it's always been one of my favourites.|Fresh
As buoyant and elegant as bubbles in a glass of champagne, Frank Capra's sublime 1934 comedy... survives triumphantly because of its wit, charm, romantic idealism and its shrewd sketch of married life.|Fresh

Among the more gratifying phenomena of the current season has been the growing recognition of It Happened One Night, the Frank Capra production of last year, as one of the few potential classics of the recent cinema.|Fresh
A delightful free-wheeling comedy.|Fresh
Still one of the best screwball comedies.|Fresh
A screwball comedy with charm and sass it established a template that countless films have followed down the decades.|Fresh
It Happened One Night is pure delight.|Fresh
As classy and charming a romantic comedy as you're ever likely to see...|Fresh
Both stars loathed the experience yet turned in two of their most enduring performances.|Fresh
An old school classic.|Fresh
With Gable and Colbert on top form this is a charming and memorable comedy.|Fresh
One of those stories that without a particularly strong plot manages to come through in a big way, due to the acting, dialog, situations and direction.|Fresh
The story of a runaway heiress falling in with a devilish, wise-cracking reporter on a cross-country roadtrip now seems like a clich only because so many other films have copied its structure.|Fresh
This charming romantic comedy, while grounded in the context of the Depression, offered light fare that's uncharacteristic of Capra. It might have been the first true sleeper since no one involved anticipated such critical and commercial success.|Fresh
This is Capra at his best, very funny and very light, with a minimum of populist posturing.|Fresh
Only minorly dated, this film would play well for modern audiences despite being more than 70 years old.|Fresh
Capra's sense of humour is a little like that of Preston Sturges, though less caustic; and the film shows its stars at their best, Colbert as one of Hollywood's fresher comediennes, Gable as dumb-but-loveable hunk.|Fresh
Who can resist a movie where the girl's father provides his daughter with a getaway car from her own wedding?|Fresh
It Happened One Night is a true classic in every sense of the word, one that withstands the test of time and indeed defies it completely.|Fresh
The romantic comedy that all others draw from, few imitate effectively, and none have been able to replicate.|Fresh
|Fresh
A very funny and breezy comedy.|Fresh
|Fresh
Not only will the Walls of Jericho fall, but so will the walls of your heart.|Fresh
One of the most enduring romantic comedies of Hollywood's golden age… The opposites-attract comedy still works, though Gable’s dismissive treatment of pampered Colbert, which played well with Depression-era audiences, seems dated today.|Fresh
It Happened One Night is a good piece of fiction, which, with all its feverish stunts, is blessed with bright dialogue and a good quota of relatively restrained scenes.|Fresh
This classic comedy is the first movie ever to sweep the five major Oscar categories.|Fresh
Still as good as everyone says it is.|Fresh
It dates badly, but there's enough here to make it worthwhile|Fresh

...one of the smartest romantic comedies of the season. The Capra technique is evident in this story of a rich man's daughter who rebels at her father's objection to her marriage to an aviator.|Fresh
Uma prola de bom humor e otimismo.|Fresh
The grandparent of the screwball comedy sub-genre, and arguably Frank Capra's best film.|Fresh

The ultimate dizzy, romantic, screwball comedy.|Fresh
It happened one night in 1934, and it happens every time we watch this utterly beguiling film.|Fresh
Its opposites-attract melding of screwball comedy and the road trip elements has become one of about a half-dozen standard love story formulas. Most years, there's at least one theatrical release that owes a debt to this film.|Fresh
