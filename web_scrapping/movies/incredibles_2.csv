The characters dictate the plot rather than being instruments in never-ending action; the story grabs your attention, keeps its momentum.|Fresh
The movie is well-executed and clearly made with a lot of skill and care. Visually, Incredibles 2 is impressive and the action sequences are well-made...But it all seems very formulaic...|Fresh
I also appreciated how Incredibles 2 allowed the kids to be empowered without turning them into mini-adults like other franchises do.|Fresh
Hugely entertaining from start to finish.|Fresh
An incredibly fun, action-packed family adventure.|Fresh
To recapture the energy of that first amazing movie and update the narrative for a world in which superhero movies have become the backbone of the American cinema would seem to be an unattainable goal ... and yet they reach it.|Fresh
It's hard to recapture or exceed that magical feeling of seeing something new and unique as the first Incredibles presented itself to be. Incredibles 2 is such a worthy sequel that it certainly warrants another sequel to become a bigger franchise.|Fresh
The biggest struggle the sequel finds is that it really doesn't have anything new to say that wasn't present in the first film.|Rotten

Incredibles 2 is a hell of a fun time for the entire family, providing lots of superhero antics that rival films in the MCU and DCEU, loads more laughs than the original film and the cast and crew all back in the height of their game.|Fresh
The second part to the Incredibles saga has just as much emotion as the first but the action and performances have powered up.|Fresh
I'm very fond of the first Incredibles film, and by and large, its sequel is a welcome return.|Fresh
Uno de los escritos más sagrados del cine (el cual con el tiempo ha adquirido validez) indica que una secuela no puede superar a la original. Y aunque la vara estaba alta, Bird ni se acerca a lo que había logrado hace catorce años.|Fresh
The Incredibles are a family of unappealing, irritating, paper-thin characters. They're lame superheroes who don't really accomplish much.|Rotten
Incredibles 2 is a guaranteed good time at the movies, but anyone expecting the complexity of its predecessor might be left wanting.|Fresh
Bird's 1960s visuals and Michael Giacchino's jazzy score create the feel of a classic Bond, with all the dazzle you'd expect from a superhero blockbuster.|Fresh
The animation, while more detailed now, only advances in ways that seem a natural extension of what was striven for in the original.|Fresh
While I don't think it shines as brightly as the original, it still plays around with a lot of fun themes and tells a great story that features a family we've come to love dearly.|Fresh
Bird deserves a ton of credit for waiting until he had a story to tell before making this movie.|Fresh
As a sequel, Incredibles 2 is by far and away Pixar's best, it wraps together an intricate story with gorgeous artwork and fantastic acting to create something that manages to inspire the same magic as the first film.|Fresh
While Incredibles 2 isn't quite the instant classic the original was, it's a worthy follow-up, and proudly stands alongside any of the current crop of superhero movies.|Fresh
The family dynamic is still fantastic, the animation beautiful, and the writing whip-smart and funny.|Fresh
Pretty much everything about Incredibles 2 is superior to its predecessor, from the storyline to the character development, the humor to the heart.|Fresh
It's not quite the sequel we've waited for which we've waited with bated breath but The Incredibles 2 is another strong, well-crafted addition to the Pixar filmography.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 feels like visiting old friends.|Fresh
Just as the original Incredibles took a shot at nerd culture and the toxicity of fanboyism, The Incredibles 2 takes aim at escapist fantasies like superhero movies and society's dependence upon devices.|Fresh
The Incredibles 2 is a animated spectacle that edges out its predecessor in nearly every way; but most of all, in pure entertainment value.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 feels more like an expansion pack to the first film than a full-fledged sequel...That said, there's more than enough here to entertain as a summer blockbuster.|Fresh
The biggest overarching problem here is that there isn't really a singular story at play as much as a dozen or so half-formed sequel ideas that keep getting brought up, sort-of explored and then left to sit|Rotten
The Pixar sequel stands shoulder-to-shoulder with its predecessor with its impeccable blend of visual style, comedy, and family dynamics.|Fresh
While the Pixar emotional drainage is missing (as we've come to expect with almost every effort), the striking animation and constant chuckles will deliver a picture that is something to enjoy for the whole family.|Fresh
Certainly very entertaining, but it doesn't have the polish or style of its predecessor. Superheroes as sitcom.|Fresh
Holly Hunter gets to shine even more this time around. She's the heart and soul of the film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
While the overall experience feels too light, too pointless, too recycled, there's still a sense of excitement to be felt in the moment.|Fresh
Every bit as entertaining, enjoyable, and joyous as the original, proving a sequel can meet high expectations, and then some.|Fresh
The sequel we've all been waiting for.|Fresh
As good a sequel as fans could have reasonably hoped.|Fresh
The animation is really interesting this time around. For Frozone and Elastigirl, animators could really deliver high-quality action with impeccable detail.|Fresh
...the one (Pixar) film that, if not surpassing the breadth of its predecessor, at least comes closest to matching it.|Fresh
This sequel didn't disappoint. It's a great story, it's good to have them back, and it didn't feel like just a money grab.|Fresh
This is a fine time at the movies with a wonderful undercurrent of feminist thinking and some intelligent questioning of the role screens play in our lives.|Fresh
So while the endgame is familiar, Incredibles 2 finds a way to be unique in its execution of that template.|Fresh
This continues to be the 'fantastic four' that we deserve when we've been very good boys and girls.|Fresh
[Incredibles 2] is maybe not quite as deep as the original, but it certainly lived up to the original--I laughed a lot, it had a lot of really great action.|Fresh
Another huge triumph for Pixar. What an amazing job by Brad Bird.|Fresh
That the film manages to convey all that while being a rollicking memorable ride - action sequences with Elastigirl are awe-inspiring, while Jack-Jack steals every scene he's present in - is what makes it great.|Fresh
This is awesome.|Fresh
I feel like this surpassed the first one.|Fresh
Brad Bird's Incredibles 2, while a solid follow up, lacks a clear vision of where to take the story next.|Fresh
Writer/director Brad Bird delivers all the thrills and chills of the original picture, while still maintaining the heart that captured us the first go round.|Fresh
May lack that emotional Pixar punch, but because of the dazzling animation, thrilling action sequences, and the non-stop laughs, this long-awaited and most-anticipated sequel is serviceable enough to make fans of the original incredibly happy.|Fresh
What thrilled me the most ... watching these characters do the thing they were born to do [and] fully be themselves instead of repressing something fundamental about themselves.|Fresh
It's not often there can be this much time between a film and its sequel, and still deliver a picture that is near par with its predecessor.|Fresh
"Sometimes it comes closer to a superhero movie than a ""cartoon,"" and it ends up delivering the best of both worlds."|Fresh
Bird's screenplay mines every last drop of comedy from this role reversal set up, and then digs deeper to find some more.|Fresh
"""Incredibles 2"" is a step up from lackluster adventure, but it plays more like an above-average Pixar sequel than a worthy successor to one of the best superhero movies of all time."|Fresh
Amid a plethora of tired summertime movie sequels, Incredibles 2 stands out. Fourteen years in the making, Incredibles 2 is a superhero movie critiquing what it means to believe in superheroes.|Fresh
Bird injects enough sincerity and affection to forgive his clumsier attempts at making statements about governmental oversight, rampant consumerism and technological obsession, all obvious parallels with reality that don't easily cohere.|Fresh
It was lovely to spend more time with these characters and a great moviegoing experience, too, while it lasted. And yet... forgettable?|Fresh
An erratic (and ultimately disappointing) sequel...|Rotten
Incredibles 2 is big, action-packed and rich in plot, but it has a personal charm to it as well. The characters are reminiscent of real people, their fears, hopes and dreams true to life.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 isn't a new flavor, but it is the most refreshing of the summer. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
While the magic of the original film is dulled a bit with time, the new adventure still impresses.|Fresh
What a great family movie!|Fresh
All enjoyable, all perfect and, however, excessive in its perfection. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Spectacle at both technical and narrative levels. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Pixar's heroes are still the best, but they do not match their first film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The inventive choreography, animation detail, and stylish production design beg to be seen on the big screen. If the plot hadn't felt like a major recycling of the 2004 movie, it would surprise, but there's plenty outside the story mechanics to delight.|Fresh
You'll gawp. You'll ponder. You'll laugh. A Pixar flick would be nothing without the last.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 could be the future; a future in which every movie is polished but beige, beautiful but bland, fun but fawning, amusing but dull.|Rotten
A wonderful rejoinder to the DC and Marvel superhero movies, Incredibles 2 nails it.|Fresh
A family film that really will entertain the entire family and is a total delight, from the Underminer of the opening to the exquisitely styled credits at the end. Hugely recommended.|Fresh
Brad Bird not only directs with the same assured inventiveness he brought to The Incredibles (and Ratatouille, and The Iron Giant), but has written a script every bit as smart, witty and touching as the first.|Fresh
It may not be as polished as its predecessor, but Incredibles 2 is action-packed and joyful enough to please fans already connected to these characters.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 achieves its goal of entertaining and moving with certain passages in which we talk about the family union to get ahead in difficult times. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A true family movie that really does have something for all ages.|Fresh
A follow-up that may not surpass the achievements of its illustrious predecessor, but which still manages to deliver a classic in its own right. You'll have a blast.|Fresh
There's a serious movie lurking at the heart of all this hi-tech adventure that takes timely swipes at gender inequality, family stress and the modern triumph of salesmanship over substance.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is obviously incredibly fun, beautiful and well structured.|Fresh
A film which is as delightful as the original.|Fresh
Never underestimate Pixar's superpowers. In the end, gorgeous animation, great voice acting and a witty script save the day.|Fresh
The result is hugely entertaining and often visually audacious...yet it doesn't quite pack the emotional wallop of the original.|Fresh
This baby has a whole range of superpowers, one of which is stealing Incredibles 2 from the adult cast.|Fresh
More disappointing than the lack of inspiration here is the taint of corporate bias... A studio that has billions of dollars' worth of skin in the game of flogging sequels, merchandise and theme parks is in no position to issue moral instruction.|Rotten
A gorgeously curated scrapbook of sharply observed household comedy, sublimely staged action, a pinch of Chuck Jones-era slapstick, and enough modernist eye candy to induce a sugar coma in design buffs.|Fresh
The movie is funny, exuberant, inventive. It's even wise.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 will create its own ravenous consumers, as it will doubtless inspire the original's repeat viewing and cult status that made this sequel long awaited.|Fresh
How great to see them back in this funny, exciting, if less audacious film.|Fresh
Perhaps it falls a smidgen short of incredible second time around, but it's well nigh irresistible entertainment all the same.|Fresh
While not upper-echelon Pixar, the result is something of a magic trick: a bona fide for-all-ages romp.|Fresh
The visuals, voiceovers and music are all in perfect sync. Brad Bird creates an immersive, mesmerising world that you flow into unquestioningly instead of pausing to crib about the sundry plotholes and twists and turns.|Fresh
It was totally worth the 14-year wait and I'm so glad it's here now. Take some nerdlings. Go sans kids. Get a group of your grown friends together. Take yourself out on a date. Doesn't matter how you get there, just go!|Fresh
The Incredibles still holds its own as one of the best superhero properties in cinema|Fresh
Brad Bird's fleet-footed sequel reminds us that movies featuring god-like beings can challenge human-sized issues and not take themselves too seriously while doing so.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is the second best superhero movie of the year, after Black Panther.|Fresh
All of this is set to Michael Giacchino's fantastic score, which continues to wow with its jazzy, big band style. The music helps draw you into the world and personality of the film.|Fresh
The Incredibles 2, like the original, is a first-rate animated movie.|Fresh
The Incredibles 2 provides a joyfully sophisticated escapism and fantasy that both kids and adults will welcome right now.|Fresh
while Incredibles 2 is not nearly as good as the first film, there is a lot to enjoy here, starting with the still wonderful visual design|Fresh
Pixar's award-winning quality standards in terms of story and animation remain intact, and this is a very good quality sequel, with a very similar storyline to the first film.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 may not be superior to the original, but it was well worth the wait.|Fresh
Utterly infatuated with being a superhero movie, and because It's animated, it gets to be a way better one.|Fresh
Even if the mechanics of the plot sometimes bog down in expository dialog, Bird more than makes up for it with character-based humour.|Fresh
Bird has this ability to show us ourselves in a fun and sympathetic way. This is why his films, more than even other Pixar offerings, resonate so strongly with adults on an adult level, while still being enjoyable for kids.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 spins like a pop-art pinwheel because [Brad] Bird boasts a coherent and scintillating vision. He turns an action comedy about superhumans into a jamboree of human possibilities.|Fresh
Usually when watching a comic book... movie, I walk out of the theater desperate to live in their world. I would hate to run into The Incredibles in real life because I'd be certain they would be looking at me with judgement in their eyes...|Rotten
Brad Bird's smart decision to focus the story on Holly Hunter's Elastigirl makes it more in tune with the Time's Up era and the nascent powers of baby Jack-Jack steal the show.|Fresh
It's totally been worth the wait.|Fresh
This is the most bountiful visual feast seen yet in a year full of bountiful big-screen feasts. But once again, it's the character interaction that really makes this work. All superhero movies should be this thoughtful.|Fresh
While not quite matching the highs of its predecessor, Incredibles 2 is still an energetic ride of excitement, adventure, humour and heart, and one that establishes plenty of scope for progression should Pixar wish to continue the series.|Fresh
"Don't mistake ""Incredibles 2"" for another ""Montsters University,""and ""Finding Dory."" Bird, a true visionary, never settles without a risk and ""Incredibles 2,"" despite the flaws, and the predictable twist, is driven by Bird's wild imagination."|Fresh
The Incredibles is a story about family wrapped in a high-speed rollercoaster. Part Fantastic Four, part Fast and the Furious. We root for this family to overcome, succeed, and grow stronger together.|Fresh
... A spectacular piece of entertainment that should be mentioned ... in any conversation of the greatest superhero movies ever made.|Fresh
I walked out of the theatre feeling like I'd just watched the year's most exhilarating action movie.|Fresh
"""The comic-book nature of their social outlawry reduces Zack Snyder's profound issues of faith and the supernatural into the typical Marvel mess of jokey, anti-mythological ultra-cynicism."""|Rotten
Yes, it's very funny, but there's nothing about the concept that takes it much further. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Is not that the sequel of The Incredibles (Bird, 2004) is flawed, but as has happened with anothers sequels of Pixar, the extension of the story and the original characters fail to transcend.|Fresh
The franchise's canny ability to combine cartoon antics with cutting societal commentary ensures this is no mere rehash.|Fresh
Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter in particular are on top form, and the laughs are genuine and well-earned.|Fresh
Just as Elastigirl is stretched past recognition and restored to her proper definition, this is Brad Bird's demonstration of spectacular flexibility -- and a return to form.|Fresh
"But something in [Brad Bird] (or me) goes brain-dead when it comes to the ""Incredibles"" movies. They have no inner spark."|Rotten
It may not be groundbreaking but Pixar's latest Incredibles film... is a wonderfully lively, very witty affair.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a laugh-out-loud summer popcorn flick that speaks to all family members, offering timely messages of marriage equality and female empowerment.|Fresh
Despite not innovating in terms of the script, The Incredibles 2 is a worthy successor to the first that meets on the side of nostalgia and quality in animation. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Another visually-captivating, dizzying delight for young and old alike. Pixar and Disney have done it again!|Fresh
Sequels often feel inferior to the original but that's not the case here. Writer-director Brad Bird has returned to create a worthy, interesting story that befits the era we live in.|Fresh
Brad Bird's exhilarating sequel continues to investigate the theme of parenthood as a superheroic endeavor and expands the conversation to gender roles in modern families.|Fresh
The societal themes Bird is exploring are timelier than ever, and the movie's shiny, retro-futuristic look and Michael Giacchino's spy-movie score are as fresh as they were 14 years ago.|Fresh
A triumph of a sequel and a reminder of what superhero movies are capable of.|Fresh
The cannily appointed voice cast and silky, almost sculpted visuals ensure that this follow-up is still somewhat super.|Fresh
The movie doesn't force the role-reversal point, nor does it treat it as bewildering, although the creators will likely enjoy the benefit of viewers applauding them for writing powerful (animated) women.|Fresh
There's a lesson in there about apathy and idealism, valuable because it comes at a time when doing nothing doesn't seem like a valid option anymore. It's also a lowkey remake of Hancock.|Fresh
Right there with the first film in the series, and marks another triumph for director Brad Bird|Fresh
It's been 14 years since The Incredibles, and superhero movies are a lot thicker on the ground now, but writer-director Brad Bird has lost none of his wit and ingenuity; he can still show them how it's done.|Fresh
Adults will delight in the clever references, subtitles and nuances that Pixar regularly imbues in their films... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Despite the first Incredibles feeling newer and, ideas-wise, more focused in its tale of dreary domesticity rubbing up against wacky world-saving, this is terrific.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is well worth the wait... (another) super-smart breakdown of family dynamics that just so happens to be wearing a superhero costume.|Fresh
Brad Bird's vibrant, relentlessly paced sequel to his 2004 animation classic is not only a superior film, it ironically offers a refreshing, slick alternative to all the mega-sized superhero films that have invaded the multiplex.|Fresh
Beyond the shift in perspective there's little willingness to experiment, a reality at stark odds with the sheer creativity on display.|Fresh
Both films in the series combine farce with highly tuned stunts and a delicate way with characterisation once seen only in hand-drawn animation.|Fresh
Probably the most visually dazzling film Pixar has ever made.|Fresh
Stylized designs and outlandish powers aside, Bob, Helen and their progeny still feel oddly real.|Fresh
So much fun...the vibe of this movie completely connects with the last one, despite the fact they came out 14 years ago...there was a long wait, but it was worth it.|Fresh
This film was really epic and exhilarating, the villain was kind of weak, but it knew to focus on the heroes and flesh out their stories...and have a message that feels relevant.|Fresh
Incredible 2 breaks little new ground but does a good job of representing the dysfunctional family next door.|Fresh
Brad Bird believed in waiting for the right story to tell, and that decision certainly pays off in more ways than one.|Fresh
Brad Bird has made a film in the best traditions of Disney - great animation mixed with some real life issues and homilies.|Fresh
I would love to see a third [Incredibles]; I just hope it doesn't take another fourteen years to get made. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Let's be clear, in the visual aspect we are facing a filmic wonder. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
You don't often get a superhero film that talks about the necessity of female role models.|Fresh
The two films thus form a double-feature whose value goes far beyond the undeniable cinematographic quality they possess... The Incredibles 2 is simply one of the best superhero movies. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Incredibles 2 may not be as philosophically cohesive as it could be, but it is a fun, engaging film about letting others live their authentic lives.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a solid film, with enough elements to anchor itself the first... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What's been missing from Pixar's rightly vaunted stable in recent years has been a solid and exuberant adventure romp that's not going to make adults cry. Thank god for Incredibles 2.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a guaranteed good time at the movies. But like other Pixar sequels, it provides the entertainment value but eases the brakes on anything more substantial.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 was worth the wait, though. The movie takes everything that worked about the original and elevates it.|Fresh
There's some quibbles to be had in an over-familiar setup, and an under-served villain, but overall this is a gloriously fun family parable, and as entertaining as any superhero movie you'll see this year.|Fresh
"Bird's idea to give ""Incredibles 2"" a decidedly feminist bent by moving Elastigirl, aka Helen, to the fore seems creaky in the wake of last year's mega hit, ""Wonder Woman."" Still, I can't say I wasn't mildly entertained."|Fresh
both funny and poignant|Fresh
For some reason, we can't crawl through the cartoon door and into this universe the same way we used to. We've grown, either too jaded by experience or too overwhelmed by the images, to fit into this reduction.|Fresh
The action is plentiful. The gags are funny. Everybody is a day older. The real villain is exactly who you expect. And that's about it.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 hits all the right notes, with feminist themes, crazy visuals, and yeah, a little bit of exceptionalism.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 delivers timely messages about marriage equality, female empowerment, and technological oversaturation along with engrossing, colorful visuals.|Fresh
Using all of the digital advancements from the last 14 years, Brad Bird manages to make every action sequence in Incredibles thrilling without taking away from the familial element that made its predecessor revolutionary.|Fresh
"You have to be more incredible than this to compete in today's marketplace, but ""pretty OK"" will have to do for now."|Fresh
Bird thinks and films like an architect... and understands that real superheroes are born on paper and not on a computer pixel. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

Naturally, it's the chases and fight sequences that are the greatest joys of Incredibles 2.|Fresh

Smart, funny, energetic and a lot of fun, which means it's about as good as we can hope for from the studio that used to be Pixar.|Fresh
This is an entertaining, well-made movie that's a model of family entertainment. Writer-director Brad Bird, who made his Pixar debut with The Incredibles in 2004, has come up with a fresh take on his ground-breaking story of a superhero clan|Fresh
This sequel continues the story as nothing has changed in the past fourteen years. That is to the film's credit, and also its detriment.|Rotten
The antics of the baby & some of the Mr. Mom scenes make this a winner. But a 2-hour animated movie is about 20-minutes too long for younger kids & for some - me - adults.|Fresh

Incredibles 2 has something to say that's big and messy... It's not a perfect film, but it might be an important one..|Fresh
"Yes, it's a story with social resonance-the shifting roles of men and women, our growing technological overload-but it doesn't beat us over the head with ""messages."""|Fresh
A slickly-paced visual dynamo, the family superhero flick is a dynamic crowd-pleaser that gives superfans just about everything they could have bargained for.|Fresh
In other words, the film is about as iron-clad safe as it could have been, with many reprisals and echoes from the first film... It gives the audience what is most obvious to offer, but doesn't attempt to go any deeper.|Fresh
There's one way Incredibles 2 differs from its predecessor, and it may leave some gritting their teeth.|Fresh
There's a lot to love here, first and foremost Bob pulling Mr. Mom duties while Elastigirl is out saving the world.|Fresh
Big, annoying and mostly, pointless.|Rotten
Part of the problem is that in the years since the original we've been inundated with superhero movies. It's a film that feels like we've already seen it - several times.|Rotten
At a time when movie screens are clogged with indistinguishable superheroes, Incredibles 2 rises above the noise with its defiantly humane soul.|Fresh
'Incredibles 2' proves to be a credible follow-up, offering an assemblage of avenging superheroes who manage to entertain and exhilarate if never quite surprise.|Fresh
The concept of baby-proofing a house takes on a whole new meaning when it isn't the baby you're trying to protect, but the house.|Fresh

[T]heir super-heroics feel genuinely super.|Fresh
Once again, the action is fittingly spectacular, the music is great, and the whole thing looks fantastic.|Fresh

Incredibles 2 matters because Bird understands we as an audience are fond of Bob, Helen, Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack because they in turn love one another with selfless transparency.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a bright and bouncy addition to the lineup and a refreshing turn from recent dark and brooding superhero movies about men who miss their parents.|Fresh

It's a work of pure craftsmanship, designed to hold up to repeat viewings and making a grand companion piece to the first film.|Fresh
"Bursting with style and imagination, ""The Incredibles 2"" sets a standard that few superhero flicks - animated or live-action - can match."|Fresh
For all the nostalgia, this doesn't seem like a replay or a retread. It's particularly welcome, elating and thrilling, and it's less kid-pitched than recent Pixars: the older you are, the more you'll be pleased by what's going on.|Fresh
It satisfies on the most basic level - but you'll be left wondering why it didn't go any further.|Fresh
With the fabulous voice cast in top form and characters it's impossible not to love, this is certainly one of the best family-film outings released this - or any - year.|Fresh
...a cathartic riff on working parenthood in this multitasking millennium.|Fresh
Will equally appeal to kids and adults with plenty of material to appease both crowds. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
The material is entertaining even if it feels rather familiar - save for the Jack-Jack shenanigans.|Fresh
Even in the midst of its many boundless pleasures, Incredibles 2 charges us with a mission that's not for the faint of heart: to choose to look at one another instead of being fixated on the screens all around us.|Fresh
"Some [Pixar] sequels have felt needless (or awful: ""Cars 2""), while others have been most welcome. The 20th Pixar feature ""Incredibles 2"" is definitely in the latter camp."|Fresh
Imaginative, inventive and exciting, Brad Bird's sequel is fun family fare.|Fresh
But perhaps Incredibles 2's greatest achievement is that it manages to feel like a superhero movie with well-designed action sequences while also poking fun at the genre.|Fresh
The production mirrors what fans will remember from the original film, with stylish animation, bright colors, constant wit and an energetic vibe - plus return visits from familiar faces.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 isn't as good or affecting as the first, but it is prettier, louder, faster, and funnier-and if you have to make a trade, that's not a bad one.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 serves up that smart, funny, and eye-popping spectacle that viewers have come to expect from the animation studio whose particular brand of humanistic idealism under the guise of family entertainment has few equals.|Fresh
It's a joy to have them back, even if their second adventure isn't as enthralling or fresh as their first.|Fresh
Once again the animation is spectacular, but on a narrative level the picture treads an all-too-familiar path, not just in its action trajectory but in terms of present-day bromides about girl power and family dynamics.|Fresh
It cleverly inverts some of the original's storylines, builds on the central themes and provides an all-you-can-eat buffet of eye candy.|Fresh
In the end, the feeling you may take with you as you leave the theater, despite the forced good cheer of the finale and Michael Giacchino's airily mellifluous score, is one of disenchantment.|Rotten
The characters accomplish pretty much the same things that they accomplished in the first movie, just on a slightly larger scale, and the same goes for the filmmakers.|Fresh
Bird's script more than justifies this second adventure and more importantly manages to fully develop each character and entertain audiences of all ages. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bird keeps Incredibles 2 humming along at a great pace, alternating between some really fun and thrilling action sequences, a warm-hearted and relatable family story, and abundant laughs.|Fresh
A fun ride with lots of comedy including an impeccable spit take. The Parrs are in pretty much the same place at the end that they started.|Fresh
A suspenseful and thrilling adventure with plenty of laughs, wit and heart. Adults and children will be equally entertained. Don't be surprised if it gets nominated for Best Animated Feature later this year.|Fresh
Everything in Incredibles 2 is inexorably driven toward a big final blowout. That sequence is suitably grand and eye-popping, but haven't we seen all of this before?|Rotten
A fantastic sequel that hits all the right notes. Definitely worth the wait. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Like his superheroes, Mr. Bird is extraordinarily good at destruction, which is very much in evidence in the virtuosic, often delightful ""Incredibles 2,"" which picks up narratively where the last movie left off."|Fresh
Visual references and animated marvels abound.|Fresh
"I can almost guarantee that audiences will flock to see ""Incredibles 2"" and will not be disappointed. I definitively like it but there is just something missing."|Fresh
It's still a solid Pixar outing.|Fresh
"Incredibles 2 seems less exotic and, understandably, less ""new"" than the 2004 film. It's more Mr. Mom meets Wonder Woman. Yet it's as emotionally fulfilling and definitely a top 10 Pixar production."|Fresh
"Whatever the intention, ""Incredibles 2"" plays out as the worst of both worlds, a combination of the typical weaknesses of both animated and live-action superhero films, with few of the strengths."|Rotten
While it takes time to build up steam and set up its plot mechanics, once everyone is in costume and letting loose, it's an exhilarating ride.|Fresh
Boosted by Michael Giacchino's rousing jazzy score, Incredibles 2 is non-stop fun.|Fresh
"It is the rare animated feature, and the rarer superhero movie, that will leave the audience thinking, ""That was a lot of fun, but I wish there was more of the raccoon."""|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a solid outing from Pixar, but after fourteen years of waiting, it should more than live up to its title.|Rotten
It's a solid double and that's just fine, but I'll admit to a feeling of mild disappointment it wasn't a grand slam, given the greatness of the first adventure and the grand and creative mind of Mr. Bird.|Fresh
The Incredibles 2 makes its mark as a thrilling family adventure that can go pound-for-pound with any superhero movie, live action or otherwise.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 may be engaging, smart and witty, but to say it's as impressive as the original? That's a stretch.|Fresh
It's good, fun family entertainment but it's not incredible.|Fresh
Pixar here does a perfect job of juggling story, thrills and laughs in a way that keeps you majorly engaged and entertained for two straight hours.|Fresh
A sparkling contraption of an animated comedy, funny and often wondrous in its midcentury-modern vision of an alternate America frozen in the amber of a bygone idealism.|Fresh
Infinity War is Screenslaver, advocating the hypnotic allure of empty spectacle. Incredibles 2 is the Winston Deavor character, believing in the power of branding but also the value of inspirational narratives.|Fresh
INCREDIBLES 2 is wildly entertaining and a lot of laughs!|Fresh
INCREDIBLES 2 never wears out its welcome. The movie features nearly non-stop laugh-out-loud humor.|Fresh
"The most politically potent Pixar picture since ""Wall-E."""|Fresh
Disney and Pixar do not disappoint after a fourteen year Incredibles absence. Incredibles 2 is top notch family entertainment.|Fresh
Bird first and foremost aims for a rousing, funny and touching entertainment, and delivers the goods.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a delight! The family dynamic is brilliant yet again, with Jack Jack being a major scene stealer. There's also more A+ work from composer Michael Giacchino.|Fresh
But the core of the movie is the family dynamic, so the somewhat lackluster antagonist does little to detract from that.|Fresh
"For all the slick panache Bird and his team of animators have brought to the style of ""Incredibles 2,"" they've built in the most important element of all - actual danger, which creates actual emotional investment"|Fresh
This one still delights. But its satire on superheroes no longer seems quite so, well, incredible.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 certainly delivers the action for those who crave it, but its charm comes from the characters Bird has created and the actors who voice them.|Fresh
This follow-up is every bit the start-to-finish sensation as the original, and Brad Bird's subversive spirit is alive and thriving. Like its Oscar-winning predecessor, The Incredibles 2 doesn't ring cartoonish. It rings true.|Fresh
Bird doesn't bring the tears like many Pixar films do... but he tests the Parrs' bonds repeatedly, as they take on bad guys and the struggles of parenting, and do a super job at both.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a movie that could have been made redundant by time. Instead, it lightens the mood in a world gone super-serious.|Fresh
As glad as I was to spend time with the Parrs in 2018, on the second go around, they are ultimately demoted to simply 'credible'.|Fresh
It's as accurate and nuanced a portrait of parenthood and childhood that one's apt to see in a mainstream blockbuster.|Fresh
"""Incredibles 2"" doesn't surpass the 2004 effort, but there's no reason it has to, with Bird returning to this world with care."|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a reminder of what a collective joy it can be when a filmmaker with a singular vision and purpose makes a film of boundless scope and budget.|Fresh
"I'm holding out hope for an ""Incredibles 3"" where Violet and Elastigirl team up against a baddie who goes by The Patriarchy."|Fresh
A deliciously detailed, multilayered, multi-textured, multigenerational tale brimming with espionage satire, cinema savvy and pop-culture wit.|Fresh
Bird seizes on a key insight: healthy families can reconstitute themselves and come out better for it. Healthy sequels can, too.|Fresh
...while briskly and breezily enjoyable, The Incredibles 2 lacks the poppy freshness of its predecessor.|Fresh
I chuckled and giggled throughout this delighful film, whose smart script relies on character and whose joie de vivre shines through every Incredibles moment.|Fresh
... touches on exceptionalism but detours into a clever critique on a society reliant upon rescuers... worth our wait, even it feels a bit overstuffed. After fifteen years: still incredible.|Fresh
Prior to this, Brad Bird made what can unequivocally be called two of Pixar's best movies. Now that statement can be updated to say that he's made three of Pixar's best.|Fresh
It is indeed impressive that in this day of superhero movie galore, Bird still brings a great sense of wonder, visual aplomb and cut-with-a-knife tension to scenes of action-adventure that pop with style and bristle with vitality.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 feels a bit late to the game, but will still delight audiences in the themes and family togetherness it promotes.|Fresh
While children and adults will both be entertained alike, there is a great humanist message in the film that never veers too far into an aggressively blunt political allegory, but one that simply draws thoughtful parallels to current events|Fresh
It seems so weird to say: While writer-director Brad Bird's Incredibles 2 is undeniably a good time at the movies for the whole family, it's the rare superhero movie that may have too many ideas knocking around in its noggin.|Fresh
Plays it safe...another issue of the Incredibles comic book, another big-scale adventure with full-throttle action sequences, a bit of mystery, and career complications testing the structural integrity of this nuclear family of superheroes.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 captures most of the fun of Pixar's The Incredibles, but feels somewhat outdated in the modern Hollywood landscape of superhero movies.|Rotten
...The Incredibles 2 may just be the best Pixar sequel ever.|Fresh
It's good - funny, smart and contemporary. By definition it can't be as groundbreaking as the first film, but never does it feel like a cash grab.|Fresh
"In a narrative about how to handle your work/life balance to the benefit of both spouses as well as the betterment of your children, ""Incredibles 2"" seems content to punch the clock and do its job reasonably well."|Fresh
It's as bright and visually inventive as its predecessor, and finds cheeky new outlets for Bird's unbridled cinematic sensibilities.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is just as wonderful, gorgeous, and thrilling as the first, to the point where most super fans of the original likely won't care about these flaws.|Fresh
Young girls will be inspired by seeing so much focus on a female superhero with Mrs. Incredible in the spotlight.|Fresh
A sequel that works much better when it's exploring the filmmaker's ideas dramatically than when it's serving as a soapbox for cranky opinions about technology, parenting, and gender roles.|Fresh
I think this is a movie you rush out to see right away. I couldn't believe how much I liked it.|Fresh
"""Incredibles 2"" is not only one of Pixar's best movies ever, but also arguably one of the greatest superhero movies ever made."|Fresh
Pixar films are famously beautiful when it comes to character design and art direction, but Incredibles 2 is one of the most significant achievements in this regard.|Fresh
Amidst a Hollywood landscape cluttered with superhero movies, Incredibles 2's greatest power may be its ability to re-establish its own witty, whiz-bang niche.|Fresh
It's an easygoing and sometimes overly familiar slouch toward retro superheroics, yet unlike Pixar's last several bland sequels, and almost the entire whole of the superhero genre these days, Incredibles 2 has something to say.|Fresh
Perhaps most intriguingly, Incredibles 2 is both pop-culture eye candy and a sly critique of it.|Fresh
Brad Bird's The Incredibles 2 is, much like its predecessor, delightful as an animated feature but really, really delightful as a superhero picture.|Fresh
It's like the best of the Avenger-on-Avenger bits from Captain America: Civil War or Avengers: Infinity War - only better, because it's easier to follow the the crisp, colorful action.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is a movie that lavishes attention on the details but loses sight of the whole, where you can't see the forest for the meticulously rendered trees.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is kind of like Jack-Jack; relatively small, extremely smart, bursting with potential, and capable of mutating into a new form in a matter of seconds.|Fresh
What was organic, and even obsessive, in the first outing comes off as pat and elaborate formula here.|Rotten
"Though it would be unrealistic to expect ""Incredibles 2"" to have quite the genre-busting surprise of the original, it is as good as it can be without that shock of the new - delivering comedy, adventure and all too human moments with a generous hand."|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is much more self aware, and artfully dodges a lot of the tired tropes associated with husband-wife role-swaps.|Fresh
The animation is stellar and detailed in excellent action sequences, Michael Giacchino's score swings harder than ever, and the first film's family-friendly warmth is just as appealing now as it was then.|Fresh
It's still fun to watch smart storytellers like [Brad] Bird working within the system and using his platform to self-evaluate or comment on what's going on, even if the conclusion is a little flimsy.|Fresh
Their adventures are timeless. And this one is worth the incredibly long wait.|Fresh
A similarly rousing and savvy adventure that energetically serves up more of what we love and yet wisely, wittily, reverses the first film's accommodating traditionalism to make for an even richer, funnier portrait of its tight and in-tights family.|Fresh
It is a funny, thoughtful, and thrilling adventure that artistically justifies itself without invalidating what came before.|Fresh
While Incredibles 2 rarely treads new stylistic or thematic ground, what it lacks in cohesion or originality it makes up for with a remorseless willingness to entertain.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 remains fresh and fun, but also distinct from its predecessor.|Fresh
It feels like a direct extension of the first film. It feels like a movie that could have easily come out in 2006 as opposed to now, which is what makes Incredibles 2 so fun.|Fresh
It's not just a great superhero movie, it's a great sequel, and a great Pixar movie too. Incredibles 2 is an absolute delight that was worth the long wait.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 certainly proves worth the wait, even if it hits the target but not the bull's eye in quite the way the first one did.|Fresh
Of course, Incredibles 2, for all of its domesticity, is never dull.|Fresh
Don't let the dazzle fool you. Bird's made the weirdest Pixar movie ever, revolutionary and retro, an anti-authoritarian ode to good parenting.|Fresh
While Incredibles 2 doesn't reach the same heights as the 2004 original, it's more intelligent than other recent sequels.|Fresh
Brad Bird's strong script and direction elevate this animated adventure to new heights.|Fresh
Incredibles 2 is that kind of full-bodied picture, engaging and inventive and rendered with muscle.|Fresh
"A giant family entertainment with deeper, more universal themes at work and a sophistication in its storytelling. ""Incredibles 2"" is another winner for Pixar, seemingly effortless in its savvy and confidence, excitement and heart."|Fresh
It's not only the best animated film of the year, it's one of the best films of the year, period. And it's a blast.|Fresh
Pixar, ever able to roll with the punches and make movies that are timely yet timeless, has punched through the glut of comic book movies.|Fresh
Here's hoping they're back again soon; I can't wait to meet Jack-Jack's unlucky preschool teacher.|Fresh
