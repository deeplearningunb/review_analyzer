Guadanigno is not interested in creating a story about sin, but rather one about joy, goodbyes and the loss that involves love. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name is a masterfully told story about first love, hidden sexual desire and coming-of-age experiences capped with great performances, immersive production values and nuanced direction that will surely dazzle the eyes and warm your heart.|Fresh
Guadagnino creates a perfectly judged atmosphere of melancholy, longing, tranquillity and inner turmoil as the heat of the summer engulfs Elio with a rising attraction to Oliver.|Fresh

CALL ME BY YOUR NAME REVIEW: 'A STUNNING COMING-OF-AGE TALE THAT WILL GO DOWN IN GAY CINEMA HISTORY|Fresh
By the end of the film, when Michael Stuhlbarg delivers what is surely one of modern cinema's most achingly beautiful monologues, I was a puddle.|Fresh
Guadagnino delivers one of the year's most striking, eloquent films... Each moment feels pulled out of a different era, transporting viewers in a way only cinema masters can.|Fresh
Gorgeous to look at but with a barebones plot that struggles to keep things chipping along and some questionable statutory dilemmas, I found myself hovering on the edge of attention when I should have been diving in head first.|Rotten
Call Me By Your Name has been marketed as a gay romance, yet less overt is its inclusion of Jewish culture.|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name is an unapologetic celebration of emotion.|Fresh
An observational character piece that's meant to be experienced in terms of visual beauty, erotic charge and thoughtful contemplation on the intensity and brevity of youth and love.|Fresh
It's a very astute study of the struggles of a young man trying to find out who he is and struggling between relationships -- both conventional and forbidden by society.|Fresh
Here is a film that shuns conventions expected in coming-of-age stories and romances but never at the expense of universal emotions felt by anyone who has ever been in love.|Fresh
It's refreshing, wonderful, and shows that love is love no matter how you slice it.|Fresh
Guadagnino's adaptation of André Aciman's novel is a wonderfully sensitive and evocative portrait of young love, but lost in time somewhere in Northern Italy, Call Me By Your Name gets caught up in the outdated politics of its day.|Fresh
It's hard for me to talk about this film without just hurling adjectives at the page; it's tender, beautiful, sexy, hilarious and deeply moving - a romance story for the ages, directed and acted with a passionate sincerity.|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name is a staggeringly beautiful film that brings together a fully fleshed out artistic vision ... as well as a host of brilliant performances from its cast.|Fresh
It's a languid Italian summer circa 1983 and everything is just so ripe.|Fresh
"Where so many Hollywood ""gay"" stories end on positive notes of rebirth and optimism, Guadagnino helms a love story unafraid to highlight the suffering one always contains."|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name survives because of poignant screenwriting, keen directing, and tender acting.|Fresh
"Right when I begin to feel fatigued by ""coming of age"" movies, this comes out and blows me away."|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name doesn't insist on your attention for much of its two-hour running length; it lets you fall in and out, its scenes glazed with a nostalgia that almost encourages personal reminisces.|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name is a romantic masterpiece and, quite possibly, my favourite film of the year.|Fresh
In one singular space, you feel insecure, confident, charismatic, inferior and completely clueless, as if it were a revolving door never allowing you to stop and walk through, towards something bigger, maybe even something grown up.|Fresh
"A compelling, confusing, beautiful film peopled with unforgettable, believable characters, not necessarily a crowd pleaser, but an intense, highly individual vision that might open your eyes to what the definition of ""summer romance"" can mean."|Fresh
"By opting against a graphic depiction of the characters' carnal consummation, it causes that spark of first love Elio is coming to terms with to linger more pervasively. That warmth exuding from the screen is ""Call Me by Your Name's"" gift to you."|Fresh
I find it strangely hypocritical that Hollywood is so willing to celebrate the behavior on film that it so vehemently condemns in real life... Call Me By Your Name is creepy, not cool.|Rotten
It works well as a coming of age story and examination of how people communicate when they are unsure of the other's feelings.|Fresh
Chalamet's performance ascends into the pantheon of greats, a mixture of Marlon Brando's brimming panic and Heath Ledger's simmering vulnerability.|Fresh
Call Me by Your Name is a stronger film than the director's last film, A Bigger Splash, and employs touches of pure emotion that will tug at your heart.|Fresh
Oliver being a whole person instead of a dreamboat would have elevated this movie to the first rank. But go see this movie, bask in the sunshine and feel your heart growing three sizes larger.|Fresh
There is much to relish in this passionate, visually rich romance...that particularly excels in its refreshing take on the permissiveness that's possible through liberalism guided by knowledge and experience.|Fresh
The era of LGBT cinema has reached a zenith with this film.|Fresh
Surprisingly, given how hyper-articulate everyone is, the duo's most potent scenes are wordless, conveying a wealth of emotion in glances and gestures.|Fresh
In a technical sense, Guadagnino understands how to transition between these moments, allowing the film to breathe effortlessly into the next as scenes are woven together with cross dissolves and fades rather than harsh cuts.|Fresh
It is the transmission of halcyon and the ensuing tragedy of its evaporation that Guadagnino nails in his adaptation.|Fresh
Call Me by Your Name's strength is that it really does seem like the character played by Timothée Chalamet made the film himself.|Rotten
The chemistry between the leading men grows organically and it chronologically makes sense for the viewer. These characters take time to feel comfortable with each other and the film takes its time documenting it.|Fresh
The characters' beauty and intellectual perfection is so consummate that I couldn't entirely believe that these people actually had genitals-that they could ever sweat or incur sunburn.|Rotten
...a fascinating study of fleeting love, proving that a lot can be done when you favor characterisation and atmosphere over traditional narrative. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director Luca Guadagnino has infused Call Me by Your Name with an unhurried and excessively languid sensibility that becomes more and more problematic as time progresses...|Rotten

A fine coming-of-age ode to first love.|Fresh
It ends up being quite moving, supported by excellent performances to create an effective drama. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name is a film made with great care. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Call Me by Your Name sees Italian filmmaker Luca Guadagnino do his home country proud with an absolutely gorgeous depiction of the northern Italian countryside.|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name does more harm than good, and needed to be and do more. Especially as yet another queer white cisgender-centric film, it should have aimed for the stars instead of aiming to make people feel comfortable.|Rotten
... [director Luca Guadagnino] seems to give body and soul to Call Me by Your Name. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The layered, lovely script is rich with an understanding of life and loss that comes only with age.|Fresh
I appreciated the film quality and the acting but the story meandered in superficial courtship for too long without delivering actual connection. It was all foreplay and no action. Perhaps the sequel will make this film more appealing to me in the future.|Rotten
Destined, almost certainly, to become a queer film classic. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
...many of the best moments illustrate the experiences of [Timothy Chlamaet] in the solitary privacy of his room. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A sweet and loving film where the characters are less mindful of an outside response and more consumed by the amorous temptations they possess.|Fresh
Anyone who has experienced the flush of first love will relate, but the fact that the film is specific and detailed both emotionally and physically in its portrayal of a gay relationship makes it a standout.|Fresh
A song to life. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is not only lovely to look at (the exquisite northern Italian countryside made me want to hop on a plane that moment), but is made even better by the subtle performance of Timothée Chalamet.|Fresh
It is a brilliant, moving and charming film that delves into self-discovery and is perfect for this century. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a beautiful film -- one that is startlingly real. It feels so blisteringly sensual and in the moment, that it's almost impossible to ignore.|Fresh
The drama is filled with raw emotions and evinces an incredible honesty in terms of storytelling. The filmmaking style reflects, even more, the vivid three-dimensionality of the characters.|Fresh
There's no way to convey why I dislike the film so much without giving out major spoilers later in this review, so be warned if you're really dying to see this 132-minute, morally bankrupt snoozefest.|Rotten
This Best Picture nominee is a beautifully filmed coming-of-age and coming-out story.|Fresh
The result is enveloping and moving. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...it breathes and evokes the essence of a landscape that throughout the centuries has been sometimes Italian and sometimes Gallic, but always Mediterranean to the marrow: a fertile ground for love or desire. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Call Me By Your Name"" can be considered an idealistic film, but that's only natural for something about young people experiencing something wonderful for the first time."|Fresh
Some of the scenery in the film, including a waterfall, is spectacular. The location shots are sumptuous. The acting is subtle and moving. This film has a lot going for it, but it is also very low-key, relatively non-dramatic and slow-moving.|Fresh
It's an extraordinary thing for a narrative film to successfully observe its characters like they aren't of its own creation - to make them utterly alive in front of us.|Fresh
This seminal offering in the gay drama genre features remarkable performances by Michael Stuhlbarg, Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet, who also plays the love interest in Lady Bird.|Fresh
"A beautifully told story about discovering love, ""Call Me by Your Name"" is buoyed by the performance of its two lead actors."|Fresh
Call Me By Your Name is one of the best films of 2017. That is indisputable. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Nothing happens and everything happens, the story's growing emotional power coming from subtle, complicated lead performances, exquisite pacing and dreamy, melancholy music from Sufjan Stevens.|Fresh
As pretty as a vacation postcard, and the actors deliver terrific performances that keep you engaged with their characters. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Most importantly, Call Me By Your Name is an honest story of hearts on fire, broken, and then healed, with wise affection for its characters and their struggles, and a message of tolerance and love for us all.|Fresh
Overall, Call Me by Your Name is a charming film, a sexy film and a family story. Though it drags in a couple of spots, it recovers nicely. What else could you want?|Fresh
Films as special as this one are not often seen. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A very sensual story about how love and erotic passion can consume a person, particularly a budding teenager whose hormones encourage him (or her) to basically lust after anything in sight. Even a peach. Especially a peach.|Fresh
[The film] is able to move emotionally, from the rage of an idle summer to the icy winter...From the rhythm of an eighties song, to the soft, sharp and hurtful melody of Sufjan Stevens. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Call it what you want but this movie is an instantly fond memory.|Fresh
"I long to be as free as Hammer is in the scene in which Oliver dances, wildly and gracelessly, to The Psychedelic Furs' ""Love My Way."""|Fresh
"It's no Brokeback Mountain. There's no social, cultural, parental or ""public"" issue. It's about coming of age, not coming out. The guiltless, ephemeral exhilaration. It's an unforgettable, virtuoso achievement by Mr. Guadagnino."|Fresh
But the timeless torture of trying to decipher if his feelings are reciprocated, what to do about it if they are, and how each of them should feel about it, is rendered with poignant delicacy.|Fresh
Anyone who has had -- or has imagined -- a doomed youthful fling might be susceptible to this charming, bittersweet film.|Fresh
Michael Stuhlbarg gives a strong supporting performance as Elio's compassionate father and Hammer is very well-cast, but Chalamet owns the film with his passionate ambiguity.|Fresh
Call Me by Your Name is a movie about two people falling in love. It's the kind of movie that's deceptively simple, but one that lingers. In other words, it's the best kind of movie.|Fresh
You purchase the ticket for the sensual slow-burn love story that develops between Elio and Oliver, captured against the gorgeous backdrop of Northern Italy, but you might find yourself moved to tears by the genuine appeal Stuhlbarg makes to his son.|Fresh
... seductive, finely wrought, and gently knowing film...|Fresh
It's a sensual celebration of young love and lust.|Fresh
What could be dismissed as experimentation is instead framed with care and kindness as a first love, woozy and meaningful, bringing this fantasy world somewhere universal.|Fresh
There is an air of the impossibly dreamy about the slowly unfolding events - and how the camera adores each man - but beneath its sublime scenery and beautiful people are the recognizable truths of too-real relationships.|Fresh
'Call Me by Your Name' warmly and objectively captures the exhilaration and heartbreak of first love. It floats by like a cloud and softly embraces you like a tender hug.|Fresh
It is pleasant enough, as a character study of Elio, but it doesn't offer much in terms of dramatic payoff.|Fresh
The film's last-minute twist is strictly spoiler territory, so all I'll say is that Call Me by Your Name is that rare achievement: a great film that only gets greater as it unfolds.|Fresh
The subtle build of anticipation makes the coming of age romance Call Me By Your Name so irresistibly delicious.|Fresh
Watching Luca Guadagnino's sumptuous 1983-set romance feels like you're living inside someone else's cherished memory, hazy but still vivid.|Fresh
The film wonderfully captures the intensity of that first love -carnal, fleeting and unforgettable - that leaves an indelible mark on everyone lucky enough to experience it. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
I defy anyone to find a story of first love -- its triumphs and heartbreaks, its feverish beginnings and its sad endings -- that's as passionate or as moving as the one told in Call Me by Your Name.|Fresh
The most romantic and sexiest film of 2017. A superb love story all across the board. Stays with you long after. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
You can feel the stillness and the heat of this sultry, sensual summer in Italy. This is a glorious romance about falling in love with life itself, and living with gusto.|Fresh
...it's like sitting through your oversharing neighbor's two-hour vacation slideshow.|Rotten
Desire and the flush of first love permeate this haunting film, whose Italian countryside setting echoes the beauty of the sentiments portrayed.|Fresh
"An overlong gay coming-of-age tease, ""Stealing Beauty,"" without Liv Tyler, ""American Pie"" with less...baking."|Rotten
Ravishingly pleasurable to look at purely as visual abstraction, even before we get in the business of the erotic depictions.|Fresh
Recalls the talky, intellectual, but swoony summer romances of Eric Rohmer.|Fresh
A lovely film that works on various levels, not least being its insistence on lush visual cues.|Fresh
It is an adaptation that is loving and faithful, but not slavishly so.|Fresh
There's just so much to discover in director Luca Guadagnino's take on a 2007 novel of the same name: Some beautiful Italian images, a few simply smart exchanges, and an '80s love story pertinent to our times, to name just a few.|Fresh
If there is a film that could be described as luscious, this is it.|Fresh
... captured by the sensual camera of Sayombu Mukdeeprom: a kind of pastoral Arcadia in which all the senses reign. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The skill of Guadagnino's film is the time it takes to tease out Elio and Oliver's attraction, and to deepen our investment in how it plays out.|Fresh
Guadagnino creates an evocative understanding of time and place, generating a sincere picture, and one that taps into the blur of primal longing.|Fresh
Could this film be any better? The cinematography beguiles. The dialogue is natural yet artful. The cast is first rate in every way|Fresh
This is not simply a story of an introvert and an extrovert finding love with one another, but a portrait of desire, told with Guadagnino's unique and detailed attention to place.|Fresh
Beautifying shot, hauntingly scored and terrifically acted, Call Me By Your Name is a film whose imagery (particularly its final shot) and characters will stay with you for days.|Fresh
The biggest achievement of Call Me by Your Name is that it manages to depict something universal about first love and first loss...|Fresh
Based on the acclaimed 2007 novel by Andre Aciman, Call Me By Your Name builds slowly, but surely into a truly great work of purely emotive cinema.|Fresh
The most sensual film in ages; a transcendent exploration of first lust, first love, and first heartbreak seen through the eyes of a hormonal teenager.|Fresh
Elio might have come across as a bit of a prat were it not for his flickering, on-the-edge-of-adulthood beauty, which helps to mitigate some of his... actions. His emotional vulnerability in the face of his desire makes him universally accessible.|Fresh
One of the great coming-of-age movies, and also one of the great movies of teasing courtship|Fresh
Too long at 132 minutes, Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name still has much that impresses, from the beautiful, sometimes sun-struck cinematography to the occasionally cutting humour to Timothée's spot-on portrayal of surly teenage awkwardness.|Fresh
What truly elevates Call Me by Your Name is Michael Stuhlbarg, as the father to Chalamet and the teacher to Hammer, who gets an all-timer monologue that provides extra layers to the story.|Fresh
"The spirit of Eric Rohmer lives vibrantly in the luscious-looking ""Call Me by Your Name."" But, unfortunately, not his talent."|Fresh
Enthralling and unforgettable. Yet, reenforces society's belief that the penis is ugly. Could physically gifted Armie Hammer has an ugly penis?|Fresh
This is, in the end, a simple and beautiful love story-a 'Brief Encounter' that happens to be gay, told with humanity and heart-wrenching truth. It is also, of course, one of the year's very best films.|Fresh
The film luxuriates in the sun-kissed settings, languorous and largely devoid of conflict. It's an awfully nice movie, maybe even too nice?|Fresh
Hammer is exceptionally fine in the film... while Chalamet is perfect as the indecisive youth who is drawn to this exotic stranger in ways he himself can't fully comprehend.|Fresh
Italy has never looked better on screen than it does in Sayombhu's Mukdeeprom's cinematography...|Fresh
"Raw and honest, ""Call Me By Your Name"" exposes loss of innocence while celebrating the importance of one's first love in a mature, albeit graphic, way."|Fresh
Just as the entrancing notes of the Psychedelic Furs' 'Love My Way' float through the Italian night in Call Me By Your Name, so too does the seductive, summertime-set romance's own charms.|Fresh
Set in the northern Italian town of Crema and the surrounding countryside, Call Me By Your Name is a movie marinated in sensual pleasures, not all of them having to do with sex.|Fresh
Sultry and oh-so sexy, Call Me By Your Name is a masterful piece and romantic enough to win over even the hardest of hearts.|Fresh
The film is a great ode to the power of falling in love and discovering one's own truth and identity through the reflection of another.|Fresh
In the role of the young virgin, Timothée Chalamet is engaging as the story's anchor, yet one couldn't imagine this love-dream without Hammer's presence.|Fresh
Although the material occasionally steers in the vicinity of a 1980s teen romance directed by Randall Kleiser (Summer Lovers fans, you know who you are), there's enough torment and joy generated to cast a real spell.|Fresh
An astonishing drama of sexual awakening that explores the exhilarations and anxieties that accompany first love.|Fresh
[There is] a hole at the center of what would otherwise be-and still, semi-miraculously, is-a very involving, melancholy film.|Fresh
A love affair is inevitable, but Guadagnino doesn't skim over Elio's prolonged longing, which is what makes Call Me by Your Name most potent as a coming-of-age picture, not a mere romance.|Fresh
It's probably best to take the movie for what it is: a look at a young, brilliant man who's trying to figure out his future -- and his sexuality.|Fresh
Despite all its pain, love is always worth it, the film argues-and makes you believe.|Fresh
Call My By Your Name, written for the screen by James Ivory, harkens back to the glory days of his partnership with the late Ismail Merchant, when the Merchant Ivory brand was an art-house staple.|Fresh
... Call Me By Your Name can only be described as a perfect film.|Fresh
Isolated in the Lombardy region of Italy in a villa tucked away from the sexual politics of America, the tension of the film arises not purely from the proscribed sexuality but rather the intellectual foreplay.|Fresh
It's a striking reminder of the power of memory and the idea that love lost isn't love wasted, a message that rings beautifully clear and universal no matter how singular and lasting the story of Elio and Oliver is.|Fresh
Chalamet is a revelation.|Fresh
What distinguish it from the competition are the dialogue and the acting.|Fresh
Guadagnino has coaxed from his cast a film unmatched this year for lifelike rhythms and attention to human behavior.|Fresh
Though much of Call Me By Your Name is lovely and well-crafted, it's never quite as subtle as the filmmakers seem to assume.|Rotten
"Slowly, as if in a delicate tango, the two move toward each other, and ""Call Me By Your Name"" becomes the story of a connection, both sexual and emotional."|Fresh
a glorious cinematic soak|Fresh
Few films handle coming of age with as much grace and humanity as Call Me By Your Name and the audience is as transformed by the experience as the characters.|Fresh
As a gay love story, told without judgment and without apology, it's something that would have seemed unthinkable not so very long ago - and that feels like progress.|Fresh
Every performance in this film is captivating, and the story is sweet and pure.|Fresh
Most reviewers love it. I don't.|Rotten
If there's been a better film released during 2017, I haven't seen it.|Fresh
Call Me by Your Name is a perfect, lazy, worry-free day, practically devoid of any real-world concerns and absolutely dripping with intellectual and artistic stimulation, and all manner of sexual enticement.|Fresh
It is incredibly pleasant to spend a couple of hours with characters as unashamedly smart as this. It is rare these days to find English-speaking characters who revel in the pleasures of intellectual discussion, who celebrate each other's braininess.|Fresh
By the end of this 132-minute journey, I had grown somewhat weary of the tug of war between the two leads, despite disarming efforts from Hammer and Chalamet.|Rotten
There's a lot of the unspoken in Call Me by Your Name, a perceptive film about lust, jealousy, uncertainty, repression, and, maybe, love.|Fresh
"[The] official synopsis assures us that ""Elio's sophistication and intellectual gifts suggest he is already a fully-fledged adult,"" which neither jibes with the on-screen character nor makes up for the fact that Oliver is clearly a solid decade older."|Rotten
A complicated movie, erotic yet never graphic, heartfelt yet highly stylized. Chalamet delivers one of the year's best performances.|Fresh
...so seductive, you might not notice there is a troubling streak of hedonism at its core.|Fresh
One of the year's most romantic movies, and also one of the best.|Fresh
It's a rare movie that knows when to move and when to stay still. Call Me By Your Name ... is just such a film, lazy as a late-afternoon dragonfly one moment, rash and rushed as young love the next.|Fresh
A lot of Call Me By Your Name has a hazy, meandering quality to it. In its final moments, as summer draws to a close, Ivory's script and the performances shift into sharp focus.|Fresh
... it's a beautiful coming-of-age story that hasn't been told before.|Fresh
A spellbinding, almost ecstatically beautiful movie that gains even more heft and meaning in its final transcendent moments.|Fresh
"""Call Me by Your Name"" is enough to make you move to the town of Crema, even if your rational self realizes the director Luca Guadagnino trades in a heightened, miragelike state of mythic yearning."|Fresh
A coming-of-age story exploring one's first experience with true love and sexual uncertainty, including the hypnotic pleasures of both physical and intellectual affection balanced against bittersweet heartbreak|Fresh
Both a heartwarming and heartwrenching tale of love, loss and discovery that could be my favorite film of the year. Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer and Michael Stuhlbarg give award-caliber performances in a film that is an important as it is beautiful.|Fresh
A deep and complex journey into discovery, Call Me By Your Name is an announcement that Timothee Chalamet is a new force to be reckoned with in cinema. Certainly a top contender for awards this season!|Fresh
"""Call Me By Your Name"" is transcendent in its first hour, communicating much through the camera's evocation of nature and the screenplay's clear yet subtle dialogue."|Fresh
A truly escapist romantic fantasy, the movie is awash in the romance of its setting long before things get serious between its protagonists.|Fresh
Luca Guadagnino's films are so tangible, you could live inside of them, and you'd be happy to stay there.|Fresh
Subtly stirring and sensitive drama - about a sensuous summer that could change the course of a boy's life.|Fresh
I'm still uncertain if I buy 31-year- old Armie Hammer as a 24-year- old, but man, Luca Guadagnino's Call Me by Your Name sure does sell its love story.|Fresh
It's a story of first love: impossible, impermanent, and passionate.|Fresh
Gorgeous Tuscan scenery forms the backdrop for a 17-year-old's coming of sexual age. He has the kind of father we all probably wanted.|Fresh
In what might be the most romantic movie of the year, Call Me by Your Name dispenses with cliché while focusing on the universal fantasy of first love.|Fresh
Luca Guadagnino's tale of budding gay romance in 1980s Italy is one of the most mesmerizing films of the year.|Fresh
Compared with. . .any number of films dealing with down-to-earth sexual feelings that go wild. . .Call Me By Your Name is trite. . .Few recent films have so bluntly proclaimed moral pessimism.|Rotten
[Call Me by Your Name] won't need to guilt, shame or convince to win people over. Instead this coming-of-age romance resonates something more pervasive.|Fresh
Luca Guadagnino's romantic drama Call Me By Your Name sneaks up on you -- by the end, it stings with the lingering ache of a late-summer sunburn.|Fresh
Veteran director James Ivory, the screenwriter here, has adapted Aciman's novel with delicacy and discretion. Guadagnino's visual style, on the other hand, is so swoony that one might require a fainting couch.|Fresh
The direction by Luca Guadagnino is reminiscent of Bertolucci's sensitivity at its best, the fabulous cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom rapturously captures the rich work of art that is Italy in summer, and the actors are to die for.|Fresh
It's the rare movie that dares to show us what unconditional love is, not just from romantic interests, but also from the people who love us the most and know us the best.|Fresh
Gorgeous, lyrical story of first love and desire during an Italian summer hits you right in the heart.|Fresh
Call Me by Your Name makes you remember how it felt to realize, as you became an adult, that your best experiences are ephemeral-that by the time you recognize an experience for what it is, it's already a memory.|Fresh
Although it ends on a powerful, bittersweet chord, the movie is a bit too determinedly soothing for comfort.|Fresh
Guadagnino has made the exploration of love and sexuality his mandate.|Fresh
So assailed are we by reports of harmful pleasures, and of the coercive male will being imposed through lust, that it comes as a relief to be reminded, in such style, of consensual joy.|Fresh

Raw, and real, and profoundly, indelibly moving.|Fresh
