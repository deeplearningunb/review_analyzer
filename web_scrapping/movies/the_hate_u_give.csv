A wave of furious anger rightly burns throughout 'The Hate U Give,' and it's highly likely you'll leave with that fire pulsing through your own veins.|Fresh
The Hate U Give may never stop being relative, or it may one day be a quaint reminder of systematic injustice. Regardless of what the future holds, The Hate U Give stands for something worth considering.|Fresh
While definitely directed at adolescents, that doesn't mean that anyone over 18 can't enjoy it or be moved by the passion and quietly stirring rage.|Fresh
There are some moments of great drama and plenty of provocative food for thought here. But it could all feel a bit too much like homework for the young audience it is seeking to both illuminate and mobilise.|Fresh
The Hate U Give features a strong and incredibly moving performance from Amandla Stenberg, who never holds anything back from the audience and never overplays a moment. She's a star in the making.|Fresh

... a vibrant, down-to-earth and unnervingly complex look at the socio-political climate.|Fresh
Breathtaking work by perennially underrated co-star Russell Hornsby, and a reaffirmation of Amandla Stenberg's worth as an A-list star, The Hate U Give works best in the ensemble pieces celebrating the close-knit family at the story's center.|Fresh
Why it won't end here|Fresh
One of the year's 10 Best. From BlacKkKlansman to Blindspotting to Beale Street and beyond, the issue of systematic racism informed many a movie in 2018. Yet slipping through the cracks was the most affecting one of all.|Fresh
Here is a strong, far-reaching tale of black female empowerment and dignity, a reminder that love is bigger than hate.|Fresh
The Hate U Give packs an emotional punch|Fresh
A powerful social justice drama but not necessarily a powerful film.|Fresh
Several racially-charged and involved issues are brought together in an effective story. While the film is a bit hard-bitten it seems a little too anxious to have a positive ending.|Fresh
This is a compelling story about race in contemporary America.|Fresh
The movie is adapted from the young adult novel by Angie Thomas, and the tropes of that genre-a first-person narrative about finding oneself on the way to adulthood-allow it to strike boldly at the emotions that more detached grown-up dramas might avoid.|Fresh
I was boo-hoo-ing from beginning to end...I feel like this movie clearly explains what it is to be Black in America today. It's a movie that everybody needs to see.|Fresh
The brilliance of the construction of the is how it forces us to see everything through Starr's eyes|Fresh
Amandla Stenberg is a relevation in this powerful and relevant, must-see drama. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In dealing with all of it, the book character finds her confidence and her voice. But the movie version of The Hate U Give leaves me unsure that its makers ever found theirs.|Rotten
The Hate U Give is equally an American race relations study and coming-of-age story, interweaving the two in indivisible fashion.|Fresh
The Hate U Give is an important film; it understands the suffering poor communities go through, and how economic circumstances can enflame racial tensions.|Fresh
The story is eventful and tempestuous, and Amandla Stenberg (playing Starr) is an ideal teen-drama lead - radiant yet wholly believable.|Fresh
'Violence, brutality - it's just a different name.' The Hate U Give's familiarity in its themes doesn't lessen its urgency, however.|Fresh
I had a very strong emotional reaction to this movie, which is as moving as anything I've seen this year. It packs a very strong emotional punch, by putting the viewer into a world which is way outside the comfort zone of most white people.|Fresh
Stenberg is great, and Regina Hall and, particularly, Russell Hornsby are terrific as her parents in a film that may be a little contrived and formulaic at times but should still be compulsory viewing in schools and police stations.|Fresh
The cast is great, but Stenberg really shines. And Tupac's tattoo feels more relevant than ever.|Fresh
Casting Amandla Stenberg to carry the project was an inspirational choice: She's luminous and always captivating in the part, delivering a natural performance that allows easy access to Starr's soul.|Fresh
...an engaging and emotionally-charged drama that's rife with stirring performances...|Fresh
Though it leans on the genre beats of melodrama to occasionally clunky effect in order to mine the audience's tears, it's impressive how it metabolises these moments of charged emotion in order to make its wider points.|Fresh
A powerful and essential film for today, fuelled with passion and anger but also courage and the sincere hope to see things change for the good and for always.|Fresh
"Often didactic and two-dimensional, coming across like a Black Lives Matter ""Afterschool Special,"" albeit an especially heartfelt one.... Amandla Stenberg is a winning lead."|Fresh
The Hate U Give clocks in at well over two hours, but there is so much going on that it never drags. There's humour mixed in with the tragedy. There's reason mixed in with the rage.|Fresh

The honesty of The Hate U Give makes for a gripping viewing experience that reminds you that we have to be involved, engaged, and aware of the world around us.|Fresh
This is a film that speaks so directly and so intelligently to teens and I think that is a thing to treasure.|Fresh
It's a compelling tale that's told with great energy and self-righteous anger, thanks largely to the deft skills of director George Tillman Jr. You get the impression that everyone involved in this film feels passionately about the subject matter.|Fresh
Sternberg is a talent to watch; the camera loves her.|Fresh
The Hate U Give is a defining film of 2018.|Fresh
Serious when it needs to be and hopeful whenever it can, there's gold dust in the maturity of The Hate U Give.|Fresh
Yes, there are several 'speechy' moments, but you seldom feel like you're in a social studies lesson and the complexities raised are not sugar-coated for younger viewers.|Fresh
An all-too-familiar story is told with empathy and vigour in a film arguing for tolerance, activism and change.|Fresh
Within this relatively simplistic approach to a vastly complicated issue, the actors add some nice textures to their characters.|Fresh
It's a classic coming-of-age dilemma, but hardly one irrelevant to adults.|Fresh
The Hate U Give is about right now, and feels a perfect fit for it.|Fresh
It's not always the most seamless of hybrids and occasionally the joins show in the casting choices and the didactic expository dialogue, but the film is held together by a strong performance by Amandla Stenberg.|Fresh
The Hate U Give offers a worthy primer on racial issues in the age of Black Lives Matter.|Fresh

Tillman's effort is a thoughtful, well-made film and a moving effort to address a complex issue.|Fresh
The Hate U Give incorporates gangster elements, social media controversy, and heavy-handed takes on identity politics, but at its core is the story of a young woman seizing control over her narrative.|Fresh
While the film simplifies the story somewhat, it never loses its heart, the brilliant emerging of Starr into her own voice and pride in the community that lifts her up.|Fresh
Despite the teen friendly sheen this material is presented with, it still packs a strong emotional punch.|Fresh
Unforgettable thanks to a superb central performance from Amandla Stenberg|Fresh
Powerful and emotionally evocative - with timely political/cultural relevancy|Fresh
Right here, right now, Starr Carter is a true screen rebel, entirely deserving of your respect and love.|Fresh
The Hate U Give should be seen by everyone, but especially by those who move through the world with the veil of white privilege - because as triumphant as The Hate U Give is as a movie, it is even more so for what you can learn from it.|Fresh
Thomas's story is more involving because it places individuals front and center. Because Starr is less enmeshed in her various relationships, the movie ultimately becomes more about the slogans.|Rotten
It would be a serious mistake to just chalk this up to being just another coming of age film.|Fresh
The Hate U Give has a lot on its mind, and it makes its case very well. More, it makes its statements seem like questions, and its observations are wrapped in potent, absorbing storytelling.|Fresh
[The] top two-thirds of this movie is an excellent depiction of a reality that's often over-simplified and has a lot of gray area.|Fresh
...an important contribution to bridging the racial divide. Let's hope people are paying attention.|Fresh

The Hate U Give maintains a terrific sense of what's at stake in every moment, even as it tries to corral every topical issue it can find.|Fresh
The real-world social problems here make a teen movie like Love, Simon look toothless by comparison and make The Hate U Give into something rare and useful.|Fresh
A bold and galvanic central turn and a ridiculously ambitious political agenda push this moving teenage melodrama far beyond the parameters of its own wonky sales pitch.|Fresh
Hopefully, The Hate U Give will spark conversations around the country and inspire compassion in those who are still set in their unfortunate and intolerable ways.|Fresh
The Hate U Give isn't therefore supplying answers as much as presenting the questions in their true-to-life situations for us to confront.|Fresh
The Hate U Give tells an, unfortunately, all too familiar story from a point-of-view few of us will ever know, and in doing so creates one of the most powerful movies of the year.|Fresh
While this isn't the first film even this year to deal with this subject matter, it still feels fresh and raw, and the performances are good. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
This coming-of-age tale is a galvanizing force for good, and a radical powder keg full of soul-quaking performances and an uncompromised, unfiltered and unflinching message.|Fresh
What's missing ... is a narrative focus to match the movie's political passion.|Rotten
Even though it belabors some of its points, the movie as a whole makes an effective and lasting emotional impact.|Fresh
The core performance of Amandla Stenberg is dope...you felt the emotions she was going through.|Fresh
One of the most necessary movies on race and respect in years, a clear-eyed and strong-voiced call to everyone.|Fresh
The Hate U Give has a fierce storytelling grip.|Fresh
'The Hate U Give' works to present the story in a balanced manner. The police officer who did the shooting is not demonized - in fact, he is barely seen after the incident.|Fresh
Author Angie Thomas' frustration radiates off the page and screen, and Amandla Stenberg's Starr Carter is the ideal storyteller for that outrage. The Hate U Give is a primal scream.|Fresh
"Freighted with importance, politically potent, it's still more a good movie of its ""moment"" than a great film."|Fresh
The Hate U Give doesn't condescend the audience (or its characters), rather offering a sparring glimpse that, by telling these stories, we can glide through our racially divided country with the goal of bringing some of us together.|Fresh
A strong, empathetic film that deserves to be widely seen.|Fresh
The drama in The Hate U Give is always necessarily heightened, but with the film at over two hours long, it can sometimes feel exhausting. But it's hard to criticize the film for this, because that exhaustion is part of the point.|Fresh
...despite the long running time, there isn't one minute that feels unnecessary.|Fresh
Floating somewhere between an after-school special and a serious look at race relations, a sparkling performance from Amandla Stenberg acts as our spot-on guide through both venues.|Fresh
Starr's struggles of identity, of truth, of justice, of adolescence and womanhood capture the tear-filled feelings of daily American crisis.|Fresh
The Hate U Give is powerful and should be compulsory viewing. Its simple approach to these complex issues is appreciated, and makes its clear point accessible to the young audience for whom it was created.|Fresh

Grief and comedy are almost always intertwined, and Wells' script fearlessly allows laughter to fill the dark void at any number of surprising occasions.|Fresh

Powerful police shooting drama and insightful depiction of preconceptions about race. A genuine star is born in Amandla Stenberg.|Fresh
If Tillman's pacing is slow, he's also able to consistently deliver emotional wallops by simply letting his performers do their work.|Fresh
Like its young heroine, The Hate U Give is earnest, impassioned and spoiling to be heard.|Fresh
It's a film that may one day be required viewing for adolescents, and it might just change them the way that these events change its protagonist.|Fresh
Since the inception of this country these stories have been told, and finally in 2018 they are being given the platform to finally be heard. And we must listen.|Fresh
Hopefully this is a movie that will make a difference and cut through the noise.|Fresh
This film could have very easily veered off into preachy condescension, but Tillman's direction and Wells' script keep it honest while allowing the emotional impact to develop organically.|Fresh
The Hate U Give isn't a perfect piece of cinematic activism or even a narratively balanced bit of storytelling, but it's still perfect in all the ways that matter most.|Fresh
What I like best about The Hate U Give, which was adapted from a bestselling YA novel by Angie Thomas, is how firmly it keeps its focus on its young heroine.|Fresh
While the film possesses a great deal of compassion, humor and warmth, it's response to injustice that makes for one of the most startlingly visceral films of the year.|Fresh
Strikes a perfect balance between coming-of-age story and social-justice-warrior manifesto, never resorting to slogans, clichés or cardboard characters.|Fresh
For as naturalistic and real as The Hate U Give is, it goes off the rails just a little bit at the climax to make its grand point... , but there is too much heart here to really nitpick at a little hyperbole.|Fresh
Stenberg, as the film's locus, is never less than true and magnetic, and there are many strong scenes. Most importantly, there's never one second of doubt that this movie is expressing something real.|Fresh
he Hate U Give is a devastating triumph and powerful emotional critique of the current racial zeitgeist in America today and deserves to be seen by everyone, no matter which side of the color barrier you're on.|Fresh
A grim reminder of just how tough it is to be young, marginalized and black in a merciless environment oblivious of your plight.|Fresh
One of the most powerfully honest movies of 2018.|Fresh
The film runs 132 minutes, but everything in it is vital.|Fresh
"I'd say ""The Hate U Give"" is the most important movie your teenagers will see this year, but that would be selling it short for yourself. So maybe go see it together. If they'll have you."|Fresh
"""The Hate U Give"" succeeds or fails on Stenberg, and she carries the load."|Fresh
While the ending seems a bit too neat, there's value in this earnest examination, directed by George Tillman Jr., about how kids learn to be activists. Regina Hall and Russell Hornsby are very good as Starr's parents.|Fresh
Films like this serve a greater/necessary educational purpose for those who don't see the pattern in why injustices like the murders of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Laquan McDonald, etc., are a problem.|Fresh
This impassioned and incisive adaptation of the novel by Angie Thomas keeps a complex story and a wide array of characters in energetic, compassionate balance.|Fresh
It tells a young woman's powerful coming-of-age story at a time when that process involves code-switching and discovering political agency as much as it does finding the right dress to wear to prom.|Fresh
In addition to the unsettling racial and social themes, The Hate U Give also ably shows the life of a modern teenage girl.|Fresh
It's a message movie, but it never forgets the human dimension.|Fresh
An of-this-moment, vitally urgent story about race, culture, and America in 2018, but also a deeply human, deeply moving exploration of the most universal themes.|Fresh
Thought provoking and emotionally resonant, The Hate U Give is unwavering in its honesty. It is a story that pierces the heart of the racial divide in America. Amandla Stenberg deserves an Oscar nomination.|Fresh
The movie feels instructional without getting too preachy, taking time to explain various inequalities and barriers facing black Americans, typically in exchanges between father and daughter.|Fresh
If this is what the next wave of YA adaptation will feel like, we are in a good place.|Fresh
A great young adult drama, unique in how it deals with a specific social issue. It is challenging, as it should be, because cinema should deal with what's happening in the world.|Fresh
The film is released with the crucial midterm election just next month. After watching, hopefully people will be inspired to vote to stop the hate that is currently being given to us every day by the Trump administration.|Fresh
Far from perfect, the film is worth the time, and something we can learn from.|Fresh
The film's narrative power is such that what could have been merely a message movie is something larger, an empathy-driven family drama about people living in a fractured country that is all too recognizable.|Fresh
The Hate U Give gives people a shared language with which to unite and fight oppression. If all it does is teach a generation of Starrs to use their voice, that alone would be profound.|Fresh

The wealth of talent on view is almost staggering. Amandla Stenberg carries the weight of the film giving Starr just enough juice to grow from humble vulnerable teen to a courageous protestor.|Fresh
An Oscar-worthy masterpiece that defines power.|Fresh
A paradoxically angry crowd-pleaser drawn in broad emotional strokes, The Hate U Give is an exemplary post-Black Lives Matter story of political consciousness-raising.|Fresh
"Ultimately, ""The Hate U Give"" is a life-affirming rebuttal to apathy, despair and surrender. It's also one of the year's most important films."|Fresh
"At its best, it will force you to look at the society we've created and perpetuate and ask, ""Can we do better?"""|Fresh
A teen-movie milestone that tackles the uncomfortable issue of racism in an engaging and relatable way.|Fresh
In my opinion, this is up there with some of the best movies I've seen this year.|Fresh
Ms. Stenberg, Mr. Hornsby and others in the ensemble (including Regina Hall as Starr's mother, Lisa) are more than capable of exploring their characters' depths, but a wonky script gets them only so far.|Rotten
The movie is mostly smart, and shrewd, and Stenberg is, in a word, terrific.|Fresh
The Hate U Give ... occasional clumsiness aside, offers love and commitment as the antidote to that which ails us. Hard to argue with that.|Fresh
An impassioned drama about a critical topic, and Amandla Stenberg is the shining light at its center.|Fresh

Amandla Stenberg impresses in this hard-hitting Hollywood drama.|Fresh
Its dead seriousness lends this engrossing film urgency.|Fresh
"Like the best of ""young adult fiction,"" it forces sheltered viewers to walk around in someone else's shoes. Someone who's voice has too often been marginalized in popular media."|Fresh
Powerful, thought-provoking drama about race, activism.|Fresh
Stenberg gives a stunning and powerful portrayal of seething, bubbling rage at the injustice that she can endure no longer. But what keeps [it] from veering into the melodramatic... territory is that it commits to fleshing out its characters fully.|Fresh
"""Hate"" brings up vital discussions for a society wrestling with a lack of empathy, understanding and tolerance. They're raising their voices with a cinematic megaphone, and it's our turn to listen."|Fresh
Powerful and obviously topical, the adaptation of Angie Thomas' award-winning 2017 novel is one for all ages.|Fresh
This Oscar-worthy drama is a superhero origin story and YA fantasy flick stripped of metaphor and made bracingly real.|Fresh
The Hate U Give does right by its source material, star, and subject. Like any good teen movie, it includes triumph-and in many ways, it is one itself.|Fresh
Led by a powerful performance by Amandla Stenberg, The Hate U Give offers has something to say not only about police brutality but the ways in which we respond.|Fresh
Amandla Stenberg is a tour de force transforming into an empoweringly enraged ball of fury directed at the hate around her from adults that directly affects all generations. Tupac would approve|Fresh
The film lays out the complexities of contemporary race relations with a deliberateness that frequently edges over into didacticism.|Rotten
For black people to put aside their disputes with police and work with them to clean up crime in the black community turns out to be the only solution. Makes sense to me. But I sure didn't expect to hear it in a Hollywood movie.|Fresh
"In a year that has featured ""Black Panther,"" ""Black Klansman,"" ""Sorry to Bother You"" and ""Blindspotting,"" who would have predicted that an adaptation of a YA novel would be the year's most trenchant exploration of racial injustice in today's America."|Fresh

'The Hate U Give' is wholesome and heartbreaking. It's visceral and at the same time makes so much sense.|Fresh
The film, directed by George Tillman Jr. and adapted by Audrey Wells, smartly streamlines characters and plots from the book, while inevitably losing some of the neighborhood color that made the novel and its characters feel so rich.|Fresh
This is not a film that allows you, for even a moment, to hope that children will be unaffected by the hate that surrounds them. It faces that issue head-on and challenges audiences to do something about it.|Fresh
The Hate U Give succeeds spectacularly. It's anchored by Stenberg's dynamic performance, but the rest of the cast is uniformly terrific.|Fresh
[Tillman, Jr.] gets solid work from the cast, especially the charismatic Smith, Regina Hall and Russell Hornsby as Starr's supportive parents and Stenberg, whose transition from conflicted girl to angry and empowered activist is thrilling to watch.|Fresh
There is insight, detail and pertinent relevance to this film that cannot be shaken.|Fresh
I cannot the remember the last time that I was this emotionally impacted by a film. I found myself constantly holding back tears from the moment the film began until it ended.|Fresh
It's a film that contains multitudes, and only asks for a world willing to do the same.|Fresh
Put simply, The Hate U Give is one of the best films of the year.|Fresh

Despite the melodramatic ending, you leave the theater wanting to root for the film and its characters.|Fresh
George Tillman Jr. has created something unforgettable.|Fresh
"Entertaining, enraging, and ultimately deeply moving, ""The Hate U Give"" is poised to be a hit, and deserves to be."|Fresh

Solidly engineered to engage viewers across racial/economic/political spectrums.|Fresh
