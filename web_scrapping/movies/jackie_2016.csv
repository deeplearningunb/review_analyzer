Natalie Portman gives a virtuoso performance as Jackie, capturing her breathy feminine tones and the fashion-plate public image that hides inner devastation, hinting at a contained breakdown in the privacy of her own empty bedroom.|Fresh
This film paints a complex picture of a woman who lost her tether to the world and gained her power back by creating a legend.|Fresh
An intoxicating and quietly horrific look at one of the most public tragedies of the 20th century, that overcomes the flaws in the screenplay due to strong performances and direction.|Fresh
As we dip in and out of the life of Jackie Onassis, Larraín maintains a fierce sense of focus. This is not Jackie's biography. It is a portrait of her grief.|Fresh
The film crystallises Jackie's dignity and pathos, and, also crucially, the sheer brutality of a way of life being completely wrenched from someone in a matter of hours.|Fresh
It's a performance that doesn't quite transcend. I never felt like I was watching Portman become Kennedy, but more of Portman just playing Kennedy, but it is still stirring in its own right.|Fresh
Jackie looks at the assassination and aftermath through the widow's eyes, which is a haunting examination of the intersection of loss and legacy that is led by a powerful performance by Natalie Portman.|Fresh
Natalie Portman's performance carries the film entirely.|Fresh
The lion's share of praise that will be heaped upon Jackie will largely fall at the foot of Portman, and rightfully so, but there's still a lot to love beyond the soulful performance at the centre of the film.|Fresh
Portman's vivid portrayal is the film's greatest strength, coasting through woebegone New England accents and the script's on-the-nose airing of themes in the final act.|Rotten

Portman's performance does hint at an inner strength, particularly in the magazine interview, but the script betrays her.|Rotten
At a very brisk 95 minutes, Larraín's Jackie is stripped of any fluff or distractions and is streamlined for maximum focus on a moment in American history so steeped in controversy and conspiracy by focusing on the most human element of it.|Fresh
Natalie Portman, who stars as the Iconic former First Lady, is sure to get plenty of awards nods for her finely nuanced portrayal.|Fresh
A subtle, mesmerizing, mind-altering character study.|Fresh
Larrain's picture is a curious but engaging affair.|Fresh
It's enlightening and insightful, using unusually creative filming, to experience Jackie's life and perspective firsthand.|Fresh
"""Jackie"" struggles in its pacing. It's Natalie Portman that saves the film from flat-lining completely and her performance is one that is far superior than the film itself."|Rotten
While many small details are profoundly beautiful, Larraín's attempt feels weighed down by self-importance, as if history were a wet blanket of one's own making that is ultimately inescapable.|Rotten
Portman's performance and Larraín's flowing camera overcome a screenplay that too often seems like a one-act play. They do more than just move a play outdoors. They explode it into lush, grand visions of American history.|Rotten
Although the film suffers from complacency, it is still a visual spectacle, full of emotions, great performances, an impressive production design and above all, much intimacy within the pain. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Not without aesthetic interest, the movie is still a complete mess, weighed down by an expositional script and extremely mannered performances.|Rotten
Shot beautifully by cinematographer Stephanes Fontaine. The haunting score by composer Mica Levi drives home the grief felt through the entire picture.|Fresh
Sometimes when people say a film is all about one singular performance, it's meant as a slight. In Jackie, that's the point.|Fresh
And yet, for every element in Jackie that's obvious and overplayed, there are stray, marginal details that manage to resonate, moments during which the pretense falls away and its amorphous stew of ideas finally coalesce.|Fresh
"""Jackie"" shows us how Kennedy gave birth to the legend of the modern-day Camelot, but it also captures the ongoing evolution of a star, right before our eyes."|Fresh
As much as Jackie is about emotional process, it is also about Kennedy's liberation.|Fresh
An examination of the character and her need to purge or repair her pain. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Portman does a tremendous job balancing an accurate impersonation of Mrs. Kennedy's unique voice and mannerisms with a performance that is genuine and fresh.|Fresh
In her portrayal of former First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman is absolutely superb in Jackie.|Fresh
Director Pablo Larraín's biopic JACKIE is soaked in atmosphere, bleeding emotion, life, death, happiness, sadness and anxiety.|Fresh
A disturbingly intimate portrayal of Jacqueline Kennedy, 'Jackie' is a film that unmasks her in such a tender yet objective manner; you feel like an intruder who is tailing the first lady of America and a widow in her most trying time.|Fresh
It's one of the must-sees of this award season.|Fresh
It's easy to recognize some of the shared elements between Jackie and Neruda. But it's still striking to see Larraín tackle such quintessentially American material (and with a largely different crew) and managing to hit the mark so cleanly once again.|Fresh
If Jackie has a conceptual emblem, this is it: messy reality splattering all over a carefully maintained façade.|Rotten
Pale and gaunt, Portman not only looks the part - those vintage costumes are perfect for her - she manages to channel the grief and pain powerfully.|Fresh
Not your typical biopic, Jackie is an extraordinary exploration of a complex woman navigating her loss, her children's grief and a nation through an unprecedented political and personal tragedy. Don't miss it.|Fresh
It's an intensity that never lets up - you have to take your moments to stop and remember to inhale and exhale when you can. But that intensity is also to the film's detriment, as at no point does it allow warmth to seep in.|Rotten
Jackie is too focused to teach history to the young and too invasive to appeal to the old, who watched TV that November.|Rotten
Portman's portrayal is nothing less than amazing, perfectly capturing Jacqueline's intense drive, strength, occasional pettiness, and overwhelming grief.|Fresh
Jackie is a self-serious affair, and despite its dedication to getting under the skin of the former first lady, it remains largely on the surface of things - glossy, sleek, and to a certain extent oddly detached.|Rotten
Pablo Larraín's disappointing Jacqueline Kennedy biopic tries but ultimately fails to reconcile the person with the persona.|Rotten
It tries not to fall into cheap patriotism and for the most part succeeds, but more than anything is the Portman show. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Here's how you know the new film Jackie is working: You move from trying to decide just how credible Natalie Portman's impersonation is to thinking about anything and everything except that.|Fresh
For the most part ... Jackie keeps things clear and preserves its subject's sadness in amber.|Fresh
A look at a woman who uses the cameras to transmit the version that suits her. Part of Jackie's success lies in not knowing when we are seeing the woman or her creation. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As a whole, the movie is very cold. Director Pablo Larraín shoots much of it in a very controlled, almost Kubrickian way|Rotten
A movie that is as brilliant as it is frustrating.|Fresh
This is essentially asking us to celebrate the birth of spin in modern politics.|Rotten
Larraín is an artist, and his skills show throughout, both in his ability to meld so many different sequences into a narrative whole and in how effectively he uses Portman to portray one of the world's most memorable figures.|Fresh
Jackie is a great recreation of a very important time and context, but it didn't stimulated me emotionally or intellectually as much as I would have liked. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Jackie may not be the highest point in the Chilean filmmaker's career, but there's enough material in the film to avoid going unnoticed. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
While the movie may not sit well with those looking for perhaps a more conventional Hollywood approach to biopics, it is worth seeing for Ms. Portman's outstanding performance alone.|Fresh
The emotions are muted, suggested in gestures and details, as is the drama. Jackie doesn't deliver the catharsis you might expect from the subject matter. It's more interested in the nuances of character...|Fresh
The center of the whole film is Jackie and neither the witty narrative nor Larraín's staging would have worked were if not for Natalie Portman's performance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What a tense, absorbing, startling film it is. Natalie Portman is simply astounding.|Fresh
The result of the film is in some ways a bit disconcerting, but - beyond certain moments dominated by coldness and calculation - it's still a valuable film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Distinct and sensitive, this unique feature offers an emotional and enthralling look at the former first lady.|Fresh
"""Jackie"" is artful when it needs to be heartful; its overly ambitious visual dramatics are often a glass wall between Portman and the audience. But when she breaks through it, watch out."|Fresh
The director shows us the mourning as a staging, but doesn't condemn, shows; criticizes and also builds bridges for compassion. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that questions the show within the show, opening up to unpublished meditations and contexts, to continue surviving adversity and internal dismemberment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It ended up pushing me further away from the character. In other words, I can appreciate the formal achievements of the film, but what surrounds this calculated and talented woman couldn't interest me less. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Despite some impressive visual flourishes - the slain President's limousine racing to the hospital - the much-hyped Jackie is ultimately a big let-down.|Rotten
Portman does a stellar job of drawing out all the hundred emotions of sadness, grief and hopelessness that one would have thought are humanly possible. Her performance, however, is not as nuanced and varied as in the... Black Swan.|Fresh
Jackie, the first English-language film by Chilean director Pablo Larraín, offers a compellingly uneasy and nuanced portrait of one of the best-known first ladies in American history, engagingly played by Natalie Portman.|Fresh
As a tightly controlled exploration of the pageantry of grief, Jackie works very well, even when the stylisation tips into excess and the close-ups begin to feel more intrusive than intimate.|Fresh
An artificially enlarged portrait that has empty, superficial and apolitical reflections. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Although the film doesn't reveal any secrets, it constructs a dramatically powerful x-ray of what Jackie might have experienced. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director Larraín, working from a script by Noah Oppenheim, delivers a frequently mesmerizing drama that benefits greatly from Portman's striking performance...|Fresh
Natalie Portman shines on Jackie, a film that is far from the traditional biopic, focusing on the feelings that follow a tragedy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Pablo Larraín's direction ties every loose strand together with ease and grace, his camera condemning, challenging, coaxing out meaning, and wringing beauty from a bloodstained pink suit.|Fresh
A spiritual look at Jacqueline Kennedy's search for meaning after the death of her beloved husband.|Fresh
It manages to circumvent the conventions of biopics or ordinary historical films thanks to its spooky but alway sober atmosphere loyal to the period portrayed. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The minimalist style of the film, full of silences, sounds like the tears of a woman as they hit the ground. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Jackie is a mesmerising tour de force, as brutal as it is gentle and as jaw-droppingly gorgeous as it is bleak.|Fresh
An educated and transparent film, which tries not so much to reconstruct or imitate reality as to recreate it on the inside and make it possible in the strict margins of the myth. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Portman, with her fabulous upper-crust accent, is the best thing in this piece, essentially a longish radio play.|Fresh
Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy is perfectly imperfect in one of her best roles until today and the music of Mica Levi drags us to follow the same path of despair that she must have had. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This idiosyncratic polysemy is gradually digestible thanks to a well-grounded narrative structure. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The great performance of Natalie Portman, the incredible score by Mica Levi, and the direction of Pablo Larraín make a very relevant reflection on modern celebrity culture.|Fresh
Politics is given a back seat, and that's what makes Jackie interesting - it unspools as a deep character study of its subject rather than a history lesson.|Fresh
Portman skilfully mimics Jackie's mannerisms but more importantly, you understand her character's complexities.|Fresh
Jackie is one of the most conflicted films I've had the pleasure of watching. It is good -- but it does take a while to work out exactly what type of film it is supposed to be.|Fresh
An incredibly immersive experience that is hard to shake after the credits role, a film that illuminates and moves in its artistry and its spirit.|Fresh
"Portman returns to form in ""Jackie."""|Fresh
It feels both random but suddenly relevant today, when the American presidency has become something other than Camelot.|Fresh
That the film is nearly as good as Portman's performance is remarkable.|Fresh
This is Portman's film through and through: she gives one of her best performances (better even than her Oscar-winning turn in Black Swan).|Fresh
It's a time-fractured but close-focused look at the bereaved First Lady, and thanks to Natalie Portman's performance as the fragile, ferocious Jackie, it's one of the strongest dramas of the year.|Fresh
A fine film boasting some notably detailed period recreation...As a historical drama about how a nation looked to a single person for its cue about how to react to the murder of its leader the film does make for a solid, if somewhat repetitive, journey.|Fresh
While brilliant French cinematographer Stephane Fontaine paints the picture, Noah Oppenheim's screenplay makes you wonder why it's taken so long to essay this endlessly fascinating historical figure.|Fresh
Bizarre yet irresistible.|Fresh
Portman is excellent but it's hard not to know why the story is being told.|Rotten
From the saddening glissando strings of the opening theme, with its falling invocations of death and discord, Levi provides the unifying emotional glue for Larraín's deliberately shattered film.|Fresh
A brilliant depiction of shock.|Fresh
With eyes wide and startled, pale skin drawn tightly over cheekbones, Portman is hypnotic.|Fresh
It's a complex, provocative film, artfully directed by Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larrain and anchored by a riveting performance from Natalie Portman.|Fresh
Clever, beautiful images about a clever, beautiful image-maker.|Fresh
Portman's portrayal of explosive yet restrained grief packs a punch, and Jackie's loneliness is palpable, emphasised by the White House's enormous rooms, Mica Levi's disquieting score... and cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine's long shots.|Fresh
[An] engagingly unconventional chronicle of the days between JFK's assassination and his elaborate state funeral.|Fresh
[Jackie Kennedy] is played to perfection by Natalie Portman.|Fresh
Don't expect a comprehensive biopic of the wife, mother, widow, tastemaker and White House style icon. This is a rigorous exploration of Jackie Kennedy's steely determination ...|Fresh
Daringly intimate and unusually insightful, Jackie sees a South American provocateur take on an all-American idol - and the results are unforgettable.|Fresh
A fascinating film with a complex, moving performance from Natalie Portman, sounding strangely like Marilyn Monroe in places, and a sentimental belief in the enduring promise of Kennedy's brief, shining moment as president.|Fresh
In a word: Oscars!|Fresh
By immersing us in Jackie Kennedy's (Natalie Portman) subjective experience rather than observing her from the outside, Larraín gets closer than a traditional biopic to capturing an individual's capacity to shape history.|Fresh
Was I riveted by Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy? I was... But was I aware it was Natalie Portman, Acting? Always. And there isn't much else here.|Rotten
For all the bustle around her, the film insists on Jackie's aloneness and Portman gives a performance in which there is as much tantalisingly concealed as fearlessly exposed.|Fresh
It is well made, handsomely furnished, punctiliously designed and the use of Richard Burton's sonorous tones on the Kennedys' LP of the musical Camelot is a nice moment.|Fresh
There is kitsch but no corn in this piercingly intelligent film. Even the press-interview framing device, a tired trope in some cinema, proves its sly mettle.|Fresh
Has almost unbearable extra resonance in these waning days of the Obama administration ... The themes are big but the focus is tight as a drum ... astonishingly effective production and costume design ... Portman [give]s [a] tremendous performance.|Fresh

It's the incongruity of the Jackie Kennedy story told in Pablo Larrain's Jackie that makes the film so compelling.|Fresh
The woman comes across as imperious, mercurial and sometimes eccentric, but always real.|Fresh
Larraín has made an incomparable film on the process of moving queasily into uncertainty.|Fresh
To be moved by this film, directed by Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larraín, it is important to absorb it as a visual experience first and allow yourself to be entranced by its images.|Fresh

Breathes life, hope, blood, sweat and tears into despair.|Fresh
A captivating and unflinching portrait of private grief amidst one of history's most public tragedies.|Fresh
Jackie does what the very best biopics should: it makes you view someone you've seen countless times as if you were seeing them anew.|Fresh
Portman's Oscar-worthy work crowns an unconventional study of an icon, while Mica Levi's score is sublime.|Fresh

Immensely powerful.|Fresh
Natalie Portman's performance is as good as everyone says.|Fresh
Working from a nuanced script by Noah Oppenheim, Larrain has fashioned a solemn film that mourns what never came to be more than what was lost.|Fresh
A beautiful, bewildering film that bounces from haunting to overblown and back again without a moment's notice, ending up an oddity most befitting of its subject.|Fresh
The entire movie resonates with an authenticity that stems from Portman's performance. From the wardrobe to the re-creation of historical moments, there are no shortcuts taken.|Fresh
[Jackie] is held together by a startling performance by Natalie Portman, who goes beyond mere chameleonic imitation and offers something truly emotionally wrenching.|Fresh
A fascinating, high energy, character study and well worth your time if you don't mind the emotional cost.|Fresh
A bewitching study of mythmaking that underlines Pablo Larraín's status as cinema's most daring political filmmaker.|Fresh
Portman and Larrain have done a terrific job presenting a complex, conflicted and often-contradictory character, who struggled at times to be the person others wanted her to be.|Fresh
This is a cinema of no escape, and few if any actors will have to shoulder the same burden of expressive responsibility this year - yet the never-better Portman simply shines beneath it, giving a performance of mesmeric complexity and commitment.|Fresh
Larrain has carried off a perfect fusion of the personal and the political. The story of one woman's loss has become a study in America's sustaining need to turn its leaders into myth.|Fresh
This film is less an isolated Jackie Kennedy biopic than a dark and conceptual statement on how the American people classifies, experiences and remembers historic tragedies.|Fresh
By the end of the film, Portman has drained the iconic Jacqueline Kennedy of every last drop of her famously fluid grace and poise, and we have watched it harden into resilience and defiance.|Fresh
If the winners write history, the survivors become guardians of the legacy.|Fresh
...sets the new standard for the biopic genre against which all future attempts will likely be measured.|Fresh
Pablo Larrain has crafted a visually stunning and emotionally raw film but what really brings Jackie to life is Natalie Portman's extraordinarily complex performance.|Fresh
[Jackie is] a tour de force that works precisely because it doesn't have to be totally convincing, just insightful.|Fresh
An intelligent and emotional biographical piece. It's the tragedy in the face of a young widow. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
From the beginning of the film, with its mournful, atonal music score by Mica Levi, it's obvious that this is no conventional dramatisation of the events that arguably brought to an end America's innocence.|Fresh
There are two narratives at war in Jackie: One is a decent but disposable showcase of dialogue, the other a masterpiece streaming through sentiments.|Fresh
History comes to life and a former First Lady becomes a walking ghost in Pablo Larraín's strange, disquieting biopic, Jackie.|Fresh
Torture-lot.|Rotten
Yes, the actress nails Jackie's soft, breathy, almost brittle voice. Yes, she moves about with the perfect posture and grace that Kennedy was known for. Yet her Jackie rarely feels lived-in.|Rotten
A movie like this stands or falls by its lead performance. Fall it does.|Fresh
[Here is an] ill-conceived movie further hobbled by an inarticulate script ineptly executed by miscast actors - gross political exploitation at its lowest.|Rotten
One could excuse the lack of factual detail if the movie had some focused impression to suggest.|Rotten
Viewers who were alive and witnessed it will find it inspiring. Those who were not will find it flat.|Fresh
The film is not a document, nor a myth, nor a political indictment, but a completely subjective, artfully wrought fragment of the American mystique.|Fresh
A brilliant performance surrounded by an otherwise unremarkable movie. (Splice Today)|Fresh
Director Pablo Larraín's Jackie is a powerful if traumatic achievement, in approach as well as execution. So is Natalie Portman's performance in the title role.|Fresh
... A mesmerizing picture that stays with you after the lights go up, but it's not one to be enjoyed.|Fresh
It is, in its own way, a eulogy not just to Camelot but to the American dream itself. It is grace in the midst of madness.|Fresh
...a psychodrama more than a standard biopic.|Fresh
We've known for some time that Natalie Portman is a fine actress, but with her portrayal of Jacqueline Kennedy she steps into the front ranks.|Fresh
Portman's body language, a profound interior burn, is brilliant.|Fresh
Jackie paints a chilling portrait of the former first lady, spectacularly portrayed by Natalie Portman, in the moments and days after her husband's assassination in Dallas.|Fresh
The success of any biopic rests squarely on the shoulders of the actor playing the subject, and Natalie Portman harnesses every bit of the strength and fragility she displayed in her Oscar-winning role in 2010's Black Swan to astounding effect.|Fresh
Love and ambition struggle again, this time to world-shaping effect without and (in the devastating last scenes) despair within.|Fresh
The film doesn't dwell exploitively on these things. It just makes abundantly clear what this woman was dealing with when she insisted on dealing with the details of her husband's funeral.|Fresh
The serviceable movie you make about this subject. But it does offer a little bit more, peeking through with an interesting insight every quarter-hour or so.|Fresh
Portman's performance reaches past mere impersonation to capture her sense of dignity that allowed her, in the face of her husband's horrific death, to complete the task of establishing his place in history.|Fresh
There's no denying Portman's depiction of class and grace under pressure, capturing the emotions of that time and showing people who were scared and confused a way to heal.|Fresh
Natalie Portman's performance is a masterpiece of carefully controlled emotion...|Fresh
... 'Jackie' is an extraordinary and intimate look at an iconic figure who put her stamp on the White House, the nation and our perception of grace and beauty.|Fresh
An impressionistic portrait that says more in images than in words.|Fresh
Larrain spins a tale of dignified anguish and calculations less sympathetic. Anchored by Natalie Portman's uncanny impersonation - wispy voice, aristocratic posture - Jackie fascinates and frustrates, sometimes at once.|Fresh
The film instead becomes preoccupied with trendy period detail and the mannered performance of its star, rather than in finding deeper truths about the subject.|Rotten
"The best film about any Kennedy since ""JFK."" This is not a safe, comfortable, amber-encased reminiscence people may want. It's a mesmerizing, insidious suggestion of how deep the American political rot may run and for how long it has done so."|Fresh
Jackie breaks new ground inside the biopic genre, thanks to a magnificent direction by Pablo Larráin and Natalie Portman's best performance to date. One of the best films of 2016. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Natalie Portman is sensational in what ends up as a powerful, intimate and award-worthy portrait of a very public grief.|Fresh
Natalie Portman delivers a tremendous performance in a movie that marches to its own beat without ever taking its eye off the ball.|Fresh
This is a cinematic work of art, and taking the time to see it in a theatre should be priority number one.|Fresh
There's an eerie rightness: the bright Dallas sun; the long Washington shadows; the delicate bouclé of that pink Chanel suit; the clarion clip-clop along Pennsylvania Avenue.|Fresh
Portman's scarily composed performance is laser-focused, an act of empathy without tears.|Fresh
Jackie proves that grace and composure are qualities that matter in our leaders in a year when many Americans want to deny it.|Fresh
Whether...this amounts to much more than a bit of tabloidism with pretensions...is open to question.|Rotten
The casting of Portman turns out to have been perfect.|Fresh
Jackie begins at a fever pitch and never lets up. What Noah Oppenheim's dazzling screenplay & Pablo Lorrain's direction manage to thrust us back in time and make us see a series of historical events in a way we never have before|Fresh
All the perfectly manicured technical elements assembled by Larraín are the reasons to watch Jackie, even as they overwhelm a slight and not particularly revealing story.|Fresh
How about just telling the story straight?|Rotten
It is a fever dream of a movie, tracking its subject as she tries to maintain control, maintain her composure, her sanity.|Fresh
Enormously moving, but flawed.|Fresh
Larrain's gorgeously grim and austere vision bolsters a bravura performance from Natalie Portman. She inhabits Jackie as a woman who has been shaken to her core with grief.|Fresh
Jackie's power is in the sticky quality of the moments of pure cinematic composition. Those images, moments and chords in the score flicker in your memory long after the viewing.|Fresh
"""Jackie"" is mesmerizing; a familiar story told from an entirely different angle."|Fresh
It's an impressively bold go at such a revered presidency, and much of the project's success hangs on Natalie Portman's fully immersed and utterly mesmerizing portrait of the grieving first widow.|Fresh
How do you dramatise history on film without adding a large dollop of fiction to the mix? Many have tried and most have failed. But Pablo Larraín succeeds better than many with Jackie.|Fresh
It's a very intimate character study that shows this woman, who is known for her poise, break down like any other human being.|Fresh
...wrenching and unforgettable|Fresh
Portman nails the intonation and characteristics of the famous First Lady without them ever feeling like imitation|Fresh
Larrain succeeds - to a point. His hindrance is Portman, whose Jackie exists without an inner-life.|Fresh
Portman reconciles the indulgent and extravagant aspects of Jackie's character with the strong-willed first lady looking to create something for the American people out of a nationwide tragedy.|Fresh
Revealing her strength during the end of the presidential Camelot, 'Jackie' is a royal depiction.|Fresh
Portman's Jackie is certainly haughty (she cannot hide her disdain for the Johnsons), and she's got that excessively breathy speech pattern down pat.|Fresh
"Yet another film about the Kennedy family may seem like an eye-rolling prospect, but Pablo Larrain's ""Jackie"" is so painfully alive, so painstakingly intimate, it rises above such simple descriptions."|Fresh
Powerful and profoundly spectacular. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
To watch Portman's every move is to not only watch history being recreated, but to also witness history being made. No one will ever be able to touch this role again. Or, at least, no one should.|Fresh
A Slaughterhouse-Five adaptation starring the former First Lady. I'm pretty sure most people are going to hate it.|Fresh
Portman's performance carries the day.|Fresh
Natalie Portman is flawless as a string of pearls, and Peter Sarsgaard lends valuable support underplaying Robert Kennedy, but the ghoulishness of reenacting the assassination for the millionth time overwhelms the film's pretended merits.|Fresh
At the core of it all is Natalie Portman's masterful performance of a strong, tightly-reined personality, seen in almost painful, constant close-up.|Fresh
The film is wise in the way it sees Jackie as a constructor of narratives, and it's tragic in its recognition that those narratives have little to do with her.|Fresh
What emerges is more serious docudrama: a fully rendered vision of a woman ill-served by most previous accounts, featuring an Oscar-worthy lead performance by Portman. It's also one of the year's best movies.|Fresh
Instead of devolving into a Warholian pop artifact, the prescient Jackie offers a raw blast of electoral catharsis.|Fresh
An iconic performance packaged in a film good enough to support it.|Fresh
"""Jackie"" would have been an exceptionally smart, intriguing movie as an astutely conceived, well-crafted meditation on political mythmaking. In Larraín and Portman's hands, it becomes something deeper and more emotionally potent."|Fresh
"Even if it lacks full dimension, and a final imaginative leap past the biopic strictures, ""Jackie"" pulls you into its web, shot by shot, moment by moment - most of them Portman's."|Fresh
It's not a one-woman show but it's clearly Portman's film, and she makes the most of it, helping Larrain to answer the question: How are myths made?|Fresh
A carefully compiled dossier on the life of an ordinary woman in extraordinary times whose dignity and grace under pressure humbled the world at the time and influenced future generations without planning to.|Fresh
While the gorgeous and mesmerizingly subversive biopic itself is destined to be cult rather than classic, Portman's is a performance for the ages, and one that makes Jackie utterly irresistible.|Fresh
Dazed yet undaunted, grief-stricken but determined, genteel yet steely, Jackie is the role Natalie Portman was born to embody, swaddled in a brilliant skin of a score by Mica Levi.|Fresh
If the film is about grief, then the film must act as grief acts. Unmoored and aimless, Jackie acts like a bad dream.|Fresh
Jackie is a triumph of production design, period costuming and vintage cars and props, all captured by Stephane Fontaine's formal camera lens in a mix of sharply defining close-ups and scenes constructed of Kubrickian symmetry.|Fresh
Though Larraín sometimes fails entirely to convince on that emotional level... his talent and intelligence have never really been in question. And then there was Jackie.|Rotten
Unlike previous projects, this unique film zeroes in on a particular timeframe, in which the indelible legacies of both Jack and Jackie Kennedy first came to pass.|Fresh
It's the feel of the piece that's so unique.|Fresh
What is this movie trying to do? Simply dramatize everything that can go on inside a woman simultaneously marginalized and revered.|Fresh
What is the tension of the movie? Where is the drama? There's nothing at stake, no transformation to witness, just the weird spectacle of Portman's peculiar Jackie impersonation and the promise, hinted at throughout, that the assassination will be shown.|Rotten
There's no way around it. Natalie Portman is astonishing in a surprising and engrossing look at a Jackie Kennedy we only thought we knew.|Fresh
Portman's portrayal of Jackie is almost startlingly immersive, and the film is an invaluable glimpse into the mind and heart of a tragic figure.|Fresh
takes a topic that could so easily have become a one-dimensional hagiography or a cruelly biting hatchet job and turns it into a powerful study in loss and resolve|Fresh
Intense, complex film about assassination and aftermath.|Fresh
One of 2016's most interesting, adventurous, and just plain best films, the most thorough revivification of the biopic form in a good long while.|Fresh
"The scene of Jackie playing the original song ""Camelot"" while she drinks wine and floats through their White House rooms in a daze is as heartbreaking a sequence as any I've seen. For just these moments, Portman deserves an Oscar nom."|Fresh
"Portman's turn in ""Jackie"" may end up to be the defining one of her career, even though she's only thirty-five. The more the film moves along, the more convincing she becomes."|Fresh
"""Jackie"" transcends mimicry to achieve something greater - bringing the first lady's grief and resolve in the face of unspeakable loss to vivid life."|Fresh
The many nonlinear flashbacks in 'Jackie' made me feel like I was lost in a crazy time machine.|Rotten
Solemn and mesmerizing, propelling Natalie Portman into serious Oscar contention...|Fresh
Yikes, could they have gotten worse performances out of an outstanding cast? Portman plays Jackie as if she's a moron. Sarsgaard, Hurt, and Crudup are perfectly awful, but Laurence Olivier wouldn't have been any better given the lines they utter.|Rotten
If Portman's portrayal seems studied, that's because the woman herself was, and not since Black Swan has the actress been so in command of such a substantial role.|Fresh
[Larraín's] film deepens the general understanding of this person at this terrible time, while also keeping her truest and deepest thoughts exactly where they must be - out of our reach.|Fresh
It is well acted and informative, revealing a side of Jackie Kennedy that is relatively unknown.|Fresh
It's a revelation, a steady gaze into the early years in which the American presidency was a site for crafting an image not just for the history books, but for the cameras.|Fresh
Stéphane Fontaine...uses rigidly composed frames for the interview which anchors the film while operating more fluidly in flashbacks, a device which mirrors Jackie's carefully composed legend building against real life.|Fresh
[Portman] captures Jackie's mincing, tinkly speaking voice and brittle politesse, but some inner emotional core, even in Jackie's most resonant moments, as in the weeks after the assassination, is lacking.|Rotten
It's as beautiful as it is sorrowful, and as reassuring as it is disheartening.|Fresh
It's a stunning historical snapshot and nifty piece of filmmaking.|Fresh
One of the most barbed and breathless movies of the year ... grief and social pressure haunt [Portman's Jackie] like Freddy Krueger.|Fresh
Unfortunately, Portman's performance is the kind of boilerplate biopic mimicry that, while certainly attractive to Oscar voters, is the antithesis of the kind of critique she and Larraín are attempting.|Rotten
Every detail shines with significance.|Fresh
Natalie Portman is stunning as Jacqueline Kennedy in the aftermath of her husband's assassination. Chilean Director Pablo Larrain crafts a sublimely artistic and intimate portrayal of her struggle.|Fresh
A brilliant exploration of Jackie's role in creating the Kennedy mythos, though it also doesn't really ever question that mythos.|Fresh
Pablo Larraín's Jackie is an elegy to two slandered traits: self-consciousness and superficiality.|Fresh
There are two movies in Jackie. One of these movies is just OK. The other is exceptional. The first one keeps undermining the second.|Fresh
The movie devolves into a suffocating examination of its star as she unleashes a tsunami of acting-weeping, simpering, smoking and snapping-much of it captured in relentless, oppressive close-ups.|Rotten
Jackie is at its strongest not as a making-of-history biopic, but as a perceptive and aphoristic essay on history.|Fresh
We all know the Kennedy story by heart, but you'll still never look at Jackie the same way again.|Fresh
It's a very rare thing when a movie transcends so perfectly making the viewer feel something of what its tormented protagonist experienced.|Fresh
Jackie is not a feel-good movie; if you have any empathy in you, you'll feel sad at best and terrible at worst. It's meant to upset, and maybe motivate|Fresh
Vibrant and melancholic.|Fresh
"In some roles, Ms. Portman stiffens up and never seems to get out of her head; in ""Jackie"" this works as a character trait."|Fresh
A profoundly haunting and powerful film that examines grief in its most raw form. Natalie Portman is extraordinary.|Fresh
Although often gut-wrenching, the movie is supremely compassionate toward its subject. Yet Larrain and Oppenheim pull no punches when it comes to Jackie, who emerges as incredibly complex.|Fresh
There's a mesmeric intensity to Jackie that's unlike any biopic of its kind, marked by a deliberate effort to narrow the scope to one woman's actions and reactions over the course of a few fraught days.|Fresh
It's not a conventional biography, or even a historical drama. It's deeper and darker than that, and Portman bores down to the complex, most challenging parts of its core.|Fresh
The real question is what Jackie as a whole adds up to, and the returns are mixed.|Rotten
A potent cinematic provocation. Powered by a transfixing Portman as Jackie, Larrain's film - one of the year's best - is appropriately hard to pin down and impossible to forget.|Fresh
Portman is simply magnetic in the role, but it's a performance that works when in concert with all the other elements of the filmmaking... It's entirely of a piece; a perfect film because all of the details are perfect together.|Fresh
Moving but fitfully realized.|Fresh
He offers glimmers of what lies beneath the near-mythic, elegant exterior, but Larrain's take is more impressionistic than revelatory, more presumptuous than knowing.|Rotten
"""Jackie"" does more than a disservice - bordering on an insult - to its subject: It's so obtuse about the history of mores that it's the equivalent of showing Abraham Lincoln reading the Gettysburg Address off a teleprompter."|Rotten
Jackie is a remarkably composed, artful piece of storytelling about storytelling, as an examination of the gauzy reputation of the Kennedys and the darker myth-making involved.|Fresh
For all its disorienting intensity, emphasized by Mica Levi's keening and discordant score, Jackie operates at a chilly remove from the viewer.|Rotten
Larraín pieces together the fabric of Jackie's character with striking command and unmistakable purpose.|Fresh
"Ultimately ""Jackie"" isn't that different from ""Manchester by the Sea."" Both films deal with bottomless torment, but also with the way the death of a loved one brings headaches big and small."|Fresh
There are no shortage of stories about the Kennedy assassination, but this may be the first to show us the event through the eyes of the woman in the pink suit and hat. It's beautiful, and ugly, and long overdue.|Fresh
Both wildly stylized and feverishly intimate, a surreal collision of private and public selves played out simultaneously in the exclusive back rooms of power and on the world's biggest stage.|Fresh
Jackie is a hard movie to love, but its brittleness might be its most admirable quality.|Fresh
Director Pablo Larraín and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim have crafted a dazzling 99-minute drama.|Fresh
An ambitious but jumbled drama in which the central figure remains elusive. Portman's performance gets lost in the chaos.|Rotten
"Larraín told his producers he wouldn't do ""Jackie"" unless Natalie Portman agreed to take on the role, and her superb performance, utterly convincing without being anything like an impersonation, vindicates his determination."|Fresh
Natalie Portman falls back on excessive Acting 101 shtick that seems aimed for generating film awards rather than seriously trying to decipher the soul of a beloved figure.|Rotten
For Portman, this isn't so much the role of a lifetime as maybe the roles, plural: The notion of multiple Jackies affords her a range of personas ...|Fresh
Natalie Portman excels in this uncanny portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy's anguish and dignity following the murder of her husband.|Fresh
A searing, almost scary thrill ride through the psyche of one very determined woman ... a reminder that JFK's visage owns the half dollar because Jackie owned Americans' hearts.|Fresh
The opening frames of Jackie lead one to believe they're about to see a horror film. One wouldn't be far off.|Fresh
Pablo Larrain's Jackie, a work of probing intimacy and shattered stereotype, is an electrifyingly fractured portrait of the former First Lady.|Fresh
Gorgeous and emotional, Jackie is the kind of introspective film about American history that just doesn't come around very often.|Fresh
All those beautiful artificial vistas remind us that we are strangers here, that all we can do is watch; that the real Jackie, and her celebrated pain, are unknowable.|Fresh
Portman brings life to a complicated character, infusing it with a high level of consistent intensity and a sympathetic malaise that is beyond reproach.|Fresh
Pablo Larrain taps into a challenging and intriguing perspective on the traditional White House bio-pic.|Fresh
"Portman's been a committed, in-the-moment actress since she was a skinny kid running after ""Leon: The Professional"" but ""Jackie"" is an accomplishment on the Oscar-winning order of ""Black Swan."""|Fresh
The iconic first lady is given emotional complexity and rich understanding through a stirring and ambitious performance by Natalie Portman in director Pablo Larrain's powerful drama.|Fresh
Natalie Portman depicts the former First Lady not as an enigmatic glamour icon, but as a flesh-and-blood woman grieving her husband - as well the end of her fairy-tale Camelot life.|Fresh
A well-conceived intimate portrait of the widow First Lady, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy (Natalie Portman).|Fresh
Pablo Larraín's film bluntly hammers home the notion that history is framed by perception rather than reality.|Rotten
"I happen to find the result intrusive, presumptuous, and often absurd, but, for anyone who thinks that all formality is a front, and that the only point of a façade is that it should crack, ""Jackie"" delivers a gratifying thrill."|Rotten
A film that manages to circumvent the conventions of biopics and common historical films. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There is real grace, sorrow, and beauty to Jackie, and it is a rich and rewarding cinematic experience.|Fresh
A biographical film that tries to break the mold and play with the pieces, where Jackie's troubled face is the perfect complement of Larraín's aesthetic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Though the unconventional biopic does not often spring to life, Natalie Portman's awards-worthy performance must be seen.|Fresh
It is both the Oscar bait drama we thought it would be and yet fuller, richer due to Larrain's direction and Portman's vivid, unforgettable performance.|Fresh
When it comes to making films that work as much for the sake of artistic expression as for capturing a moment in history, there's little question Jackie might be one of the finest pieces of cinematic storytelling we see this year.|Fresh
Every scene is kind of perfectly-honed.|Fresh
Rarely has a picture about events 50 plus years in the past felt so immediate and bruising.|Fresh
"A biopic that breaks the barriers and conventions of the genre, Pablo Larrain's ""Jackie"" layers itself as a deeply felt drama masquerading as a new form horror venture."|Fresh
The film is fascinatingly moribund, more meditation than narrative, a sort of monument to a singular act of public and private mourning.|Fresh
Jackie [delivers] a way for Portman to give one of the best performances of her career, maybe her best performance.|Fresh
Natalie Portman gives a tour de force with her performance, that will possibly make her win another Oscar. Nevertheless, I believe that the movie suffers from the film festival hype. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Her elegance, pedigree, and fame made her seem the most remote of figures, but for just over 90 minutes, 'Jackie' seems to exist alongside her. It's an electrifying and unexpected piece of work.|Fresh
While it's certainly of interest, this predictably grim, grainy, gloomy movie only periodically splutters into life.|Rotten
Good enough to make Portman this year's best actress Oscar front-runner.|Fresh
Jackie is Natalie Portman's show, and she never wastes an opportunity to dazzle as JFK's glamorous grieving widow.|Fresh
It's unorthodox but good approach to telling her story.|Fresh
It's an intellectual experience rather than an emotional one, but the ideas in play are so heady they're enough to sweep you away on their own.|Fresh
Eclipsing her work in Black Swan, Portman flutters like a sail in a brisk wind. She is scattered, tense, wrecked and compellingly defiant in the face of those who would have her act a certain way.|Fresh
Natalie Portman is wondrously good in this part: surely her best and an Oscar contender.|Fresh
It's a singular vision from an uncompromising director that just so happens to be about one of the most famous women in American history.|Fresh
Instead of observing its historical subject from behind a glass case, Jackie offers a piercing portrait of a woman's psychological and emotional journey.|Fresh
Larraín doesn't see a hero or a victim in Jackie Kennedy but a person, and with the aid of Portman's astonishing performance, we feel like we come to some truths about her even if those truths aren't the pretty picture of Camelot.|Fresh
There is much to like about Jackie, from the pitch-perfect period detail to Noah Oppenheim's inspired script, but it's Portman's portrait of grief that will linger long after the credits roll.|Fresh
Extraordinary in its piercing intimacy and lacerating in its sorrow.|Fresh
It's a character study that projects its subject's inner turmoil onto the whole map of the movie. A final cliché: it's as if we're inside Jackie's head. It's a thrill to have Portman give us a tour.|Fresh
Jackie is Larrain's first foray into English-language film and his first attempt to tackle non-Chilean political issues. The result is supremely accomplished and fascinating.|Fresh
"""Devastatingly human."""|Fresh
An elegant, highly intelligent attempt to humanise a legend - while showing its subject's acute awareness of what it means to become a legend.|Fresh
A strange, refreshingly cynical, and unexpectedly cerebral account of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's actions in the immediate aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963.|Fresh
Chilean helmer Pablo Larraín makes an extraordinary English-lingo debut with this daring, many-leveled portrait of history's favorite First Lady.|Fresh
