Bragging rights at what cost|Rotten
From the very first second, Neil's story is brought to life in such a way that not only inspire you to be your best self, but will also educate you in a way you have perhaps never experienced before.|Fresh
Chazelle somehow tunes us in to not only the precarious trauma of mankind's first journey to the moon, but also the precarious trauma of mankind's shared journey through life.|Fresh
Handsome, technically astonishing awards contender.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle is master manipulator of cinema. He knows exactly what to do with a camera to make you feel like you are physically experiencing this film from the astronaut perspective directly from your set. It's cinematically beautiful|Rotten
While the film had some great thematic elements (specifically the moments in space), the same things that were felt toward the beginning and end of the film, did not span across the film's entirety.|Rotten
Where's the excitement? Man went to the moon. There should be excitement that runneth over. I don't even know if there was enough in the tank to get it started. This is a hard pass for me.|Rotten
Expect lucid space images and not fabricated spectacles, as well as emotions that feel humanely grounded and powerfully mature.|Fresh
It's as though Chazelle and his ringer cast had approached each scene, whether a space shot or a conversation around a dinner table, and polished it to a blinding shine.|Fresh
A mash of awe-inspiring technical wizardry and heartfelt soul gazing, presented by Chazelle with great skill.|Fresh
It is an effective - and affecting - immersive experience for those who wish to understand exactly what drives people like Elon Musk.|Fresh
Painted in shades of melancholy and shouted through silence, it's as much a space movie as it is a psychological drama about grief, and it's an extraordinary effort thanks to its chosen approach.|Fresh
In those sequences when Armstrong is heading for the stars, the approach is so immersive on a sensory level -- cacophonous sound design, juddering cinematography verging on the abstract -- that it almost compensates for the void at the film's core.|Rotten
By the end of First Man, it's unclear if Chazelle wants viewers to cheer on the achievement of walking on the moon - or just breathe a sigh of relief.|Fresh
First Man is an immersive experience, a technical marvel with a poignant payoff.|Fresh
Featuring outstanding performances from Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy, it's a beautifully-made film that includes remarkable work from all involved. Simply put, it's one of the best films of 2018, and should not be missed.|Fresh
"Did Ed White have it right when he said, ""If a civilization doesn't try to expand its horizons, it can never grow as a nation."" What was that about American prestige again?"|Fresh
If you enjoy a well-crafted and introspective true story about one of the greatest scientific achievements in history, see First Man.|Fresh
Chazelle's approach might keep emotions grounded longer than necessary, but First Man nevertheless takes flight when it matters most.|Fresh
Aside from a few glimpses of emotion at the death of his daughter, I never got any sense of feeling or personality from Neil Armstrong|Rotten
The cool special effects can't overcome the flat script and ultra-restrained acting. Neil Armstrong may not have been brimming with charisma, but the director and actor needed to reach deeper and find something human for the audience to connect to.|Rotten
Chazelle's biopic about Neil Armstrong is candid and humble. Award season fuel that lacks a certain ferocity to be considered an epic and worthy biography.|Fresh
"""What do Tony Soprano, Gary Cooper and Neil Armstrong have in common?""."|Fresh
The film has a surprising low-budget feel that's well-suited to Chazelle's style and doesn't stray far from his indie film roots.|Fresh

"""First Man"" is an astonishing triumph of ingenuity and dexterity - simply brilliant."|Fresh
First Man is an incredible film, ripe with Damien Chazelle's touch - reinforcing him as one of the best directors currently working.|Fresh
First Man's privileging of the forbidding reality of the space program points to a kind of anti-triumphant masochism, a belief that the destination is less important than the grueling misery of the journey.|Fresh
First Man is a film built from small steps and giant leaps ... and that's exactly as it should be.|Fresh
Chazelle allows us to feel the terror of space and right there is where the main attraction for the film is and it's a small step in his career, but is not far from being a giant leap for cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film is valuable, but at the same time it doesn't meet expectations. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The actress who was Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown and stars in the new Millennium... balances well with Gosling. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
First Man tells an exceptional story in an technically attractive and marvelous way without forgetting human dimension. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The care with the cinematography itself is praiseworthy and, above all, the excellent role of Justin Hurwitz's music. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The movie is well-directed. Chazelle makes smart choices with his actors and his shot choices. And yet, it does not feel as alive as I know Chazelle can manage.|Fresh
As when he made Whiplash and La La Land, Chazelle is interested in what compels some to reach for the stars ... perhaps even more in what it costs those who do.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling is good at just being low-key all the time. The emotion is internal, it's just the subtle looks on the face.|Fresh
'First Man' takes flight as a stellar history of the first man on the moon.|Fresh
The film weaponises boredom: Neil feels a certain dreariness in the years between missions, and so do we, and that is the whole of the movie.|Fresh
First Man is the most solid film in Chazelle's career in that it takes the least amount of risks. However, it's not hard to imagine Chazelle to be the successor of Spielberg and Nolan as a blockbuster auteur. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Chazelle delivers a round film that works within the prerogatives of several genres. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
As Chazelle peels back the layers of Neil's personality to expose his anguished headspace, the director simply has very little insight to share.|Rotten
First Man is a film filled with great intentions, but awful execution. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
It's this focus on the little moments that sets this apart from other space exploration films--the idea that behind all these historical events are real people, with lives and aspirations.|Fresh
First Man bears the familiar curse of the biopic-it somehow feels both overlong and unsatisfying-and never quite escapes the shadow of The Right Stuff.|Rotten
It's odd for such a film, one of a momentous historical moment, to end up as an artful poem with the spirit of Dylan Thomas.|Fresh
The movie is okay, but I wanted a lot from the film...I don't want to take away from what they did, but I just couldn't get into it.|Rotten
[D]irector Damien Chazelle sheds all pretense as he reteams with Ryan Gosling to explore Neil Armstrong, the man, not the legend, who took the infamous first step on the moon.|Fresh
With the visual veracity of a documentary, Damien Chazelle's superb chronicle of the Space Race that lead to the 1969 Moon landing is a sterling work that goes to extraordinary lengths highlighting the risks these crazy-brave men took.|Fresh
puts the audience in the spacecraft and on the moon for a thrilling experience.... also a reserved yet poignant character study|Fresh
Chazelle rarely lets us escape, We're trapped, trying to read the sky and the stars using only math and a ruler etched on a window|Fresh
With its effective combination of a moving personal story with a stunning human triumph, achieved through dedicated filmmaking, one could fairly and respectably call First Man a 'perfect' movie.|Fresh
Like the chill of space, the result can be a bit cold to the touch.|Fresh
Chazelle's direction is technically perfect and the cast is as magnificent as one might expect but the cold, detached approach to its subject keeps First Man from becoming the masterpiece it aspires to be.|Fresh
A visually impressive film, First Man is worthy of an outing to the theater to catch Chazelle and [cinematographer Linus] Sandgren's work on a big screen, though the slow pace will discourage some moviegoers.|Fresh
The film proves that Chazelle is a legitimate force to be reckoned with in any genre and provides some of the most breathtaking sequences in recent memory.|Fresh
The film is many things; magical, surprisingly intimate, remarkably suspenseful. But what it does best of all, and most importantly, is inspire pure awe.|Fresh
It's honestly hard to imagine any other actor of [Gosling's] generation so realistically embodying the restrained dialed-back countenance of men of this particular generation.|Fresh
The special effects depicting space travel in this movie are loud, violent and claustrophobic, making the dangers of space travel seem more personal.|Fresh
Nothing on the screen, or anywhere else, could ever hope to replicate the profound, transformative experience of walking on another world. But it is difficult to imagine that it could ever be captured more closely than here.|Fresh
In the new feature First Man, director Damien Chazelle aims to give a realistic, procedural account of Armstrong's journey, yet the poetry never happens. Chazelle's take is dour, deliberately unromantic.|Rotten
First Man starts grippingly but soon becomes crushingly orthodox, betraying Chazelle's tendency, as per his previous films, to want to over-literalise the moral of his stories|Rotten
Chazelle and Singer have created a grueling, prosaic, state-of-the-art docudrama (no imagination allowed) with the heart of a male weepie.|Rotten
It's a movie that can be frustrating because it's so close to being a masterpiece, but it's still a powerful, engaging film that focuses on the determination that finds humanity at its best.|Fresh
The realism is palpable and procedural, the detailed symphony of sound and image in perfect harmonious sequences, orchestrated with an engineer's exactitude while never feeling cold or distant.|Fresh
"The really standout performance is Claire Foy who makes ""the wife"" part into a pivotal role, a woman with inner fire, by turns put-upon, excited and exasperated by her husband... worth an afternoon or evening at the cinema."|Fresh
First Man is precise, patriotic, immersive, gorgeous, and flawed. Can people stop complaining about the flag now?|Fresh
Chazelle has upped the stakes in gravitas and ambition, while not quite reaching the heights of his previous collaboration with Ryan Gosling|Fresh
"Chazelle's story could have been drowned in technical details, but as he did with musical terminology in Whiplash (""Not quite my tempo""), he reveals just enough for things to move forward."|Fresh
"""First Man"" works splendidly, giving a sense of authenticity, not to mention uncertainty and excitement, to a story that feels as old as the moon itself."|Fresh
I left the IMAX theater with a splitting headache and took immediately to bed.|Rotten
A film that is both up close and personal and vast and expansive.|Fresh
Even the first man on the Moon experienced more suffering in this world than he ever wanted to talk about. Touching, carefully paced, visually stunning, simply beautiful.|Fresh
The film is a demanding but praiseworthy experience.|Fresh
More interested in knobs and dials than human emotion.|Rotten
In the end, despite its failures it turns out to be a trip that is worth taking and that will surely give you satisfaction if your expectations about a biopic are not so high. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Gosling is so darned dreamy.|Fresh
Director Damien Chazelle's emphasis on realism and Ryan Gosling's understated performance take us into a world of unimaginable danger; where families can be instantly torn apart and heroes can live on for eternity.|Fresh
Everyone was casted so well. The performances were really nuanced. Everyone was believable, and you really cared about these characters.|Fresh
The conscious criticism and de-romanticization of the story make this film one of the great events of the year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The movie could be recut and called 'Secondary Woman' and still work because [Foy's] role and performance are that exceptional.|Fresh
First Man is the first you-are-there, shaky-cam-doesn't-do-the-term-justice, pitch/yaw/gyrate-till-you-puke presentation of the NASA space program to say: Here's how tough astronauts are.|Fresh
Armstrong does give us something to hang our hearts on, in the end-this is a Hollywood movie, after all. But it's oh so hard. And the movie makes us feel it.|Fresh
First Man fulfills its mission as suspenseful thriller. That's partly because it's not simply a re-enactment of a familiar story. It's a visceral, bone-rattling ride-an experience designed with meticulous precision.|Fresh
First Man may be about American optimism, ingenuity and the courage of those early astronauts. But, as the film's final shot of Neil and Janet Armstrong shows, it's also about being human, which is why the trip to the moon mattered, then and now.|Fresh
Ultimately, the movie is proficient but unsatisfying -- we leave the theater feeling like we know less about Armstrong than we did going in.|Fresh
The vastness of ambition and of space itself highlight the intimacy between the characters in all their glory.|Fresh
It doesn't matter that we know how Armstrong's missions ended; the filmmaker's immersive approach renders them as chilling and riveting as anything in the fictional Gravity.|Fresh
Even with historical fact telling you otherwise, you will still find yourself wondering if the crew survives the blast-off.|Fresh
First Man is a towering, breath-taking cinematic achievement. Miss it at your peril.|Fresh
deserves kudos for bravery in tackling a difficult character and refusing to soft-sell his shortcomings or offer easy pabulum to the audience who might be looking for some superficial reinforcement of American greatness|Fresh
Story of NASA's quest to land a man on the moon and the reluctant hero who took that first historic step.|Fresh
Rather than giving us the usual wide vistas of space, Chazelle locks in close on faces to give us emotional impact. Personally I would have preferred the spectacle even if that approach has been common before.|Fresh
It's difficult for the story to always strike its high notes over a wide time-span, which makes the film pleasurable but inconsistent despite its sensitive approach.|Fresh
I'm a great admirer of the work and efforts of everyone involved in this film. I just don't think this is their finest moment-or 138 overly drawn out moments, to be exact.|Rotten
The cinematography gives you a taste of both confined spaces and the vastness of space in a very intimate way.|Fresh
The flight sequences capture Armstrong's point of view, trapped in a helmet, pretty much helpless while technicians fasten him in. Much of the flights are in the dark and then there are flashes of light, and sound.|Fresh
There were a thousand and one scenarios in which the Apollo mission ended in disaster. They found the one where it didn't. Boy, does Chazelle make you feel the weight of that other thousand.|Fresh
It just misses out on being out of this world, but it's still one hell of a ride.|Fresh
An intimate and pragmatic account from the perspective of a quiet and taciturn Armstrong. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
You feel every bump and vibration, are deafened by the noise, and generally marvel at the sheer brute power required for those surly bonds to be slipped.|Fresh
Josh Singer's screenplay doesn't hit you over the head with feels but instead it lingers.|Fresh
"...this is a human story, much more focused on the ""small step for man"" and less on the ""giant leap for mankind."""|Fresh
It is a spectacular feat in retelling history and the journey of getting to the moon. We learn of the men who paved that path, some by laying down their own lives to make it possible.|Fresh
This is a story that demands a big picture view of life, and Chazelle delivers.|Fresh
It is one of the most compelling portraits of 20th-century history in many years. And, in its best moments, it manages to capture the awe that landing on the moon should.|Fresh
First Man is an intimate and epic biopic fueled by strong performances from its cast, as well as masterful craftsmanship by Chazelle.|Fresh
"In the same way that a great war film puts you on the battlefield, this film puts you inside the cockpit, inside the spacesuit, and inside those tremulous, heartstopping moments before Armstrong made his famous ""leap for mankind."""|Fresh
...long, depressing, and black...never explains why he was chosen... the few shots of the moon (actually an Atlanta quarry) in IMAX are disappointing...|Rotten
A long, draining, almost painful film that commands admiration more than love.|Fresh
While Gosling plays everything close to his chest, it's Foy who invites us into the unfolding drama with her wonderfully empathetic performance.|Fresh
An intimate and breathtaking character study that reminds us exactly why we still love going to the movies.|Fresh
While Ryan Gosling gives an admirably restrained performance. Damien Chazelle's biopic is weighted down with measured astrophysical detail, audaciously delineating what the stakes really were.|Fresh
The truth is, 'First Man' is such a gem technically that it demands viewing on a big screen. Find it in IMAX if you can.|Fresh
First Man is no crowd pleaser but it's a very fine brain-buster; the kind of movie that audience apathy will consign to history, much like our once funded dreams to explore strange new worlds.|Fresh
What the two men [Gosling & Chazelle] have created is nearly a masterpiece and will remain one of the best films of 2018.|Fresh
On the back of the remarkable one-two jazz combo of Whiplash and La La Land, (Chazelle) has aimed for the heavens and scored a rare hat-trick.|Fresh
When it covers the air sequences the film excels, while on earth things become a bit drab.|Fresh
Bring your space helmet because you're going to need it in the rarefied air of a drama that shakes you physically almost as much as it does emotionally.|Fresh
Chazelle drained all of the emotion out of the film and replaced it with a barrage of close ups of Goslings face in a space helmet. What is left is a cold, mechanical movie that praises the space effort but dehumanizes the participants.|Rotten
First Man is a visually spectacular film that should be viewed on an IMAX screen; however, Chazelle fails to make an emotional contact with the audience.|Fresh
...this may be the performance for which he'll be remembered.|Fresh
[Director Damien Chazelle's framing style] is one of the elements that makes this picture so compelling and more than the average biopic of a historical figure.|Fresh
"Quote from the past, ""Behind every successful man there is a woman."" Claire Foy as Janet Armstrong, shines as she's written to portray strength, love, uncertainty, and fortitude."|Fresh
A solid, satisfactory follow-up by Damien Chazelle. A little shacky on the earthbound drama, but soars really high with everything related to reaching the Moon. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Unromantic... this movie is not treating them like heroes like you're supposed to... they come off as just guys. People.|Fresh
This movie haunted me.|Fresh
Chazelle is three for three...this is a movie you have to see in the theater for sure.|Fresh
An impressive feat, a giant accomplishment. See this movie in IMAX and the end will take your breath away.|Fresh
It has amazing performances, and it's technically very well presented. Unfortunately, I felt very detached from Neil Armstrong.|Fresh
It's a gripping human drama, even at 141 minutes, and amazingly builds real suspense and tension even though we all know full well what's going to happen.|Fresh
With First Man, Chazelle is firmly in the tradition of American filmmakers who celebrate American heroism of the past with cleverly and efficiently devised splendour...|Fresh
It's at its strongest when illuminating the wonders of rockets, modules, science and math.|Fresh
Gosling, usually at his best in more expressive roles, does credible work as the tightly wound Armstrong. Foy makes for an interesting change of pace from the acquiescent domestic goddess usually portrayed in films like this.|Fresh
An inspiring work. It celebrates the heroism and triumph of our country's astronauts in a way we haven't quite seen before.|Fresh
First Man is the opposite of triumphalist, but an absolute triumph from beginning to end.|Fresh
Director Damien Chazelle's First Man puts that phenomenally difficult, dangerous event in the context of the wonder, the terror, the tragedies and the triumph that go along with it.|Fresh
Part engineering procedural, part domestic drama, with a stunning, almost spiritual climax on the lunar surface.|Fresh
Importantly, the domestic drama rings true, lending the intricacies and careful calculations of the training and the eventual mission itself a crucial emotional backbone.|Fresh
First Man isn't the story of man's journey to the moon. It is the story of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon. And as such, it is less an historical dramatization than it is a biographical melodrama with plenty of sentimentality|Fresh
Chazelle's biopic is more interested in exploring Armstrong's fascinating character than he is in exploring the surface of the Moon, although he depicts the latter with striking visuals and compelling near-silence.|Fresh
"Chazelle's follow-up to ""La La Land"" is like its predecessor more than the sum of its parts - in this case, ta celebration of the ambition and unity of mankind built on a foundation of individual sacrifice, and in recovery from unimaginable loss."|Fresh
First Man struck me as a far more ambitious and worthier work than either Whiplash or La La Land, two of Chazelle's previous movies.|Fresh
This handsome, thoughtful film is no jingoistic or romanticised account.|Fresh
First Man is a marvelous spectacle and an astounding feat for Damien Chazelle. It celebrates the success of Apollo 11 but acknowledges the long and heartbreaking path that Neil took to get there.|Fresh
First Man realistically humanizes a genre notorious for fantasy. What a welcome change of pace.|Fresh
Manages to make space travel both incredibly awe inspiring and fear inducing... These scenes are technical marvels that also manage to keep the emotion and dialogue working in concert.|Fresh
The movie is so focused on Armstrong, it's as if cinematographer Linus Sandgren has him in a spotlight, peripheral action unfocussed at its edges|Fresh
Gosling's Armstrong is someone whose motivation wasn't country or bravery but escape from grief, though emotion rarely rises to the surface.|Rotten
The attention to detail is astounding as we see not some pristine science project, but an endeavor held together by hope and will.|Fresh
Mourning, grief, solitude... Gosling goes deeper into his incarnation of the charismatic mask: the Gary Cooper face that is still, sometimes stock-still, yet always a fraction of a hair from bleakest melancholy. Gosling's expression in a word: bereft.|Fresh
A thrilling, surprising and sometimes deeply moving look at the person at the center of one of mankind's most widely-known and celebrated accomplishments.|Fresh
First Man is both a piece of human space exploration history and the personal story of a great, if taciturn, American hero. Well worth the time.|Fresh
From start to finish the moon landing segment is arguably the most sensational bit of filmmaking I've had the pleasure of witnessing in all of 2018.|Fresh
Yields at least two spectacular scenes... The rest is a little more uneven.|Rotten
With so much to process, First Man fragments into a loose stream of dramatic particles that orbit around the central star, Ryan Gosling.|Fresh
It's a movie where the technique matches the ambition, one that moves from tragedy to grandeur to personal drama without becoming bombastic or even worse, falsely patriotic.|Fresh
"It's a shame the story in ""First Man,"" which on paper should be effective, is overshadowed by the film's colder aspects."|Rotten
The movie, with its apathetic whimper of a final scene reunion between Neil and Janet, is both grandiose and underwhelming. I left First Man less certain than ever about the actual practical worth of the U.S.'s moon landing.|Rotten
Neil Armstrong and the men of the space program truly were heroic; not just in their bravery, but in their persistence. When First Man sticks to these ideas, it's stirring and engrossing.|Fresh
Chazelle beautifully sums up the gulf that now separates Armstrong from his wife when they meet for the first time after the mission.|Fresh
Intimate, serious drama about reluctant space hero.|Fresh
First Manis one of this year's must-see movies: a quietly profound drama that pays tribute to one of America's all-time greatest achievements.|Fresh
The result is a film that replaces humanity with a cold nothingness, and unfortunately nothing fills that vacuum.|Rotten
IMAX's superior technical possibilities are often used for spectacle, and that's fine. But Chazelle has done something more important with the large format: He's made a thematic point.|Fresh
A celebration like the arrival of man on the Moon, narrated with the seriousness of a sad event. A film about the conquest, based on the irremediable trance of death. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Spectacular ride with Gosling's stoic Neil Armstrong although shaky cam domestic scenes detract from impact.|Fresh
Chazelle brings the movie a keen eye for immersive action, including a multitude of point-of-view shots and other techniques that aim to put the audience squarely into Armstrong's perspective.|Fresh
It's about ordinary Americans reaching for the seemingly impossible-and, despite the human costs, scoring astonishing achievements in rocket ships crammed with spinning dials, levers, equipment that doesn't always work.|Fresh
Neil Armstrong left his family behind and traveled over 200,000 miles for work, and First Man understands what that says about him.|Fresh
Every time you expect director Damien Chazelle to zig ... he zags. That yields a biopic as unconventional as it is mesmerizing.|Fresh
... Reminds us that some things are bigger than what drives us apart.|Fresh
The cinematic equivalent to a professor giving a creative art student a history assignment when you know good and well that he's better off doing art.|Rotten
First Man's grimness . . . is the product of uncertainty about what America means today and who has a place in it. It switches out exuberance for glum dedication to training and expertise, presenting a Neil Armstrong for today's winner-take-all economy.|Rotten
Despite the setting, the justly lauded director is after much finer-ground powder: The emotional consciousness and motivation of a man whose countenance might as well be a lunar surface for all he lets out.|Fresh
A ruthless edit could have trimmed away some of the ancillary material and reshaped First Man into a leaner, more economical story.|Rotten
There's no question Chazelle is good at what he does, but he might be too good at fulfilling his vision in this case as First Man feels much more like an uncaged yet unnecessary virtual reality ride.|Fresh
"""First Man"" has a way of putting the audience in the cockpit with Armstrong, bringing to life the terrifying creaking reality of these pioneering flights in a way that is both claustrophobic and visually spectacular."|Fresh
The most special thing about this story is that it is not science fiction, it was real, it happened, and it asks us to dream again.|Fresh
It's rousing, riveting, and aside from a few lapses into melodramatic territory, First Man captivates by framing such accomplishments with restraint and realism.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling is exceptionally restrained in a performance that, if all you know about Armstrong is that he was notoriously private (but not reclusive), will convince you of his conviction.|Fresh
Just as the moon landing was a spectacular feat for humankind, First Man is an achievement in film when it comes to the cinematography/sound design of the space sequences.|Fresh
"Simply put, ""First Man"" is a great film and one that deserves to be experienced on the big screen."|Fresh
It's visceral, it's stomach-wrenching, it's brutal and frankly it feels like hell.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle has done it again with First Man. The period piece is a bit of a challenge, but this is bound to be one of the top movies of 2018.|Fresh
Everything about the story and presentation is big, so it's a bit disappointing that it all comes off a bit lifeless.|Rotten
A slow, meditative look at America's great space program ... First Man is long on family drama and short on action, but this is not always a bad thing, except when it is.|Fresh
This dour, unpleasant film wallows in a masochistic self-abnegation similar to the director's 2014 music school psychodrama 'Whiplash,' except banging on astrophysics instead of drums.|Rotten
Gosling is a virtuoso of the empty gaze - the ability to become lost in the middle distance as the camera settles in for an extended closeup of his sighing eyes.|Rotten
Even if First Man doesn't fire on all cylinders, its unusual protagonist is fascinating in his blankness; here, the right stuff is downright cold-blooded.|Fresh
At three films old now - everyone has decided (incorrectly but conveniently) that he made his debut with Whiplash - director Damien Chazelle's obsession with obsession is taking shape.|Fresh
Chazelle's ambivalent portrait of Armstrong is a strength. I'm not looking for movies to further mythologize heroes; I need real heroes - imperfect people of action.|Fresh
"""First Man"" respects the technical achievements and the breathtaking scope of the vision of the space race, but always keeps it real and personal."|Fresh
First Man hardly come close to capturing the overwhelming triumph behind Neil Armstrong's lunar explorations, though the journey to get there is technologically masterful.|Fresh
The brevity and heartbeat of the film is left to Claire Foy as Janet, his wife. She is superb.|Fresh
Have an out-of-this-world experience with this brilliantly ambitious biopic of history-making astronaut, Neil Armstrong.|Fresh
There's much to appreciate about the way Chazelle and his core team magnify the journey of a man who finds solace in telescopic emotions.|Fresh
Sound in the film matters just as much when it's absent as when it's present, and the silent awe of the climax is the stuff big screens are made for.|Fresh
The reticence of Gosling's character, his emotional constipation, is as much a measure of his virtue as a hero as his shortcomings as a husband and father.|Fresh
A movie that's as fascinated by the remote inner landscape of its hero as he is by the unexplored surface of the moon.|Fresh
Chazelle more than compensates with moments of sublime beauty, both earthbound and in space. Flying in the face of cinematographic conventions, he shoots much of the X-15 footage and all of the Gemini 8 launch from within the craft.|Fresh
First Man helps audiences appreciate the wild ride of lunar exploration, but also the awe and wonder of it all.|Fresh
This is not a flattering picture of Armstrong as the explorer hero. Instead, the film gives us a more authentic depiction of the ... challenges that Armstrong endured...|Fresh
When the Eagle finally lands on the moon in First Man, the picture truly soars.|Fresh
Technically, there is no faulting First Man ... Dramatically, however, things are a different story.|Fresh
First Man makes gripping and moving viewing.|Fresh
Whereas Hansen's exhaustively researched book sometimes comes up short on drama, this movie is fortunate to have a filmmaker who can dazzle as well as anyone.|Fresh
An ambitious if uneven attempt to do justice to both an American space triumph and the complex man at the center of it.|Fresh
A welcome counterpoint to all the buzzcuts and bravado, Claire Foy turns in an incandescent performance as Armstrong's devoted wife Janet.|Fresh
It ejects typical mythologizing to remind us that this extraordinary millennial-defining moment happened to an individual, a person just like you and me.|Fresh
It's a fascinating contrast of forms-a physically overwhelming, tension-filled film surrounding a quiet, withdrawn performance. It is both an act of faithful restraint -and an unusual risk.|Fresh
What makes the movie so memorable, so good, so strong, is the unvarnished, warts-and-all perspective.|Fresh
Projected on a towering IMAX screen, the docudrama's aggressive use of close-ups creates a suffocating and scorching effect.|Fresh
Chazelle has created an instant classic with First Man, intimate and epic in equal measure, a stirring and inspirational ode to one of humanity's greatest achievements. It will linger with you long after the credits roll.|Fresh
Being in the cockpit during the space expedition is a revelation, but it's too bad First Man offers so few insights into the man behind this historic achievement.|Rotten
First Man isn't a session of hero worship, but it does help one understand the otherness of Neil Armstrong, the seeming nervelessness that still exemplifies bravery in this age of scoundrels.|Fresh
First Man,... is a worthy successor not only to Chazelle's Whiplash and La La Land, but to the astronaut films that precede it, like Apollo 13 and especially The Right Stuff.|Fresh
Everything in First Man leads up to the climactic moonwalk where Armstrong takes that leap for mankind on a chilling, desolate, pockmarked landscape, a sequence encased in throat-gripping silence.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling and director Damien Chazelle strike movie gold again as they depart La La Land for outer space.|Fresh
First Man has trouble balancing the toll it takes on astronauts with everything else and where there should be emotion, a sense of urgency, and some sense of pride, there is an emptiness.|Rotten
Some films stay with you for eternity. This one transports you to the moon and back and is as special and introspective as the man it intricately studies but rarely reveres.|Fresh
Running at over two hours and 20 minutes, this earnest, dour, Oscar-needy film left me earthbound.|Rotten
[Chazelle] largely avoids the sweeping sci-fi vistas we're used to seeing... choosing instead to keep his camera tightly trained on Gosling to launch us ever deeper into Armstrong's headspace.|Fresh
His vision is raw and visceral, often putting you in the moon boots of the lead, but never quite putting you inside his head.|Fresh
While First Man is a stunningly-shot, beautiful, and thrilling piece of work, it more often than not feels cold and detached, preventing you from fully engaging with it.|Fresh
It's a contemplative, melancholy, moving film, but it also packs you into the cockpit for some of the most bone-jangling shaky-cam action you ever saw.|Fresh
The movie quotes JFK as saying the United States chooses to go to the moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard - First Man show us just how hard.|Fresh
Using every modern tool at its disposal, First Man has again presented just how harrowing that frontier was at the time, in the process planting its flag among the year's best movies.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle's First Man is everything a good biographical drama should be, and absolutely nothing that one would expect.|Fresh
It can be a little jarring that Armstrong does come off at times like a passenger in his own story, but in a way that also makes sense when you consider the enormity of his mission.|Fresh
Chazelle never glosses over the immense danger; instead, it's ubiquitous.|Fresh
There are moments of awe, admittedly, and you will wonder afresh at such a magnificent achievement, but it still becomes a chronological plod.|Rotten
"There is a moment when I literally couldn't breathe while watching ""First Man."" The module has landed and the first steps on the lunar surface are in progress. For a moment, the film transports you there. It's awe-inspiring."|Fresh
Played with introspective intensity by Ryan Gosling, Armstrong is obsessive, stubborn and would consider the adjective 'boring' a compliment.|Fresh
"Director Damien Chazelle, who took the mentor-pupil drama and the romantic musical to new places in ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land,"" here offers a striking, intimate and visceral astronaut story."|Fresh
Even when First Man stumbles as historical psychodrama, it still represents a giant leap forward for movies about the physical and emotional experience of flight.|Fresh
First Man is a giant, powerfully, epic and perfect leap...and Damien Chazelle's best film.|Fresh
"Intimate look at space race propels ""First Man."""|Fresh
"""First Man"" is intense, with visceral highs and emotional lows, and it pushes the helmer out of his comfort zone, resulting the best feature he's made to date."|Fresh
Chazelle has directed a story of pain, sacrifice and, ultimately, triumph, that will resonate with audiences.|Fresh
It celebrates humanity by focusing intensely on it, in all its glories and failings.|Fresh
A deeply engaging, intoxicatingly tense, and superbly thrilling piece of cinema featuring several breathtaking sequences which will linger long in your mind.|Fresh
The drama of the real-life history overcomes the weakness of the lead character.|Fresh
A historical film in which the historical element is so grossly distorted as to detach the hero from humanity.|Rotten
FIRST MAN does a first-rate job of re-creating the unbearable tension and excitement of the first landing on the moon.|Fresh
The film is a superb re-creation of the moon landing and all the facets of the project. FIRST MAN is a highly ambitious and fascinating effort.|Fresh
Once Chazelle throws us into orbit, First Man plays the moon landing so matter of factly, that it makes films like Apollo 13 look childish.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Armstrong captures the all-business, single-mindedness of the man, as well as his emotional impassiveness. ... And while this may be an accurate portrait ... it does not afford the audience the opportunity to fully embrace him.|Fresh
In a word: Flawless. First Man is a stunning film where everything works in symphony.|Fresh
...both admires and interrogates individual exceptionalism.|Fresh
It's a movie that shows how the most personal moments can coexist within and alongside the most momentous events. It's a film that insists history is made from private lives.|Fresh
"""First Man"" is the best kind of movie. It shows us that real strength comes not from winning but from failing - and that our lives will be judged not by our triumphs but by how we pick ourselves up after tragedy."|Fresh
It gets almost everything right, but it's also strangely underwhelming.|Fresh
Unmissable and unforgettable.|Fresh
Like the best cinematic space odysseys that have come before, First Man brings with it a message of humanism and mortality that puts life into perspective. What better backdrop to experience an existential awakening than soaring across the cosmos?|Fresh
Even when Chazelle's not using literal point-of-view shots, he still favors close-ups and elevates the sounds of ragged or labored breathing. Before First Man is a narrative film, it is an essentially experiential one.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle, Ryan Gosling, and Justin Hurwitz are quickly making their case as the modern-day holy trinity of filmmaking; they have once again funneled their outstanding efforts to grippingly juxtapose sacrifice with ambition|Fresh
First Man is a pretty singular, thoroughly enjoyable and compelling experience.|Fresh
A remarkable feat only a great actor can pull off.|Fresh
This is a stunning technical achievement, inside of which exists a really compelling and profoundly impactful personal story.|Fresh
First Man is an intimate portrayal of an American icon. It is a candid, searingly honest look at a stoic hero; and the stalwart wife who bravely supported him.|Fresh
A great idea in search of a film to match.|Rotten
"Ultimately more about the ""man"" than the ""first.""... Above all, it's the story of a fragile human being who was never the same after a defining tragedy -- who loved his daughter to the moon and back."|Fresh
[It] is a love letter to the scope of human ambition, but is also conscious of its limits. Josh Singer's script doesn't gloss over the more controversial aspects of the space program, nor its detractors, whose concerns -- are given fair consideration.|Fresh
First Man is more concerned with the space between Neil Armstrong's ears than the dark matter that lay between him and the moon. But for those who favor films that portray real people realistically, this one shoots for the stars.|Fresh
The greatest heroes in history are the ones who didn't set out to become one. That is the American spirit, and crystallizing that in a movie is about as patriotic as a film can get.|Fresh
It might just be the small caliber epic needed to better understand what it means to sacrifice for one's country.|Fresh
Really enjoyable! It was a dramatic peek behind the legend.|Fresh
There's more interesting and dramatic material orbiting Neil Armstrong. But those characters remain on the margins while Chazelle (as he did in Whiplash and La La Land) privileges the story of a single-minded white male reaching for the stars.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle proves once again that he is one of the most talented young filmmakers in the business. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
First Man is not a bad film. But didn't The Right Stuff do a similar demythologisation job long ago?|Fresh
First Man is about Armstrong's landmark achievement, but it's just as much about a country's grinding, maniacal fixation on getting him there.|Fresh
First Man isn't the giant leap for mankind. It's Armstrong's one small step, and it's all the better for it.|Fresh
It's a puzzle how a film with so many admirable parts can, for me, not come together.|Rotten
It feels as though there's been a tonal misstep; someone didn't read the room properly. We don't need apolitical platitudes.|Rotten
An American enigma brought thrillingly and poetically to life|Fresh
This is a fantastic film, with stunning work all around. Chazelle once again displays flawless filmmaking skills, while Gosling has rarely been better.|Fresh
One of mankind's greatest achievements unfolds with dazzling special effects that overshadow a disengaging story.|Fresh
Unlike the popular space race films that have come before it, not a millisecond of First Man feels like typical hero worship.|Fresh
For those who can get past the shaky-cam aspect that infects the cinematography, this is an involving look back in time at one of the most significant human endeavors of the last century.|Fresh
Damian Chazelle finds a dreamlike reverie amidst rocket-powered mechanical brawn. As wonderfully, nerve-wrackingly exhausting as it is movingly intimate.|Fresh
This is a dazzling, passionate journey of the human spirit catapulting itself into the vastness of the universe, searching for that connection between us all. First Man is first rate.|Fresh
For better and for worse, First Man feels like a close cousin to Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, another film that masterfully reproduced the sights and sounds of a world-shaking event. The people involved, though, don't come quite as vividly to life.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle and Ryan Gosling reteam after 'La La Land' and create a very different but equally thrilling work in this highly impressive story of Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 moon shot.|Fresh
While it celebrates the struggle and technological marvel that was Apollo 11 without resorting to empty histrionics, it's also a well-wrought character study of a man whose tight-lipped demeanor belied the emotional turmoil roiling beneath the surface.|Fresh
By focusing on Armstrong's human perspective, First Man gives us a new window into the costs and benefits of taking 'one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.'|Fresh
It gets the job done, with professionalism, immersive authenticity and unadorned feeling, of which Armstrong himself might just have approved, however apprehensively.|Fresh
In the end, what shines through First Man is the toughness and resilience of the men whose no-nonsense efforts allowed the rest of us to dream.|Fresh
Maybe not the rah-rah, American-pie space-race victory lap you're expecting, but still a masterful, monumentally introspective moon-movie character study in a class all its all own.|Fresh
Chazelle and Gosling deliberately go for something more grounded in its authenticity, but because of that, they end up with a movie that isn't nearly as entertaining.|Fresh
A complete triumph, full of cinematic wonder.|Fresh
Thanks to the abundance of space movies, Chazelle isn't left with many new things to say, but he does find new ways to say them.|Fresh
First Man is an admirable and engrossing attempt to understand the motivation and mental processes of the star voyager who took that one small step.|Fresh
It captures a decent and admirable moment in all of mankind's history with restraint, and, just when you want it, bombast.|Fresh
First Man is why we go to the movies.|Fresh
Director Damien Chazelle has taken one of humankind's greatest adventures and turned it into an intimate character portrait. It's engaging and emotional, but just the slightest bit underwhelming.|Fresh
At the tender age of 33 years old, Oscar golden boy Damien Chazelle decided it was time to make his stodgy, pedestrian Clint Eastwood-in-twilight biopic.|Rotten
"""First Man"" is a most intimate epic about a most private man."|Fresh
Damien Chazelle directed Whiplash and La La Land, but this is his most mature meditation about men and emotions.|Fresh
I'm glad Chazelle's film offers some fresh points of view on its subject; it's proof he'll be able to keep his filmmaking wits about him, no matter what genre he's exploring.|Fresh
Here, you can see that Damien Chazelle has everything under control. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A fitting tribute to an American icon best remembered as a humble, vulnerable soul with human frailties.|Fresh
A sweeping biographical drama of Armstrong's decade-long march to the moon, test by grueling test, told without romance from the pilot's-eye view.|Fresh
... a scattershot examination on loneliness and American exceptionalism that can sometimes be thoughtful, sometimes dull, but mostly feels hollow.|Rotten
Flouting the conventions of the biopic and man-with-a-mission movies Chazelle gives us an intimate, moving character drama with raw, visceral space-peril thrills.|Fresh
Foy is key to Gosling's performance working and a linchpin for the movie's overall success.|Fresh
Skillful and compelling...|Fresh
Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast ... but it's the film's impeccable balance of visceral heroics and tender family drama that makes First Man one of the year's best films.|Fresh
It's beautifully shot. The use of handheld cameras by cinematographer Linus Sandgren creates an enaging, documentary-like feel.|Fresh
The performances by Gosling - in a difficult, interior role - and Foy are exemplary.|Fresh
Chazelle expertly balances the film's wondrous visuals (the effects are seamless) with the more pungent emotionality.|Fresh
First Man: a simple story told with tight execution. It's one small step towards a biopic not about a sporting legend, one giant leap for Hollywood...kind of.|Fresh
Though its bravely unorthodox visual style and skeletal storytelling structure are sure to divide viewers in months to come, First Man is still undoubtedly one of the best and most significant movie releases of 2018.|Fresh
...a down-to-earth and frequently nail-biting piece of cinema.|Fresh
A small-scale and intimate biopic about a key participant in one of the most large-scale scientific accomplishments of our age.|Fresh
Too muted to elicit the kind of glowing takes that play on social media. But let it grow in mind and it will leave its mark on you.|Fresh
Telling the movie through the eyes of Armstrong is a mission in itself; to paraphrase JFK, it's a choice to tell a story not because it is easy, but because it is hard.|Fresh
There's no excessive patriotism in Damien Chazelle's latest effort. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An intimate portrait of a reluctant hero.|Fresh
"Chazelle chooses to portray with such a realistic silence (""in space no one can hear you scream"", we could say) as metaphorical, as material as it is spiritual. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
For those familiar with the history of both the politics and the space program, it is a neat reminder, and highly relevant in an age which takes it for granted that man can make a film the credible replicates the moon landing...|Fresh
The film is evocative, spectacular and affecting. It's like being there... I sat on the edge of my seat throughout this superb film, thoroughly engaged, inspired and moved.|Fresh
While it depicts the eight-year lead up to the 1969 moon landing, it's equally about a certain type of American male: the strong and silent type, the reluctant hero.|Fresh
First Man is a thrilling, deeply emotional ride to the moon.|Fresh
Maybe twenty years ago, in the age of Titanic and Apollo 13, it would've been seen as groundbreaking. Nowadays, it's all a bit too stuffy and proper.|Rotten
There are points in history where everyone remembers where they were when it happened. This is one of them and Chazelle and his team do that moment justice. This is an event movie.|Fresh
The climactic lunar landing [beautifully depicts Armstrong's personal struggles]. The moment's hugeness ultimately tore it from [his] hands. Now it's finally been given back.|Fresh
First Man is a strange film to review because, on the one hand, I want to praise it for being a technical masterpiece but on the other, it lacks character development and emotion.|Rotten
Gosling's natural charm, often on display in comedies, is again underutilized in favor of a macho blankness, and Chazelle's style is just as uninspired and detached, to often distasteful and manipulative effect.|Rotten
It's all about perspective... less concerned with history of that mission's impact than with what it was like to be him... Ryan Gosling leans into that squareness, daring us to peer in to his up-tight close-ups and find the guy inside.|Fresh
First Man is as much a spectacle as it is an emotional experience, and in that way feels as old-fashioned as its protagonist.|Fresh
Fails to launch.|Rotten
First Man is a stunning cinematic achievement that celebrates one of humanity's biggest triumphs (and mourns the tragedies that happened leading up to it), yet it never loses sight of its personal and small-scale story about a man going to work.|Fresh
This is probably the most patriotic film in years.|Fresh
Armstrong's stoicism is treated as one facet of a complete, complicated human being, as opposed to the defining hallmark of a one-dimensional American hero.|Fresh
First Man is not the last word in space movies. But it is an original. even poetic account of astronaut Neil Armstrong's personal journey to stand on the lunar surface in 1969.|Fresh
First Man is a technically accomplished story of how far one man will go to avoid handling his emotions, dressed up as the story of mankind's mission to the moon.|Fresh
It's an epic, ambitious film, but it ends just shy of true greatness.|Fresh
Smart, incisive, remarkably pared-to-the bone and wary of easy epiphanies.|Fresh
Chazelle and Ryan Gosling follow the exuberance of La La Land with a project both bigger and smaller.|Fresh
"The film can be best summed up as ""bland"": with bland performances in a bland looking film, it is blandly entertaining, and blandly inspiring"|Rotten
Thrilling when it escapes the gravity of drab living rooms and offices, First Man does an admirable job of complexifying a well-told tale.|Fresh
A viceral, thrilling experience expertly directed and acted.|Fresh
The moon was hard-earned and so was this movie. It's a stupendous feat.|Fresh
Gosling's portrayal of the stoic Armstrong is so understated that it's hard to tell how much Armstrong realizes the weight of what he's saying.|Fresh
May be gorgeous to look at, butthe film fails to capture how awe-inspiringsomething as epic as a trip to the moonmust have been.|Rotten
...First Man is an intense ride and an IMAX screen should be considered required viewing.|Fresh
In summary, this movie is good, and its star power has Oscar potential.|Fresh
First Man provides an experience for the viewer that goes beyond just telling the story of Armstrong but seeing and feeling it through his perspective.|Fresh
Gosling and especially Foy are out of this world.|Fresh
Astonishing. The definitive take on a monumental moment in history - without ever losing sight of the man underneath the visor.|Fresh
Chazelle has made a grippingly nitty-gritty procedural that sees the space race as a window into Armstrong's unknowable mind, an inner space as mysterious as the outer one he blasts himself into.|Fresh
In making the story intimate, closely-focused, and human-oriented, Chazelle reminds us in First Man just what an amazing accomplishment walking on the moon was.|Fresh
"Whatever its missteps, ""First Man"" represents a principled attempt to reconsider what heroism looks and sounds like, to think beyond the reductive rah-rah parameters that have led so many to confuse jingoism with art."|Fresh
As Chazelle oscillates between documenting NASA's many missteps and peering behind the curtain of the Armstrongs' domestic lives, he conjures the type of cinematic high any filmgoer has been chasing since they first stepped inside a theatre.|Fresh
First Man doesn't just show us what it looks like to go to the moon. It considers how it must have felt to go to the moon.|Fresh
"It's not an astronaut movie in the vein of ""The Right Stuff"" or ""Apollo 13,"" where the Space Race missions are the main focus... its focus is the life of Neil Armstrong, and as the movie shows, he's a man driven by a ghost from his past."|Fresh
Damien Chazelle's Neil Armstrong biopic First Man features exciting sequences and wonderful performances from Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy. But this space adventure never really gets off the ground.|Fresh
The finale is of such magnitude, especially when juxtaposed by the chilled silence of space, that it really is akin to walking on the moon; it takes your breath away.|Fresh
An intimate epic which is as fascinated by the small steps as it is exhilarated by the giant leap.|Fresh
It runs long, with restlessness setting in during the midsection, but Chazelle handles the climax - the moon landing itself - with breathless, meticulous cinematic skill.|Fresh
Armstrong's trip becomes a means for emotional emancipation, a backdrop for an intimate, universal story about dealing with trauma.|Fresh
It's a special film that keeps you white-knuckled about the outcome of one of the most well-documented days in human history.|Fresh
All that gloom gradually smothers the film, with each shot of Armstrong staring, pained, at the moon (we get it; that's where he's going) further diluting the movie's pull.|Rotten
First Man is the first Damien Chazelle movie I've liked and there are times I liked it quite a lot.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle is clearly in awe of the collective efforts it took to propel Neil Armstrong to the moon, but he remains ambivalent about whether it was all ultimately worth such immense sacrifice.|Fresh
Technically marvelous, Damien Chazelle's poetic moon-landing saga intimately portrays the thorny headspace of quiet American hero Neil Armstrong.|Fresh
While I felt the film did struggle with the emotional aspects of the storyline, I really can't find a film that was so effective in its portrayal of the personal experience of hurdling on the end of a rocket into space.|Fresh
Chazelle and Gosling have achieved something remarkable with First Man, even if that first man is the last man we feel we truly know.|Fresh
A captivating and suspenseful thriller, which is given a powerful whoosh of added poignancy by the story of Armstrong's family life.|Fresh
This is a confident but pretty bland technical exercise... The overall result is an authentic, visually impressive viewing experience that doesn't quite land.|Rotten
This last, largely silent, section on the moon itself is rightly awe-inspiring -- but it takes the movie a long time to get up there.|Fresh
The film reconstitutes our taciturn hero as a man riven with grief after the death of his daughter...It's a bold move and seems to inform Gosling's every decision as an actor.|Fresh
And yet, as restrained as First Man is, this riveting, exhaustively researched and utterly believable film manages to shake you, take your breath away and even pull a few tears from your eyes.|Fresh
They can put a man on the moon, it seems, but they can't get him to express his feelings. This really is the emotional crux of First Man and the theme to which Chazelle and scriptwriter Josh Singer keep returning.|Fresh
This is a respectful movie, even a genuflecting one; there's never a moment when Chazelle fails to let you know he's doing important, valuable work. But that's the problem: The movie feels too fussed-over for such a low-key hero.|Rotten
This is a human story, remarkably well told.|Fresh
When Armstrong climbs into Gemini 8 and it blasts off into the heavens, we've never felt this claustrophobia or listened to the creaking of the metal or felt the thrust of the rockets quite this way before in a movie.|Fresh
It's a beautifully made film, with an impeccable lead performance from Ryan Gosling as the sober, sensitive astronaut. Yet it's also a film which takes elegant flight but stalls across its extended closing sequences.|Fresh
Chazelle tells Armstrong's story with certainty and verve.|Fresh
A movie so revelatory in its realism, so gritty in its physicality, that it becomes a drama of thrillingly hellbent danger and obsession.|Fresh
A powerful experience that will inspire renewed awe of what Armstrong and his ilk did. It may not be a giant leap for filmmaking, but it's another small step for this filmmaker.|Fresh
This sober, contemplative picture has emotional involvement, visceral tension, and yes, even suspense, in addition to stunning technical craft.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling might be the hero of First Man, but the star that shines brightest in these moments is Claire Foy, firing up like the rockets that threaten to take Armstrong away from his family for good.|Fresh
An immersive, immaculately crafted, often spectacular and satisfyingly old-fashioned epic that may well become the definitive moon-landing movie.|Fresh
In its tragic undertones, complex psychological edifice, and claustrophobic visuals, First Man stands out, in both content and form, as a remarkable, jaw-dropping departure from anything Chazelle has previously made.|Fresh
Wisely, Chazelle has opted to leave spectacle to the blockbusters and instead aims for awe - which is related, but different, and harder to pull off.|Fresh
