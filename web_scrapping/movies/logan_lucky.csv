Logan Lucky is momentarily entertaining, but it is very quickly forgettable; a minor work from one of American cinema's most restless mainstream filmmakers that has such little impact, he might as well have remained in retirement.|Rotten
"Funny, creative, and the refreshing heist movie of its genre since ""Ant-Man"", ""Logan Lucky"" is an entertaining romp from beginning to end."|Fresh
Yes haw! Steven Soderbergh is back with an end of summer hayride of a film that will have you howling.|Fresh
Logan Lucky doesn't try to be something it's not and with its somewhat charming nature, it's a heist film that knows how to keep it light without losing its edge.|Fresh
This is that rare breed of subtle comedy that engages your heart, mind and funny bone, all at the same time.|Fresh
It's a heist movie, so we are still cheering for criminal behavior, but it is positively old-fashioned in its warm-hearted generosity toward its characters and by extension its viewers.|Fresh
Content to unfold seamlessly, indulging in the pleasures of listening to people banter. It moves forward at a gleeful pace, creating a slap-happy momentum reminiscent of the careening madness found in the best 1940s-era screwball comedies.|Fresh
This is just not as great as it could have been and it is so deeply frustrating given what a trailblazer Steven Soderbergh has been over the past 20 years.|Rotten
It's a guilty pleasure, but it's definitely a pleasure.|Fresh
As we get to know the characters, it becomes clear that something deeper is going on.|Fresh
Perhaps the biggest surprise comes from the fact that Soderbergh and his cast make the brothers sympathetic, rather than merely treating them with condescension. Tatum and Driver portray Jimmy and Clyde with an underlying sense of dignity.|Fresh
Soderbergh has made an indie movie the way he wanted to, on his terms, and the result shows the success of this method.|Fresh
There is no doubting that Logan Lucky has a big heart and tries its hardest to be endearing, but it falls a couple of rednecks short of a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert.|Rotten
With a quartet of committed and super-fun performances from Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough, and Daniel Craig, it's tough not to be incredibly thankful to have Steven Soderbergh back doing his thing.|Fresh
Logan Lucky shows Soderbergh operating modestly with optimum skill.|Fresh
The film has a comfortable shaggy feel, even as it unspools a fairly tight heist.|Fresh

"Logan Lucky is a rarity on multiple levels, just as remarkable as what the film comes to call ""the Hillbilly Heist."""|Fresh
The Logan family may have had a curse on them, but this winning outing from returning director Steven Soderbergh has lifted it; Logan Lucky is one madcap heist flick that ranks up there with the best of them.|Fresh
Steven Soderbergh's bracingly playful return to cinema is accorded a stunning transfer and little else, though the film itself is more than enough.|Fresh
The auteur who was smart enough to rethink the classic heist movie has returned with a turbocharged gasser, Logan Lucky, that once again puts him in the pole position.|Fresh
The film is a breezy, undemanding romp, a nice respite from what's in theaters now.|Fresh

Logan Lucky is intelligent comedy presented through absolute stupidity, and I feel lucky to have watched it.|Fresh
One of the most pure fun times I've had at the movies this year.|Fresh
Directed by Steven Soderberg, the film is intended as a backhander to the director's own Ocean's 11 trilogy, which were all glossy, hi-tech, largely unfunny and totally lacking in ideas. Logan Lucky certainly provides an entertaining counter punch.|Fresh
...  Logan Lucky  speeds and cruises like the freshest Ford Mustang. It shifts and drifts without any sign of choking.|Fresh
Logan Lucky is emblematic of the classic 1980s Hollywood blockbuster: it is great fun while it lasts, but you will forget it soon after.|Fresh
[Logan Lucky] is packed with deadpan humour, speedway action and a myriad twists.|Fresh
Stylish but shallow, this could be the director's next franchise, along with Eleven and Magic Mike.|Fresh
Nah...|Rotten
...the movie, despite its raft of appealing attributes, comes off as a forgettable caper that could (and should) have been so much better.|Rotten
If nothing else, see the film for Craig's portrayal of pure larcenous joy. It is a thing of beauty, as white hot as his livid blue eyes.|Fresh
Come for the zippy comedy about ordinary people mastering their own destinies. Stay for the entertaining filmmaking masterclass.|Fresh
A singular film-maker returns from a cinematic sabbatical in qualified triumph. We're lucky to have him.|Fresh
What could go wrong? Rather a lot and the most enjoyable parts of. Soderbergh's smartly written film involve the negotiations and shared worries of the amateurish but thoroughly lovable gang.|Fresh
He's made great movies in both categories, but with Logan Lucky, Soderbergh the studio-movie entertainer and Soderbergh the clinical, experimental stylist fully merge.|Fresh
Logan Lucky hums and purrs along like an Xfinity Ford Mustang, although, once the smoke clears, you may find yourself wondering if you've been watching a film about anything.|Fresh
Though the prison break and heist scenes are slickly and efficiently staged, the film's great strength is its good nature.|Fresh
"Clever, wildly entertaining West Virginia-set heist comedy-a terrific entertainment described as an ""Ocean's 7-Eleven"" inside the movie itself...warmly empathetic embrace of its economically dismissed characters... wears its kindly politics on its sleeve"|Fresh
It would be a fabulously funny and endlessly entertaining summer treat no matter who was making it - though it's hard to imagine anyone making it as well as Soderbergh.|Fresh
Here is a likable, sometimes uproarious, movie in which every actor comes up with something funny. We've got a lot of Southern gothics, but very few southern Ealing comedies.|Fresh
While it's overlong and sometimes disjointed, this heist flick delivers genuinely likable characters, winning performances and solid laughs.|Fresh
The charm of this film is not the heist, which is ridiculously complicated and improbable, but in its combination of quirky, often very funny, characters and the entirely earnest way the actors play these characters.|Fresh
"Steven Soderbergh returns to the big screen after a self-imposed ""retirement"" with a movie that's very much in the vein of his Ocean's trilogy but pulpier and quirkier -- and tons of fun."|Fresh
Fun enough and diverting enough while you're in the middle of it, but hints of something much richer and more satisfying dangle just out of its reach.|Fresh
Daniel Craig displays a gift for character comedy that suggests he'll have plenty of new and exciting avenues to explore in his post-Bond career.|Fresh
Wildly entertaining.|Fresh
Expertly made but strangely uninvolving.|Rotten
Steven Soderbergh returns from his self-imposed retirement with a hillbilly heist movie that has too many funny accents but not enough funny lines.|Rotten
Soderbergh directs with his trademark pace and panache, but to this he adds an obvious affection for his hapless hillbilly heroes.|Fresh
Steven Soderbergh ... is a steady hand when it comes to these convoluted crime capers and this pleasingly unspools to reveal a plot within a plot.|Fresh
Not the precision near-masterpiece that Out of Sight is, nor as tight or funny as the Ocean's films, but it's certainly got all the requisite qualities [of the genial heist movie] ... goes down smooth and easy ... the jokes raise a smile [not] a laugh.|Fresh
If this is the kind of eminently stylish and self-assured work that comes after taking a four-year hiatus from feature filmmaking, perhaps more directors should start looking into extended vacations as well.|Fresh
What a fun movie.|Fresh
Like in the Ocean films, Soderbergh's loaded A-list goes on and on.|Fresh
Logan's Lucky feels like a filmmaker re-indulging a passion. It's beautifully shot, as stylish as ever, impeccably acted and typically articulate.|Fresh
Logan Lucky feels like the work of a filmmaker with nothing to prove, neither sententious seriousness of purpose nor technical knowhow.|Fresh
A couple of clicks toward even more weirdness and Logan Lucky might have landed Soderbergh in Coen Brothers territory. Now that really would have been something to behold.|Fresh
All national and industry politics aside, Logan Lucky is a high-octane gas, a shaggy-dog story that's hard to outguess.|Fresh
"It's USP is that it's ""a red-necked Oceans"" or ""a hillbilly Oceans"" so, in other words, it's a riff on Oceans. Soderbergh directed the Ocean's franchise, so it is hardly a stretch for him. Or us, for that matter."|Rotten
Soderbergh... remains a talented filmmaker with an instinctive gift for pacing and style. Cinephiles can rejoice that his self-imposed retirement seems to be over, even if he doesn't push himself too hard in this modest return.|Fresh
Filled with colourful characters, crazy situations, clever camera shots and choice soundtrack cuts, Logan Lucky's beautifully layered plot features more twists and turns than a Nascar race (which admittedly isn't hard).|Fresh
Remember how panicked we all were when Soderbergh said he was retiring a few years back? Thank the film gods, there's always one last heist.|Fresh
With Logan Lucky, Soderbergh, one of our most inventive and unpredictable directors, just wants to have fun and bring the audience in on it. That's going to be all right with a lot of us.|Fresh
If the Ocean's Eleven movies left you with the urge to upgrade your wardrobe, Logan Lucky might inspire a day at the races.|Fresh
It's always supremely watchable, but rarely, if ever, commits itself to genuine jeopardy or suspense.|Fresh
We admire the cheek and chic of how it's done. We wonder quite why it was thought worth doing.|Fresh
The film's comedy is loose and generous, and its esprit de corps sneaks up on you with a soft tread.|Fresh
The ideal combination of grown-up concerns and childlike joy for big goofy movies.|Fresh
Logan Lucky builds to one of those impossibly complicated heists that only ever happen in movies and rather contradicts the notion that the Logans are stupid or cursed.|Fresh
Steven Soderbergh makes entertaining, well-crafted films. Logan Lucky is no different. If you're in the mood for a heist-comedy that looks fantastic, you're not going to go wrong.|Fresh
Daniel Craig steals the show.|Fresh
[Logan Lucky] is not going to win him any Oscars but Soderbergh certainly appears to have recovered his zest for filmmaking.|Fresh
Soderbergh, back from a self-inflicted hiatus, is the perfect man to bring this Rebecca Blunt screenplay to life, utilising his experience in this sub-genre to triumphant effect.|Fresh
A frolicsome rural crime thriller.|Fresh
The movie almost has enough assured touches and aromatic performances to make you overlook that the humour is generic at times and that the story suffers from not having a genuine antagonist to shake things up.|Fresh
Soderbergh's most entertaining film, since at all times on the screen you can tell that the cast is having a great time. This is contagious and compensates many times for the slow development of the plot. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
If a movie could strut, Logan Lucky would look like Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, so confident in its ability to impress and to please its audience with its entertaining heist hijinks.|Fresh

The heist is fun, but the detailed inside look at the workings of a speedway really makes Logan Lucky special.|Fresh
Soderbergh again proves his mastery at this sort of comic crime thriller.|Fresh
"We're talking at least 11, 12, 13, maybe 14 players involved in robbing the Charlotte Motor Speedway. (Not that the Rube Goldbergian plot -- with the accent on rube, of course -- bears any resemblance to any of Soderbergh's trio of ""Ocean's"" movies)."|Rotten
There are precious few characters who don't look and sound like they just got back from molesting Ned Beatty alongside the Georgia river. But the movie somewhat works thanks to a solid second half and some sharp performances.|Fresh
Steven Soderbergh's amusing, escapist, 'Oceans 7-Eleven' heist is a blast!|Fresh
A very funny heist film.|Fresh
This picture suggests a great director easing back into the feature-film game.|Fresh
Just as impressive as Logan Lucky's technical proficiency is its winning embrace of fun.|Fresh
The podunk milieu in which Logan Lucky is set feels overstated, like a New Yorker taking a selfie in front of a Stuckey's.|Rotten
Like its characters, the film has no airs about it, and simply exists to entertain viewers and it does that with plenty of aplomb and ease. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh

Logan Lucky is a fun and engaging caper movie directed by Steven Soderbergh.|Fresh
After four years away, it's far better to have too much of a Soderbergh movie than not enough.|Fresh
Craig manages to steal each scene he's in with his bleached hair, impeccable Southern accent and hair-trigger personality. An Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor is likely.|Fresh
It's rare that you can enter a film with full confidence that everyone involved knows what they're doing, and they're going to be excellent doing it. And in that way, Logan Lucky is the ultimate caper.|Fresh
Ocean's 7-Eleven, indeed. Amiable heist flick.|Fresh
LOGAN LUCKY is a delight, peppered throughout with clever set-ups and pay-offs beset only by an over-abundance of characters.|Fresh
"With a charmingly relatable cast of quirky losers...and a plot that unfolds like a Rube Goldberg construction, ""Logan Lucky"" is ideal summer entertainment."|Fresh
Trotting out a cast of high-caliber actors, all playing against type, Soderbergh spins a wily, joyous slice of Southern-fried outlaw adventure.|Fresh
Director Steven Soderbergh is back and firing on all cylinders in Logan Lucky, a Southern-fried heist comedy that is, like its main characters, smarter than it lets on.|Fresh
This movie does not aspire to greatness or significance; being extremely clever and thoroughly competent is the goal here.|Fresh
The best heist film in years.|Fresh
The script, the direction and the performances work in concert like a souped-up muscle car.|Fresh
"Soderbergh's ace-in-the-hole has to be the young Farrah Mackenzie. When she has her big scene, no parent could resist the tug at their heart-strings. More than a heist comedy, ""Logan Lucky"" is an endearing father-daughter love story."|Fresh
A star-studded heist flick that calls to mind some of the eclectic director's most popular work even if it falters a bit at the end.|Fresh
A slick, smarter-than-your-average-bear heist comedy that moves and grooves with all the hallmarks of a Soderbergh caper. He's back, baby.|Fresh
The story here is clean and the characters very charming, and it doesn't fall into the trap of being smugly pleased with itself by overcomplicating matters (ahem, Ocean's Twelve).|Fresh
'Logan Lucky' succeeds because Soderbergh shows not only respect for his characters, but reveals their hearts and souls. He gently pushes you to embrace them.|Fresh
Keough is a standout and Craig is a complete hoot.|Fresh
"Intelligent, fun and well executed, we could even say that the film works as a ""Ocean's Fourteen"". [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
When the plot stops cold for a beauty-pageant performance of exquisite purity, you'll feel like you're watching the most American film of the year.|Fresh
Didn't I read somewhere that Soderbergh had retired from filmmaking? This would be a perfect time for him to keep that promise.|Rotten
Logan Lucky is a crackerjack heist film that strongly echoes Soderbergh's other crackerjack heist franchise, but with a uniquely downmarket and genuinely affectionate charm all its own.|Fresh
Smart, clever and hilarious it is fun from start to finish line.|Fresh
It's a lark, if you can tolerate the hammy redneck accents, and confirms that Soderbergh is as agile as ever at knitting together all the moving parts of a complex heist.|Fresh
Steven Soderbergh, with his mysterious screenwriter Rebecca Blunt (reportedly the pseudonym of the director), and a great cast have fun in creating a twisty heist thriller with a sense of humor.|Fresh

[Soderbergh's] big-screen comeback, Logan Lucky, finds him taking the relatively easy option of the lighthearted heist movie, something he's always done well.|Fresh
The whole movie is a trick, reversing our expectations at nearly every turn and casting actors in roles that they were not exactly born to play, but do so with relish.|Fresh
Steven Soderbergh has returned from a four-year motion-picture retirement to once again show us that when it comes to crafting robberies of high stakes-even ones involving the lower classes-he remains the slickest of them all.|Fresh
"After four years of ""retirement"", Soderbergh shows that he is still in perfect shape. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh

An original breath of fresh air. It's an unexpected delight.|Fresh
While Logan Lucky gives off the impression of a shaggy character-based comedy, such an assessment shortchanges how deliriously clever it is.|Fresh

Soderbergh's return to features is a redneck riff on his Ocean's 11, a cool breeze of summertime sweetness that restores the good name of movie escapism. Daniel Craig is off-the-chain hilarious.|Fresh
Like the best of his movies, this heist film retains its essential shagginess despite the A-list stars headlining it, and it reminds us what a nifty flair the director has for light entertainment.|Fresh
As a hotly anticipated comeback, it feels like a slightly dippy, ultimately disposable warm-up of a director whose brains, chops and judicious taste we need more than ever.|Rotten
"""Logan Lucky"" is his down-home version of the ""Ocean's"" franchise, with NASCAR instead of the Bellagio, but it's every bit as cheeky, fun and funny."|Fresh
Essentially a red-state Ocean's Eleven - a fizzy, twisty Southern-fried heist flick that's more enjoyable the less you try to dissect it.|Fresh
Soderbergh rolls the dice with 'Logan Lucky' and comes up with a winner.|Fresh
Steven Soderberg's funny, underdog heist movie is a heartfelt paean to the kinds of Southern working-class whites normally caricatured as Confederate-flag-waving racists.|Fresh
The movie is smart and funny, though ultimately it's less noteworthy as an entertainment than as a marketing concept.|Fresh
The result is a breezy, slight, Southern-flavored movie where the cast appears to be having enough fun to prove mildly infectious.|Fresh
"The script's vibe recalls Soderbergh's arch, knowing ""Ocean's"" movies, but also evokes older pictures such as ""Bank Shot"" in the early '70s or ""Who's Minding the Mint?"" in the late '60s."|Fresh
But the best part of Logan Lucky is that from the get-go you know you're in confident hands, and whatever's about to happen, it's going to be great.|Fresh
A nice change of pace for Soderbergh, who, for the first time in a long time, seems genuinely interested in providing an entertaining ride.|Fresh
"Perhaps ""Logan Lucky"" is best appreciated as a stealth commentary on tough times in America. It takes a director of Soderbergh's gifts to actually make that funny."|Fresh
If it verges on being a little too pleased with itself for its own good, that's an acceptable price to pay for something that makes you smile.|Fresh
In the very least, Hal Needham's Smokey and the Bandit films displayed a fair amount of affection amid the hamming for their shit-kicking rubes.|Rotten
Heartfelt felicitations to [Steven] Soderbergh on his rebirth of the cool.|Fresh
Jimmy's team is like a blue-collar mirror image of the Ocean's crew. But there's more going on here than a story about a bunch of amateurs attempting a complicated robbery.|Fresh
A precision-tooled entertainment made by experts, and sometimes more than that. Watching it is like finding money in the pocket of a coat that you haven't worn in years.|Fresh
The glitz and glamour of the Ocean's trilogy is in a completely different area code than Logan Lucky, but Soderbergh's latest has the same terrific camaraderie and joy as those movies.|Fresh
I liked the movie - it's certainly well made, and a lot of fun - but I mostly found myself laughing at it, not with it.|Fresh
Logan Lucky reminded me most of Howard Hawks' El Dorado. It has the tossed-off, casual sophistication of an old master's late work.|Fresh

A high-spirited hillbilly-heist caper with a dynamite, all-star ensemble cast.|Fresh
It ... feels like the director is trying to reverse-engineer one of the Coen brothers' loopier excursions and not getting every one of the pieces in order. But he comes close.|Fresh
A slick, surprising summer entertainment from a terrific director who's having a helluva time just keeping everyone laughing, and guessing.|Fresh
The actors mostly lean hard on comical redneck accents, and the slow-moving plot features way too many leaps of logic.|Rotten

So warmheartedly enthusiastic, it's hard not to get swept away with this group of not-so-average Joes.|Fresh
Logan Lucky may be more of the same. But more of the same, from Soderbergh, is what more summer movies should aspire to be.|Fresh

Soderbergh is perhaps Hollywood's finest technician, and it's a pleasure to watch him tour his Vegas act through Appalachia.|Fresh
"There's no question that the film is full of gentle, good-natured mockery of the sort of knucklehead culture that we call ""redneck"" but it's all very sympathetic -- more so, even, than a Jeff Foxworthy You May Be a Redneck If (filll in the blank) routine."|Fresh
Some will write off Logan Lucky as one of Soderbergh's most frivolous efforts, but that would be a mistake.|Fresh
Logan Lucky is great fun and one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year.|Fresh
"Mr. Soderbergh revels in squareness, and in a loose self-confidence that disguises its mastery. ""Logan Lucky"" is a terrific movie."|Fresh
I think that's a big part of what makes Logan Lucky a very fun movie: You're lost, you're lost, you're lost -- and then it all makes so much sense that you feel like you should have known what was happening all along.|Fresh
Independently financed and distributed by Soderbergh, Logan Lucky is a magnificent movie that comes disguised as a modest one. Or, as I like to call it, a Joe Bang.|Fresh
An eccentric combo of scrappy crime caper and angular redneck comedy, Logan Lucky shouldn't work anywhere near well as it does.|Fresh
Soderbergh keeps the action light and playful, and lets the cast members find their own silliness within it.|Fresh
Southern flavor, rampant goofiness and fun twangs go a long way in making director Steven Soderbergh's cinematic return such a sparkling hoot.|Fresh
For a fast and funny crime flick, Logan Lucky has plenty of grunt under the hood.|Fresh
A fun and unpretentious romp that benefits from smart pacing, likeable characters and a stick-it-to-the-man undercurrent that helps keep things moving along.|Fresh
It's a genuine effort by talented people that never quite comes off.|Rotten
The whole thing comes together to form the best Burt Reynolds movie he never made.|Fresh
The endearing charm of the characters - along with a plot that teases the audience with just enough information to keep them wondering what's next - makes Logan Lucky a winner.|Fresh
Sometimes, the only reason for doing anything is to have a little fun, and Soderbergh seems to be having a lot of it.|Fresh
Steven Soderburgh's return to the big screen may look like an Ocean's reboot a la NASCAR, but don't you go thinking this is some smart alecky snobby spin.|Fresh
Having successfully pulled off three Danny Ocean cons, director Steven Soderbergh is looking for a new bank vault to plunder. Logan Lucky turns out to be a playfully subversive variation on the theme.|Fresh

Four years after his self-imposed retirement, maverick director Steven Soderbergh takes the easy way out. Or, rather, back in.|Rotten
Clunky, tin-eared caper comedy that drips with contempt for its own characters.|Rotten
"While even the film itself cites the heist as ""Ocean's 7-11"", it's got a flavor and energy all its own. It's a blast from start to finish."|Fresh
Logan Lucky is a hoot. It's the sort of movie that allows you to laugh, relax and let everything wash over you... Everything is laid back - from the characters to the humour - and the payoff is delicious.|Fresh
Logan Lucky is a hillbilly heist caper brimming with good natured humor.|Fresh
Soderbergh shows here that the melding of mainstream storytelling and artful execution is possible.|Fresh
Logan Lucky is easygoing entertainment that, on occasion, gently brushes up against its stiffer real-world framing. I'm not sure the film is as successful in doing that as Magic Mike is, but it still makes for an intriguingly toned film.|Fresh

The kind of small-scale, shaggy dog story Hollywood rarely makes these days.|Fresh
Logan Lucky is one country-fried hootenanny of a heist thriller that goes off with a (Joe) Bang.|Fresh
A purely auteur-driven lark slipped into an era when studios no longer want to work with directors with personality and pesky calls for final cut - a high entertainment with a handmade feel.|Fresh
Logan Lucky feels a lot like Oceans 14.|Fresh

Steven Soderbergh's Logan Lucky is a high-spirited, low-down blast.|Fresh
Channing Tatum, working with Soderbergh for the fourth time, is at his sympathetic and charismatic best in Logan Lucky.|Fresh
Even if it needed one last push to make it truly exceptional, there's a lot to enjoy here. And Soderbergh once again attracts a cast it's a pleasure to spend time with.|Fresh
This is a good-times film that doesn't put on airs, dress to impress or pretend to be something it isn't. It just aims to please and does a pretty good job of it.|Fresh
"This blue-collar ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smooth-running, pleasantly familiar crime caper. In a movie full of cons, the greatest may be how deceptively easy Steven Soderbergh makes the whole enterprise seem."|Fresh
As the film teeters the line between ridiculous and generic screwball, the all-star cast dazzles to hilarious effect.|Fresh
