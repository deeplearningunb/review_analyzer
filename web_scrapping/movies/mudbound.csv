This film destroyed me. It kicked me in the stomach, ripped out my guts, and stomped on them. Watch it. Watch it immediately.|Fresh
The film has an acute sense of place in its design and cinematography. It is in the editing that the film becomes choppy, not giving any one story or any one character the space to breathe.|Fresh
It's an American epic about two families in just a decade's time and yet it tells the story of a nation divided by hate and suffering.|Fresh
Mudbound takes an intimately epic novel and transforms it into an unsubtle, awards courting drama. The cast deliver uniformly great performances, but the film never delves as deep as I would have liked into the harsh social backdrop of the period.|Fresh
Screenwriter and Director, Dee Rees makes a brilliant decision to focus on sharecropping. It's a profession that's rarely represented on film.|Fresh
The hidden passions, rancid hatreds and thunderstorms make for a memorable movie about the wastefulness of prejudice and the value of friendship. It goes back into the past to tell us some important things here in the present.|Fresh

Rees effortlessly has created one of the most sweeping and epic films of the year, as rooted and gritty as its subjects.|Fresh
Mudbound is old-fashioned in the best sense. Its literary fidelity and historical heft offer an unsettling look at the past, while at the same time packing the visceral wallop of the present.|Fresh
It depends on one's perspective, but this stunning film, gorgeously directed and skillfully acted, challenged mine.|Fresh
New American classic Mudbound is a reminder of the brutality of American history, of the weight of generations of institutionalized bondage and familial racism, and of the possibility of love as survival.|Fresh
This film does a phenomenal job of reminding you that the more things change, the more they stay the same. One thing that has changed is Mary J. Blige, who has blossomed dramatically as an actress.|Fresh
Since Netflix produced Mudbound, many viewers will watch it on laptops, which is unfortunate because Rachel Morrison's cinematography is so carefully burnished.|Fresh
The direction of Rees, well supported by the lyrical photography of Rachel Morrison -nominated to the Oscar for this work-, is centered more on the story, on her half dozen characters and on how the actors interpret them. (Review in Spanish)|Fresh
The ensemble cast is extraordinary. Miss this film at your risk.|Fresh

Excluding director Barry Jenkins' extraordinary character drama Moonlight, this is the best American racial drama in some time- much better than Detroit and Hidden Figures.|Fresh
Dee Rees' film is a study of historic division, but it has such a poetically tragic sense of the characters and their limitations that it transcends the period setting.|Fresh
[Dee Rees'] created a historical epic about two Americas - people living side by side but utterly separated by experiences - that resonates in modern times.|Fresh
The entire cast is remarkable.|Fresh
Director-cowriter Dee Rees gives this 1940s drama such an epic scale that it might have played out better as a TV miniseries, with more time to flesh out the characters and complex situations. But the themes are so vivid that it still gets under the skin.|Fresh

Most resounding are the indelible characters created by a wonderful cast.|Fresh
This harrowing, intense, searing movie about two families bound together by land, war and poverty in rural Mississippi in the middle of the 20th Century is both foreign and familiar. Most of all, it is powerful.|Fresh

It's a disappointing end to an important if somewhat underambitious film, but it still succeeds in providing emotional resolution that reminds viewers why all this matters.|Fresh
Mudbound typifies a new kind of unpleasant entertainment based on social-justice homilies. . .But Mudbound becomes tiresome from its opening scene. . .[It] lacks the authenticity and justification of genuine folk art.|Rotten
Dee Rees created a remarkable piece of art that not only showcases a heartbreaking time in our history, but also causes you to question what pieces of this time still remain today.|Fresh
"Rees does have a vision for the effort, helping to carry ""Mudbound"" through patches of familiarity, coming through with capable take on prejudice and rural isolation."|Fresh
Exploring the resilient spirit and dark underbelly of the Jim Crow South, Dee Rees has created a new American classic.|Fresh
Mudbound is a quality film, but it doesn't have the vision or depth of the novel.|Fresh

Confronting race, class, war, and the possibility of unity, Mudbound spellbinding drama reckons with the past to understand the present.|Fresh
What really lifts the heaviness of Mudbound's story over the top is the excellence of its cast, starting with Mulligan, who plays Laura as a woman whose adaptability to farm life is more about survival instinct than enthusiasm.|Fresh
What this film says about race cannot be confined to one character or perspective. It seems to adhere to a novelistic approach, speaking through a collection of voices gleaned from two families' viewpoints in a larger diagram.|Fresh
Every movie about systemic racism is as much about white Americans as any other group and the ways in which they've benefited from institutional prejudice. Mudbound brings an additional layer of nuance to the conversation.|Fresh
Mudbound is a sprawling family drama and portrait of Americana that can-and should-stand next to classics like Giant.|Fresh
This beautifully composed film engrosses from the first frame to the last, breathtaking in its humanity and its ability to build out a fully realised world that never feels antiquated despite its 1940s period setting.|Fresh
Except in one instance, the story is not overtly sentimentalized. Rees has been well served in this by her excellent ensemble.|Fresh
A solid Southern story deserving of a far more epic canvas. Its oddly truncated shortcuts do not rob its memorable complexity and strong performances- suggesting seeds of positive change and productive compassion sometimes take root only fleetingly.|Fresh

There are many themes in Dee Rees' beautifully rendered film Mudbound, which debuted on Netflix on Friday. But there are none more prescient, more timely than the ones that parallel the America we currently inhabit.|Fresh
Its desire to address big American themes is well realised in the main plot, which credibly sets up a friendship between two war veterans.|Fresh
Mudbound is a daring approach to a classical narrative, a film that tries to look from multiple perspectives at an intimate human drama that has far-reaching ramifications.|Fresh
Deeply powerful and affecting, Mudbound refuses to shy away from asking some uncomfortable questions to which you might not like the answer.|Fresh
With great performances across the board and a socially relevant story, Mudbound will resonate long after the credits roll.|Fresh
The shifting voices help to create interiority without relying on inelegant exposition, and allow Rees to refract broad themes like love, war, and racism through very specific points of view.|Fresh
With broad cinematic landscapes and rich literary themes, it is most certainly something best consumed in a widescreen theatrical format. But if streaming opens it to a larger audience, then all the better. We need more cinema like this.|Fresh
It reads like a novel with its richness of characters, its palpable sense of place and its lacerating commentary on a nation where equality exists only on a dusty old document called the Declaration of Independence.|Fresh

"""Mudbound"" generates considerable emotion in the scenes between the two men, and Hedlund and Mitchell have a terrific natural rapport."|Fresh
Blige, the queen of hip-hop and soul, is virtually unrecognizable, but her underplaying in no way negates her force. It's a self-contained force that she possesses here, and she knows when to loosen the bonds.|Fresh
Mudbound is the work of a filmmaker whose vision is uninhibited. Even when it falters through later narrative twists that become almost too much to bear, it's a captivating experience-one that we're lucky exists.|Fresh

Pop icon Blige, nearly unrecognizable, is a tower of strength and mercy as her character battles to support her besieged family through one hardship after another -- including one that is mercilessly barbaric.|Fresh
This nuanced treatment of race relations in the Deep South during and just after the war keeps adding detail until we are well prepared for the melodramatic moments in the concluding segment.|Fresh
Director Dee Reese uses the lengthy runtime to develop these characters, and we feel genuinely thunderstruck when calamity falls, as powerfully as a punch to the head.|Fresh
Initially slow-moving and measured, Mudbound builds into a powerful drama in which everyone is at the mercy of a deep-rooted racism.|Fresh
A slow and brutal burn, but worth it for the devastating finale.|Fresh
A powerfully emotional and all-too-relevant race relations drama that marks out director Rees as a significant talent to watch. Place your Oscar bets now.|Fresh
Mudboundis easy to admire but tough to watch at times. It tells a truthful tale from America's not-so-distant past. The highest compliment I can pay Rees is that her movie feels truthful.|Fresh
Williams and Rees maintain the scope of a years-long, multi-character, and period-specific story without sacrificing any of the depth that could come from it.|Fresh
...an arresting portrait of a place, people, and time...|Fresh
They're fine actors doing good work, but their stories don't amount to much. Mudbound's real drama lies elsewhere, in a relationship that doesn't even begin until the final movement.|Fresh
Though the film is a little wobbly up front, it's fully worth wading through.|Fresh
What redeems all this sprawl is Rees' precision, thoughtfulness, and sheer authenticity.|Fresh
It's the best movie I've seen this year.|Fresh
Unlike many other adaptations, Mudbound uses the detail, mood, and even the predictability of the novel to its advantage.|Fresh
Mudbound makes its point by taking its time. You have to be patient with it. There's no drama in Mudbound. This is no 12 Years A Slave or Django Unchained. This is a quiet depiction of family life, about daily endurance and survival.|Fresh
You couldn't call it a hopeful film, exactly. But there is plenty of hope around the edges.|Fresh
The movie harvests so much new feeling from its tragic images of life and death in the Mississippi Delta that Rees' name belongs on any list of the year's best directors.|Fresh
Rees always finds balancing notes here - of humanity, passion and true love. It's a tale as messy as its muddy fields, and it's a must-watch.|Fresh
For its part, Mudbound is a powerful story about race and class, told by a bold, new-ish cinematic voice in director and co-writer Dee Rees. There were plenty of tears following the Sundance screening I attended.|Fresh
Redemption and hope eventually shine through here and there, and when that happens, it's a beautiful thing.|Fresh
Both women stand out as the film's shining stars: Mulligan for portraying Laura with a romanticism that makes her subjugation even more painful, while Blige instills a hope and strength in Florence in much the same way her music has done for women.|Fresh
Rees isn't content simply to diagnose a punishing, self-perpetuating cycle: This is a film buoyed by humanism that feels chastening, liberating and healing, all at the same time.|Fresh
"We've seen stories like this one before on screen, but what's new, and arresting, about ""Mudbound"" is how easily and persuasively director Rees moves between these families."|Fresh
Dee Rees's story of one black and one white family struggling in the WW II-era South is a fiercely intimate epic that couldn't be more timely. Mary J. Blige should be on every Oscar list for best supporting actress.|Fresh
Mudbound is absorbing: the language, performance and direction all have real sinew.|Fresh
It's a work of historical imagination that lands in the present with disquieting, illuminating force.|Fresh
Director Dee Rees masterfully executes her character study, filling the frame with visuals as big and powerful as the emotions she draws from her superb cast.|Fresh
"For an epic that might easily be titled ""America"", Mudbound is never heavy-handed or pretentious."|Fresh
I'm not quite sure how Rees has done it, exactly, but the depth of heartbreak and humanity in this - just her second feature film - is remarkable.|Fresh
The story's eventual move into brutality is all the more devastating because of well-observed intimacy that preceded it.|Fresh
Rees does a skillful job making us feel these inequities as they take place over time and become the fabric of lives, the basis of the assumptions people make about race and culture - the way things are.|Fresh
Unflinching in its treatment of a difficult subject, yet boasting the craftsmanship and narrative drive of a sweeping historical epic, it's a film that's very much in dialogue with US politics today.|Fresh
Mudbound is beautiful, complex and flawless, regardless of who made it. That it happens to come from a queer black woman is both significant and irrelevant: Brilliance is brilliance, no matter its packaging.|Fresh
Mudbound is four-square and unshowy, and you might mistake it for old-fashioned. But the presence of an African-American director behind the camera affects everything in front of it.|Fresh
In its own earnest way, it is very moving.|Fresh
It's a film about being brutalized, about being diminished, about small sobbing cries in the night. But also, the small desperate hope that somewhere, someone, will hear.|Fresh
The shape of modern America is glimpsed behind the drama in this graceful, devastating film.|Fresh
Mudbound finds its pace as a tale of forbidden friendships amid the inhuman social hierarchy of the Jim Crow south, it builds inexorably to a far too believable climax.|Fresh
Dee Rees's Deep South melodrama is an instant classic.|Fresh
"Dee Rees (""Pariah"") tackles an epic story from the Deep South to WWII battlefields, adapting Hillary Jordan's novel from multiple points of view with the assurance of a far more experienced filmmaker."|Fresh
Despite its often brutal realism, Mudbound isn't masochistic; it leaves room for hope, and argues fiercely for love.|Fresh
With this sweeping epic, Dee Rees has created a racially charged melodrama that's hard to shake.|Fresh
Immediate and visceral, Mudbound boasts powerful, and devastating, contemporary relevance.|Fresh
Mudbound is beautifully shot, well-edited, well-acted, well-scored and well-directed.|Fresh
Rees uses voice-overs to bring the many characters to life, but the text is thin; the movie's exposition is needlessly slow and stepwise, and the drama, though affecting, is literal and oversimplified.|Rotten
Mudbound is an essential film in its depiction of racism.|Fresh
Mudbound finds itself unable to transcend its own conventions.|Rotten
Mudbound is as good an example as you need for why diversity behind the camera matters.|Fresh
Compelling, heartbreaking, and bold, Mudbound is an absolute must-see.|Fresh
Give Dee Rees all the awards!|Fresh
Mudbound is a thoughtful treatise on who we're willing to empathize with, and when, and why.|Fresh
The film, and by extension Rees, is fidgety as far as placing such a dynamic in focus, almost as if she's unwilling to lean towards one clear idea of what their races mean for one another, toward any answer for the question her film poses.|Rotten
If you had any doubts Mary J. Blige was an actress, 'Mudbound' proves you wrong.|Fresh
Mudbound is a small-budget movie with big ambitions. A broad and emotional historical melodrama of the kind we don't see too much of anymore, it very often comes close to overheating.|Fresh
It encompasses, with many brilliant brush strokes, the problems that lie in the American landscape, problems that still pertain to the political conversation today.|Fresh
"""The film is sweeping, but the payoff - though violent, painful, and desperate is worth every single minute."""|Fresh
"""Mudbound"" is a beauteous piece, utterly ravishing to the eyes and even more splendid on the soul. An Oscar-worthy and exquisite cinematic film that we should be so lucky to have available to us."|Fresh
Writer-director Dee Rees' adaptation of Hillary Jordan's 2008 novel contains powerful moments and loads of atmosphere.|Fresh
You could watch the beginning and end of this movie and understand its point, but the underlying ideological concerns help Mudbound remain involving throughout.|Fresh
The poverty on the farm is visceral. No matter what stations in life these characters hold, they are painted in mud, and no amount of money can save them from it.|Fresh
It features impeccable performances from a cast led by Carey Mulligan, Garrett Hedlund and Mary J Blige, and attempts, unashamedly, to ask enormous, difficult and quintessential questions about the nature of -- yes, believe it -- the American soul.|Fresh
[Dee Rees] lets her films unspool, trusting that viewers will remember and understand the choices she's immersed them in and put the pieces together themselves.|Fresh
Though Mudbound represent a period of injustice consigned to history, its examination of a toxic, racist masculinity stuck in the past could hardly be more relevant today.|Fresh
Beautiful to look at, but way too much despair.|Fresh
A unique means of exploring prejudice, chronicling the journey of a man who helped to defeat a fascist dictator, only to then be subject to hatred from his own compatriots.|Fresh
As striking as the combat scenes are, they largely exist as setup for the postwar-set second half of the film, which scrutinizes the way that the atrocities witnessed in Europe laid bare the unsustainable hypocrisy in America's own bigoted divisions.|Fresh
It's the kind of big, meaty storytelling that can feel awfully invigorating amidst a sea of wispier indie fare.|Fresh
So many films about America's past treat our sins as though they've all been washed away. Mudbound, like the best of its ilk, knows that's not the case. It lingers on small indignities and tiny moments of grace.|Fresh
Mudbound (remember that title!) is a handsomely made, urgently relevant drama... unfolding with both a Faulkner-like lyricism and a cutting contemporary resonance.|Fresh
Mixing poetic voiceover and gorgeous cinematography, time and again the frame fills with extraordinary observations and grace notes.|Fresh
Much like director Dee Rees did in Pariah, she creates a film of tremendous empathy, one which never loses sight of its female cast members and the gender expectations they are expected to submit to.|Fresh
Rees's first film, 'Pariah,' was a small, bracing character study; here, she makes a sweeping period drama, and in one film has catapulted herself from a promising newcomer to a thrilling master filmmaker.|Fresh
Rees's magic touch as a filmmaker ... is powered by her ability to break her characters open one by one and reveal their souls.|Fresh
Rees broadens her focus on race here and communicates something that's initially familiar and eventually haunting about the cyclical nature of ignorance and oppression.|Fresh
Amidst the masterful storytelling of Mudbound, one of the most powerful punches is that this is not a period drama, in the sense that the fear and privilege linger on, and the violence has never stopped.|Fresh
Mudbound takes its time before grounding itself as a great film.|Fresh
Filled with scenes both broad and understated, Mudbound may take some time to find an engaging rhythm and poignant depth, but once it does, the powerful last act will not be soon forgotten.|Fresh
A sprawling, ambitious drama, filled with multiple character viewpoints and arcs, and yet always so confidently conveyed that one never loses the humanity at its core.|Fresh
While Mudbound is rooted in a precise historical moment, it's also a sobering commentary on timeless struggles.|Fresh
"What Dee Rees has done here is remarkable. The themes of racial injustice alone would make this movie ""important,"" but what she's done with her film makes it an epic."|Fresh
Its vision of a world where class, cowardice, and extremism circumscribe our common humanity is devastating.|Fresh
She may hit a few slip-ups en route, but eventually, Rees finds success in most everything she aims to accomplish. And these are no paltry deeds, either.|Fresh
Mudbound may be set over 70 years ago, but its layered and affecting approach to race, love, and family feels especially relevant - and necessary - today.|Fresh
if Sundance has a raison d'etre, it's to give movies like this a platform, andthis isa movie well-worthy of the opportunity to break out.|Fresh
An ambitious, superbly acted epic of racial discord ...|Fresh
It's a film brimming with rich characters, incredible performances, nuanced direction, and a pitch-perfect script.|Fresh
If the film is novelistic in its sprawl, maybe sometimes to a fault, it's written in poetry as well as prose.|Fresh
With Mudbound, Rees shows she has full command of the dramatic strength of such serious content, and how it relates to our world today.|Fresh
"""Mudbound"" soars thanks to the impressive performances of the ensemble cast and, notably, Dee Rees' intent on depicting the harsh reality of the pre-Civil Rights era warts and all."|Fresh
Mudbound is full of strong performances, singular moments, and a heavy heart, but it's an over-ambitious affair that struggles to find the right balance between its many characters.|Fresh
A hymn to what we all share - the human struggle, the mutual desire to succeed and create a better world for our children - and it is a damning indictment of those who stand in the way of such progress.|Fresh
This densely textured, populous narrative ... is given novelistic room to breathe and a slow-burn intensity that builds to a shattering conclusion.|Fresh
Its powerful moments are too often swamped by melodrama that undercuts the director's skills as a storyteller.|Rotten
