In Eye in the Sky, director Gavin Hood takes us behind the scenes of what really goes on in a war zone.|Fresh
Eye In The Sky hits the bulls eye.|Fresh
Mirren is unexpectedly gung-ho, the already much-missed Rickman gets better as some slightly jarring moments of early comedy recede, and Monica Dolan, as a principled junior minister, stands out from a strong supporting cast.|Fresh
The film works best as an anxiety-inducing intellectual and ethical thriller that draws viewers into real-world debates being waged.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky hops from place to place, decision to in-decision, from reason to emotion, to create heart-smacking tension.|Fresh
"South African director Gavin Hood, who won a well-deserved best foreign language Oscar for Tsotsi,""knows how to turn the screws. There's more anxiety in four minutes of Eye in the Sky than there is in the entirety of Batman v Superman."|Fresh
It's the type of film that will reinvigorate the debate on drone war and effect of new weaponry, but it's also highly entertaining, and beyond all else, a well-made movie.|Fresh
Mirren and Rickman bring real authority to the proceedings, while Jeremy Northam is effective as a conflicted cabinet minister.|Fresh
Hood shows us the war on terror as a literal world war, being strategized everywhere from the dust to the heavens.|Fresh
Director Gavin Hood works the tension and the moral uncertainty to good effect but at times the film feels schematic and too much like revision.|Fresh

I'm ready to call Eye in the Sky, released in the spring, the best film of the year, thus far.|Fresh

This tale is intriguingly structured and expertly executed, and wholeheartedly embraces the moral complexities of one of the most divisive issues of modern military combat.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky, air plotting, street sweeping, and home invading, chillingly and intricately maps the murky terrain of today's remote-warfare, where lives become data points and video images, edited out of existence on-screen.|Fresh
A sharply observed political thriller that should inspire moral reckoning among partisans on both sides of this contentious issue.|Fresh

An ethical debate mixed with a great suspense starring Helen Mirren and Aaron Paul. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Hood's made his movie with great sobriety and care, even if the scenario's mechanics, engineered to explore the movie's political and moral themes, could have been more adroitly handled.|Fresh
Intense and provocative, this is a thriller that raises serious questions about the ethics of drone strikes and the possible repercussions of electing malleable politicians who are often unwilling to make hard decisions in the heat of battle.|Fresh

One of the most unsettling and discursive films of 2016. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Unsurprisingly, there is ample philosophical and political meat to Eye In The Sky. As a crisis drama it also scores highly, rotating from one set to the next and linking the tense energies and tones of a superb cast.|Fresh
Mirren and Rickman do strong, measured work, with Rickman's character, rather poignantly, having the film's last word. But the real star of the film is Barkhad Abdi, the chief Somali pirate in Paul Greengrass's Captain Phillips.|Fresh
It's a tense thriller about a single action, taking place in Nairobi, commanded from London, albeit piloted from Las Vegas - and its presentation of the moral dilemma about whether to strike or not is complex and wrenching.|Fresh
"The picture may be a glorified ""war room"" re-enactment of the sort shown on television but it's so well done it deserves to be seen on the big screen."|Fresh
A drama that forces the audience to think, take sides and examine their own consciences.|Fresh
A provocatively tense thriller that negotiates the moral minefields of its thorny subject matter in crowd-pleasing fashion.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky is a suspenseful and timely, if simplistic, thriller, exploring the new methods of war.|Fresh

Gavin Hood's film cleverly explores the vexed ethics of remote warfare, and a fine ensemble cast help make this a clever, thought-provoking and deeply satisfying thriller.|Fresh

A basic conundrum; yet it's smart, tense, and surprisingly pointed.|Fresh
One in the eye for the sabre-rattlers.|Fresh
"Although Eye in the Sky offers up a range of views and an impressively balanced picture, there's no denying its ""every life matters"" message."|Fresh
There is plenty to admire, not least the mighty Mirren, who manages, aged 70, to be entirely convincing as a tough old soldier. And it's nice, if sad, to see Rickman one last time.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky is an old-fashioned court-room-style drama... Its aim is to force the audience to confront the ethics of remote-control warfare, and encourage us to despair at self-interested politicians endlessly referring up to absent superiors.|Fresh
What's refreshing, though, is how nuanced the film's approach remains. There is no simple minded resolution here and it is inevitable that there will be blood on somebody's hands by the final reel.|Fresh
Sharp editing and slick camerawork emphasise the disjuncture between the brightly sunlit killing field and the dark office where political caution wrestles military urgency.|Fresh
[Eye In The Sky] already rates as one of the most important films of our time.|Fresh
A classy, thrilling and seriously nail-biting experience.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky is firm in its didactic commitment to ambiguity. Its answer is that there are no answers.|Fresh

Hood plays heavily on our moral compass, ensuring that an internal conflict takes place within us, as we become immersed and embroiled in this narrative.|Fresh
Mirren and Rickman are outstanding, and Hood complements them by juggling theme and pace with aplomb. The result is as thought-provoking as it is nerve-shredding.|Fresh
Armed with a terrific cast and suspense and poignancy to spare, [director Gavin Hood's] long-awaited return to independent film is a keeper.|Fresh
Powerful performances from Mirren, Rickman and Aaron Paul as an American drone pilot with a conflicted conscience make this the gold standard for thrillers about what waging war is like when one side has God-like powers of life and death.|Fresh
It's a tight thriller played out smoothly but tying the viewer in moral knots. A film to think about for days, with little hope of finding a comfortable answer.|Fresh
'Eye in the Sky' offers no easy answers. But when have there been any easy answers to war?|Fresh
A real nail-biter, even in its cornier and more predictable moments.|Fresh
Both exhilarating and troublingly foreboding.|Fresh
A chilling look at modern warfare and its detached nature. But it's also a film that works as first-rate suspenseful thriller of a generally cerebral kind.|Fresh
The ensemble cast is exceptional, the war thriller is highly entertaining and intelligent, and its high-tech coverage is mesmerizing.|Fresh
An ethical and immersive film about the collateral damage of drone warfare.|Fresh
Edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, delineating the new rules of engagement...|Fresh

The suspense is there. So is the soul-searching.|Fresh
No easy answers are offered in Eye in the Sky. But the many questions it begs will remain with you long after you leave the theater.|Fresh
One of the best movies of the year so far -- a riveting, white-knuckle thriller to rank with the best of Hitchcock, and an examination of the morality of drone warfare to rank with the polemical plays of George Bernard Shaw.|Fresh
A fairly suspenseful film that makes you think as much as it does sweat. (Full Content Review for Parents -- Violence, Profanity, etc. -- Also Available)|Fresh
There's a subtle, disquieting reminder that there's one more link in the chain that extends from a control panel in Nevada to a target in the Third World - us.|Fresh
Terrorists in a house. A little girl is in the way of taking them out. Pummels you with the question is the life of the one more important than the life of the many?|Fresh

A surprisingly gripping and troubling experience.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky is the best movie about drone warfare I've seen so far, yet it still left me frustrated.|Fresh
"Nobody has made a ""how-we-chase-'em"" story this gripping since ""Zero Dark Thirty."""|Fresh
A taut, well-acted thriller that raises all sorts of moral questions - Hitchcock with a conscience.|Fresh
It's hard to imagine a movie making the audience root for the bombing of a little girl, but Eye in the Sky sure comes close.|Rotten
Maybe best of all, Hood manages to tell his suspenseful tale in a quick-moving 102 minutes. Other, more long-winded filmmakers should take notice.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky engages multiple perspectives in examining the factors that play into a drone strike, with the film's focus shifting between the cogs in the machine.|Fresh
Suspense and tension are masterfully deployed. Your knuckles will be white. The edge of your seat will see action for 102 minutes. And you will never think about drones in quite the same way as you did before you saw this timely, electrifying film.|Fresh
Strong performances and timely subject matter largely cover up TV movie production quality.|Fresh
The effect of this thriller... is ultimately one of a particularly tense (and well-acted) roundtable: a lot of very good ideas about what to think, but rarely does it ever succeed at hitting below the neck.|Fresh
Eye In The Sky is sporadically sentimental, unrealistic, and overburdened with intrusive soundtrack music. But it gets you in, and it's suspenseful, claustrophobic, and a fairly unusual take on the counter-terrorism sub-genre.|Fresh
This one entertains while also posing tough questions about whom we choose to kill in order to stifle our fears.|Fresh
Watching battle organized at arm's length is a strange and surreal experience, steeped in dread. When Eye in the Sky eventually touches down to put a viewer right into the centre of the action, emotionally speaking, it's a jarring transition.|Fresh
This riveting drone thriller is contemporary edge-of-your seat stuff, propelled by a crack cast led by Helen Mirren as single-minded British Col. Katherine Powell.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky maintains nerve-racking suspense throughout its running time and explicates some of the unknown nuances of drone warfare. Plus, you know, Alan Rickman is reason enough to see it.|Fresh
"""Eye in the Sky"" consists mostly of big-name stars squinting at video monitors and saying, in effect: ""Can we shoot now? How about now? OK, how about now?"""|Rotten
Look to Eye in the Sky, and you'll find an intelligent, well-rounded military drama, challenging both the efficiency and ethics of modern remote-controlled warfare.|Fresh
In the hands of gifted South African director Gavin Hood the film is a smart, graphic and disturbing thriller, with a clear eye for the fault lines of modern warfare.|Fresh
As the news travels, Hood keeps building up the tension in the streets surrounding the target.|Fresh
A well-intentioned drama about wartime ethics, but the film's own morality is more dubious than it realizes.|Rotten
Eye in the Sky provides an intimate look at the moral minefield that accompanies the employment of drone warfare. It's not the first movie to do so. But thanks to a deeply committed cast this one is well worth your time.|Fresh
The effects look cheap, the action scenes are unmemorable, and the plot regularly blows up its own tension-and the audience's interest-with missiles raining ignorantly down from the heavens.|Rotten
It rigs its case on the sentimental side.|Rotten
Eye in the Sky sees, like any good film about warfare, that there are no real victories, and there's no end in sight.|Fresh
Does this much discussion happen with every drone strike?|Fresh
The film not only focuses on the political effects of drone warfare, but also the devastating psychological toll it takes on these operators.|Fresh
Director Gavin Hood takes a daring look at the toll war takes on everyone... you'll be sitting at the edge of your seat debating what you'd do.|Fresh

Eye in the Sky is a disturbing, intelligent and very well crafted contemporary thriller with a solid screenplay by Guy Hibbert and seamless direction.|Fresh
Plenty of food for thought, if not very subtly done.|Fresh
Gavin Hood's movie provides you with more information than any of the participants might have, including glimpses of just who that collateral damage will be.|Fresh
Tight editing (there's never any dislocation in sense of place while locale hopping) and well-framed shots hold the tension, as does Hibbert's well-gamed chess match of statesmanship and foreign policy.|Fresh
Game of Drones, indeed. Excellent ensemble cast, nerve-shattering, technological high-wire act. Mirren, Rickman (sigh) and Abdi in top form.|Fresh
For the foreseeable future, we will be having a debate about the efficacy of drone strikes ... Eye in the Sky establishes itself as an important part of that conversation.|Fresh
Hood ratchets up the tension and keeps it there.|Fresh
A sober but not-quite-somber drone drama that ably portrays the complicated moral calculus involved in modern warfare.|Fresh
As the creepy title might suggest, the movie explores the danger of detachment in modern warfare, recording the complex moral and political debate among characters charged with making life-or-death decisions.|Fresh
Mr. Rickman was never nominated for an Academy Award and it's probably a long shot for a posthumous supporting actor for this film -- but his work here is a reminder of what a special talent he possessed.|Fresh
It's clockwork entertainment, in the end - a precisely calibrated schematic in which every aspect of the ethical quandary balances every other aspect, and the only variable is your own moral compass.|Fresh
What South African director Gavin Hood and his filmmakers do with the military drone drama Eye in the Sky is nothing short of astonishing.|Fresh
This is the rare military drama that conveys both the graphic physical effects of war and its lingering psychic cost.|Fresh
"""Eye in the Sky"" is refreshing in its lack of a political message."|Fresh
It's suspenseful and it raises many compelling questions.|Fresh
A nifty little thriller...a tense, tough, biting commentary on the way wars are fought today.|Fresh
"This is the kind of intelligent, thought-provoking mainstream film that's in danger of becoming extinct. ""Eye in the Sky"" is miles above the average multiplex flick."|Fresh
War is hell, they say. Hood shows us the many ways how.|Fresh
At times, the film approaches gallows comedy ... perhaps a little too much so; at others, it's a tense, chilling look at a seemingly unbearable choice - refreshingly, without telling its viewers what to think.|Fresh
A thoughtful, slow-building thriller.|Fresh
...a film that is timely, certainly relevant, but as a thriller it gets bogged down in minutiae that may be authentic but isn't always entertaining.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky is mired in simplicity.|Rotten
Profound examination of the psychic ramifications involving modern day warfare and long-range gun-play.|Fresh
Director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Guy Hibbert have their hearts in the right place in this modern morality play set amidst the ongoing war on terror...|Fresh
Seems like a remake of Gable's 'Command Decision' updated for the 21st Century. The tension crackles as time is a-wastin' while everyone passes the buck. This is exceptionally realistic with a top flight performance by Helen Mirren in Gable's role.|Fresh
It would have been exceptionally easy for Eye in the Sky to take either a pro- or anti-drone warfare stance and simply show the horror of the alternative point of view. Rather than doing that, the movie offers a thoughtful, nuanced middle ground.|Fresh
a powerful dialectic on ethics and violence|Fresh
Only periodically pompous and only rarely about merely flattering preconceived notions, be they anti- or pro-.|Fresh
Riveting thriller about drone strikes and their human toll.|Fresh
One part thriller, one part political drama plus a splash of satire makes for a fine, if sobering, cocktail.|Fresh
While Hood's film says very little about American policy in this area, it does suggest that its terrible subject is likely to be with us for a long time to come.|Fresh
A high-tech terror-war story with a covert mission...|Fresh
"Hood, a South African whose previous films include ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and the capable terror-war thriller ""Rendition,"" does a nice job threading together the immense web of political, legal and military decision-making behind the drone war."|Fresh
A fully involving drama about the new rules of engagement.|Fresh
"""Eye in the Sky"" is an extremely tense and absorbing exposé of the moral, legal and political aspects of unmanned warfare."|Fresh
"""Eye in the Sky"" is an important story that should stand the test of time because of its originality, execution and immediacy to current events."|Fresh
A rare thriller that grips the mind and heart equally.|Fresh
There's wit, integrity and insight here, but it cries out for a lighter touch.|Fresh
The movie is both provocative and fairly gripping, if not altogether convincing.|Fresh
"Fundamentally serious, if obviously flawed, ""Eye in the Sky"" argues both sides of its specific case, and, by extension, the merits and perils of a radical new tool for fighting wars."|Fresh
Director Gavin Hood pulls off some really tricky tonal shifts. He's abetted by a terrific cast, including Barkhad Abdi as a surveillance expert who tries to save the girl -- and Rickman in his final on-screen appearance, one of his very best.|Fresh
Rickman deserves our salute, as does a film that honors his fierce intelligence.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky is a solid thriller, but a visually static one that doesn't particularly requires a big screen.|Fresh
In Hood's Eye in the Sky, Aaron Paul's conscience-stricken pilot is affecting, and you cheer him on when he challenges an order that he considers inhumane and precipitate.|Fresh
A grim, suspenseful farce in which unpredictable human behavior repeatedly threatens an operation of astounding technological sophistication.|Fresh
This is a film that doesn't want to be easily pegged, either in terms of its politics or generic allegiances. Such ambiguity is a virtue, but for all his technical facility, Hood doesn't really have the finesse of a great, fearless satirist.|Fresh
Sells itself as a race against time thriller, but any tension presented gets bogged down by so much talking.|Rotten
[It] dwells with the faraway triggerpeople killing from comfortable chairs but refuses to interrogate their actions in any truly meaningful way.|Rotten
At its core, the film is a welcome piece of mindfulness and moral complexity on our increasingly black-and-white world stage.|Fresh
Hood and Hibbert show the nuts and bolts involved in calling for a drone strike, and it's suspenseful, inherently dramatic and sometimes terrifying to watch unfold.|Fresh
The threat of an international incident ... invokes a chain of political grandstanding and second-guessing, which Oscar-winning director Gavin Hood plays out with artful, measured intensity.|Fresh
In stressing the point that there are no easy answers in war, it scores. In trying to say something insightful, however, something we don't already know, then not so much.|Rotten
In war, everything has consequences, the movie declares, and if you think you can predict all of them, you're either a fool or running for office (or both!). No answer is perfect.|Fresh
Taut, provocative and timely, Eye in the Sky has the all the right elements.|Fresh
Director Gavin Hood treats the aesthetics of high-tech surveillance as the opaque membrane through which the prosecution of the War on Terror must pass.|Fresh
Never has a movie been able to wring so much tension from shots of people staring at screens and computer monitors.|Fresh
A taut film, photographed in real time, that supplements vivid action sequences with a moral debate.|Fresh
"""Eye In The Sky"" doesn't always get it right, and sometimes makes some wrong-footed moves, but it opens a discussion and study of how we engage in acts of war that doesn't happen often in the mainstream media."|Fresh
A tense, morally complex and extremely prescient thriller.|Fresh
A tightly-coiled thriller that refuses to take the moral high ground despite the subject matter. Mirren, Rickman, and Paul are all excellent.|Fresh
While this performance gives the drama psychological weight, efforts of those on the ground to get the girl out of harm's way introduce very satisfying action elements.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky is a tick-tock suspense exercise as well as a neat little ethical echo chamber, a plea for reason in a world exploding too vigorously to give it the time of day.|Fresh
Hood has relied on terse and efficient storytelling to showcase the intricate morality of drone warfare and takes us through one very long and very stressful day in the lives of those tasked with making life or death decisions.|Fresh
A rivetingly suspenseful drama that deftly intertwines elements of ticking-clock thriller and tragic farce.|Fresh
The military thriller occasionally grinds to a halt to host a Reddit-like debate on drones. Surprisingly, it still works and manages to present valid, even-keeled positions, too. No trolling necessary.|Fresh
Eye in the Sky presents a talented ensemble of differing perspectives on the controversial use of drone missiles, forcing us to confront our own feelings about the complicated implications of modern warfare.|Fresh
