'Cam' breathes the air of a classic thriller, but speaks in a language that only addicts to new technologies will understand. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cam, much like 2017's Get Out, is a reminder of horror's potential for fostering awareness and understanding. And it works-we root for Alice all the way to the end.|Fresh
CAM will suck you in, chew you up, and spit you out. But, be warned: once you hit play, you'll need plenty of time post-credits to do your own digesting.|Fresh
The film is very interesting presenting a daring theme especially in regards to the horror of losing your life on the internet. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Devilishly well-constructed with plenty of chilling twists and turns, Cam is a modern day De Palma-esque techno-thriller that elevates above standard Black Mirror fare through clever direction and a committed lead performance.|Fresh

Today's society feels a certain cynicism towards the world explored in Cam, but it's no match for the terror caused by something inimaginable and improbable.|Fresh
A psychological thriller, a horror tale about today's technology, a woman-empowering knockout punch...Cam works on many levels besides being a tour de force visceral experience.|Fresh
It's dystopian now. It's a road that follows back into itself, repeating on and on. It's a data-mosh where all that matters in this or that world is persona.|Fresh
Cam is as much a respectful portrait of a section of an [much-maligned] industry as it is a horror film.|Fresh
It's an admittedly outrageous premise that's employed, at the outset, to surprisingly compelling effect by director Daniel Goldhaber and scripter Isa Mazzei...|Fresh
"This film isn't about a ""near future experience"", it's about the present."|Fresh
An existential techno-horror meltdown for the current, performative era of the digital age.|Fresh
It's a unique, tense, surprising, genre-blender that doesn't quite stick the landing but makes the trip worth it nonetheless.|Fresh
Cam is an effective, taut thriller that keeps the viewer engaged, and while it doesn't quite stick the landing, it is a compelling and satisfying watch.|Fresh
If Cam falls just shy of total perfection, the depth and volume of ambitious ideas on display more than warrants an intimate, active viewing experience.|Fresh
Disturbing thriller about webcam porn has graphic violence.|Rotten
Absorbing and erotic techno-thriller.|Fresh
Boasting an excellent lead performance from Brewer and with some good restraint and smart writing, Cam prevails as an alarming, distinct horror-lite effort.|Fresh
CAM uses the horror genre to showcase an empowering narrative for sex workers in a time when laws still endanger and exploit those in the industry.|Fresh
As a metaphor it's disquieting, but the telling - with its Cronenberg-like screens, nightmarish brightness, and probing cinematography - makes it throb with uneasy energy.|Fresh
If you have no qualms with endings that aren't wrapped up in a bow-and are a fan of Black Mirror-you definitely want to add it to your queue.|Fresh
An erotic web performer encounters double trouble in this intriguing cyber-thriller.|Fresh
It treks even deeper into the maw for an imaginative and terrifying look at the prism of online identity.|Fresh
It's just too bad the the film continues to buckle under its desire to be as edgy and nasty as possible, forsaking any sense of real development for cheap shocks and increasingly idiotic and nonsensical twists.|Rotten
The plot of Netflix techno-thriller Cam doesn't entirely satisfy, but the compelling concept, excellent lead performance, and brilliant details win out.|Fresh
The terror of Cam is not jump scares or gore. What makes Cam scarier than so much other horror is that it leaves its protagonist out to dry.|Fresh
Cam never deals much with technology itself, and yet it's an effective, unnerving techno-thriller focused almost entirely on the emotions intertwined with our online interactions.|Fresh
It has the same pluck and formal dexterity as Steven Soderbergh's pharmacological mental health thriller Unsane or Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman's online gaming parable Nerve.|Fresh
It's a unique experiment, one that works incredibly well and benefits greatly from Mazzei's voice and Goldhaber's thoughtful direction.|Fresh
Cam ... [does] not vilify cam models who choose this line of work. It is, rather, more interested in how the mechanics of camming ... can have detrimental effects if not monitored properly.|Fresh
Cam is a technological thriller with a stunning and authentic portrayal of the life of a camgirl.|Fresh
The 93 minutes go by quickly, and it's a fun peek into a world that not many of us (hopefully) know much about.|Fresh
The whole premise would be silly if it didn't feel quite so real.|Fresh
CAM is less the conservative morality tale about contemporary sex work as a brief synopsis might suggest, but instead an engrossing, thoughtful film about the volatility of online identities ... and a powerful exploration of women, labor and sexuality|Fresh
Ultimately as cheeky as it is scary, Cam is a seduction disguised as a sermon, and it's all the better for it.|Fresh
Although the idea raised by [director] Daniel Goldhaber may be interesting, the development is disastrous. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
In a trim 90 minutes, CAM channels familiar modern anxieties associated with identify theft, doxxing, social media superficiality, and, yes, even the horror of dealing with customer service.|Fresh
Cam is a sex-positive, feminist horror film about a woman calling the shots on what she does with her own body.|Fresh
A psychological thriller set in the underbelly of webcam pornography, Cam is a devilishly fun thrill ride not to be missed.|Fresh
Cam's Daniel Goldhaber and Isa Mazzei enter the horror genre with a frightening expose of femininity and sexuality in the 21st century.|Fresh
"The screenplay for ""Cam"" understands that our path from outlet to obsession and perhaps obliteration can be as quick as the speeds we're pulling down. Forget the attempts at explanatory horror. These moments are the ones worth tipping with your time."|Fresh
Far from being salacious or gratuitous, Cam is an absolutely chilling, thought-provoking and sex-positive delve into the world of webcam porn.|Fresh
[A] remarkably accomplished thriller...|Fresh
In what has shaped up to be a great year for horror, Cam stands near the top of the year's best.|Fresh
A compelling narrative driven by Madeline Brewer that becomes only more intriguing as Alice dives deeper into this strange technical nightmare she begins living.|Fresh
Cam is a suspenseful mind-bender with plenty of timely feminist subtext.|Fresh
It's Brewer's show all the way, and she paints Alice as a fun flirt, with a co-ed vibe that's designed to attract her clients - a persona she determinedly projects and protects.|Fresh
Cam is rarely frightening, but frequently intriguing, freaky fun and feels unique, fitting comfortably into the tech-horror subgenre.|Fresh
Cam is not a warning against completely entering the virtual world, but rather to be aware of everything that comes with it. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cam has a lot to say about identity and the perils and pitfalls of the webcam porn industry from the inside and out.|Fresh
Madeline Brewer's fearless performance props up this uneven yet trashily compelling cyber-thriller.|Fresh
There is a better drama to be found in this area; a complex journey for the protagonist of what can only be described as a self-exploitation film.|Fresh
Cam is one of those films that obscures self-awareness and morality with sharp precision while exposing concepts many of us would rather shut down than face.|Fresh
Cam is a movie about sex workers and sex that doesn't glamorize, glorify, or romanticize the profession, and it doesn't look down upon it either.|Fresh
What ensues is SF horror evoking Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but it is also a smart allegory of the commodification and appropriation of our online identities.|Fresh
The smartly written and layered script calls out prudish and toxic attitudes towards sex workers.|Fresh
There's no denying that first-time feature filmmaker Daniel Goldhaber has created something special with Cam, though, regardless of what happens in its final moments, and I look forward to seeing whatever he does next (the same goes for Brewer as well).|Fresh
We need more stories that shed honest light on sex work while humanizing the people who do it and, on that end, Cam gets the job done.|Fresh
Don't sleep on Cam. It will give you a whole new appreciation for the people on the other side of your screen.|Fresh
Not only is the film's aesthetic eye-popping and its lead performance astounding; the concept is frighteningly relevant for life in the modern digital world.|Fresh
Cam is fun but never at the expense of its heroine, a sex worker who just wants to be able to do her job safely.|Fresh
Cam explores some of the darker aspects of the virtual word, shining a light on the perils of identity theft and matters of privacy.|Fresh
This film is about salvaging her identity in the face of destruction. It's about the pitfalls of an occupation vilified by a world embarrassed with its own cravings. Brewer plays it beautifully too, her tenacity and self-pride never wavering.|Fresh
The set-up is primed for rich psychological thrills, and Cam by-and-large delivers, following a commanding performance from Brewer.|Fresh
Goldhaber, making an excellent feature directing debut, shows an impressively assured hand at filmmaking, especially as Alice's mental state starts to blur the lines between reality and fiction.|Fresh
As both social commentary and a tense, thrilling genre piece, Cam exceeds any preconceptions and provides a bit of kinky, smart fun.|Fresh
Cam sets traditional concerns of identity and paranoia in a modern setting, and it's more harrowing for it.|Fresh
Intriguing if underdeveloped thriller... It's logical, and creepy in ways that wouldn't have made sense 25 years ago.|Fresh
Even putting aside that it's Goldhaber and Mazzei's first feature, it's phenomenal.|Fresh
Should appeal to genre fans looking for something different - but not too different - from the norm.|Fresh
There's a good short film here trapped in the body of this feature.|Rotten
An excellent showcase for Brewer, who carries this movie through so many tense passages and helps viewers immediately recognize the complicated human behind the camera.|Fresh
Unfortunately, a solid premise can only carry a film so far, and Goldhaber fails to deliver on Cam's potential.|Rotten
Cam is a rather brilliant contemporary take on the Hitchcockian identity thriller, a feminist update on David Lynch and Brian De Palma by way of Unfriended.|Fresh
Screenwriter Isa Mazzei is a former camgirl herself and it shows in the film's focus on the business side of proceedings, but director Daniel Goldhaber extends her work in a much stranger direction, piling on layers of visual hyperreality.|Fresh
It's believable enough to scare you off social media... if only for a couple of minutes.|Fresh
A bold, electrifying thriller. Madeline Brewer gives a brave and ferocious performance.|Fresh
