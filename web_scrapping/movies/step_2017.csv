Step pays respect to the small decisions and conversations that help empower disenfranchised families to break free from crippling cycles of poverty and fear.|Fresh

The rare thrilling dance competition movie that's also an underdog sports tale.|Fresh
Kudos to Lipitz and her team, and kudos, especially, to Blessin, Cori, Tayla, Gari, Paula and the rest for their incredible journey.|Fresh

... I heartily recommend rounding up friends and family (bring those older kids) for the feel-good high school documentary Step.|Fresh
A film whose uplifting conclusions are tailor-made to make a viewer leave feeling that the world is a better place than when we started.|Fresh
On the one hand, this is a joyful film about families overcoming hardships and young women going off to college against the odds. On the other hand it is tragic to know that most children don't get educational opportunities of this caliber.|Fresh
"In the world of ""Black Lives Matter,"" you can understand why step feels so relevant and personal to the girls. There is a fierce defiance to their routines. These young women are determined."|Fresh
An empathetic, sincere and compassionate film, a chronicle of achievement crucial for a time in which many are desperate for an inspiring story.|Fresh
Step is the story of young girls who are beating the odds. After seeing it, I hope audiences remember these girls never should have had to face such odds in the first place.|Fresh
A journey of catharsis that's a touch too feel-good-Black Lives Matter, Freddie Gray, poverty, and mental illness are just a few of the themes that are sampled throughout the 83 minute documentary, but the narrative is ultimately one of triumph.|Fresh
Rest assured audience members will be thinking about Step long after it's over.|Fresh
The girls of the step team don't shy away from tackling the issue in their performances. They create routines that defiantly address the Black Lives Matter movement. They embrace roles for themselves as advocates.|Fresh
The subject is serious, but the mood of the film is affirmative and joyful.|Fresh
A tight, inspiring, 84-minute package sure to lift even the heaviest spirits of even the most dance-disinterested.|Fresh
I was impressed less by the filmmaking than by the young women of Step and by their school's supportive but disciplined approach, which seems to insist that in a sink-or-swim world, sinking simply won't be accepted as an option.|Fresh
Formulaic, predictable but inspiring in some unexpected ways|Fresh
"Its hard to criticize such an inspiring, well-intentional film. What's next? Senior citizens in wheelchairs across the country starting ""synchronized clapping"" teams?"|Rotten
The strength of these girls is inspiring.|Fresh
Raw, emotional, yet ultimately uplifting.|Fresh
So, who should see this documentary? Fans of dance. Girls. Teachers. Parents. Kids. In short, anyone who wants to be inspired and touched.|Fresh
However, there is much about director Amanda Lipitz's movie that feels surface level, a trait that feels particularly troubling when her subjects represent issues (namely poverty and systemic racism) that deserve a much deeper dive than they get here.|Rotten
Lipitz presents their stories in a crowd-pleasing, readily digestible package that would be unforgivably manipulative if it weren't so earnest and endearing.|Fresh
Step is about dance like Hoop Dreams was about basketball. . .but this new girl-powered film is much zippier, more inspiring, and more energetically hopeful.|Fresh
Covers ground - the lives of black teen girls - that mostly goes unexamined onscreen. It couldn't be fresher or more important. It's also wildly entertaining.|Fresh
There are telling and touching moments, but we've come to see, over the years, that it's quite easy to find an involving story in any formal set of challenges imposed on young people.|Fresh
Certainly Lipitz herself goes deep into a first-time filmmaker's bag of tricks and somehow takes all the right steps, too.|Fresh
It's not unreasonable to assume that the title doesn't refer to this chosen form of dancing as much as it refers to the steps each girl must take if she wants to break free from her surroundings and escape into the world at large.|Fresh
There's a slickness to this storytelling that makes everything feel slightly fraudulent, even if it isn't. And yet I kind of loved it.|Fresh
Look deeper, beyond the plethora of feel-good tropes, and you'll find something startling raw and worrisome about a large segment of society -- in this case, young black women -- with little or no chance of ever bettering themselves.|Fresh
There are crowd pleasers, and then there is Step.|Fresh
Impossibly upbeat and as real as a movie can get, Step could not be more emotionally wrenching as it chronicles 19 inner-city Baltimore students' senior year.|Fresh
No movie has lifted up my soul this year as much as this one has. No movie has had me crying tears of pure joy in quite the volume this one has.|Fresh
A few quick question-and-answer chats could enlighten us, but Lipitz seems content to just observe. Not that it diminishes the film's emotional impact.|Fresh
A film that will have you dabbing away tears and screaming with joy, and leave you hungry to watch it all over again.|Fresh
The portrait of the girls, their hard-up but loving parents (two are single mums, men being conspicuous by their absence) and the school staff egging them on is in turns saddening and lovely, the drama of their collective effort intensely moving.|Fresh
The film is perhaps not entirely candid about all the bad stuff backstage, and there are complex personal issues that are not entirely absorbed. But a very likable film.|Fresh
Inspiring and uplifting.|Fresh
You may come to the film for the teens' story, but you'll stay for the grown-ups.|Fresh
"Step is a superlative entrant into the particular modern genre of film-making known as: ""Tear-jerking and life-affirming documentary..."""|Fresh
An uplifting documentary that's also realistic about the obstacles its subjects face.|Fresh
There are quite a few moments in Step that will reduce you to mush, and not because Lipitz exploits those things that make life difficult for young Black women growing up in Baltimore, just blocks away from where Freddie Gray was killed.|Fresh
With her instincts as a storyteller, Lipitz emphasises the grimmer elements so that the pay-off is all the more gratifying.|Fresh
One of the feel-good documentaries of the year.|Fresh
What's so inspiring about Step is its emphasis on the power of black sisterhood, especially in times of turmoil.|Fresh
Without a doubt one of the most genuinely moving, inspirational and thoroughly entertaining films of the year.|Fresh
Step is a powerful, must-see documentary that combines the raw intensity of a stellar documentary with the fierce dance of the best movie musical.|Fresh

Lipitz celebrates the enriching cross-generational relationships and the mother- daughter bonds, delivering an uplifting and beautiful documentary about the power of female solidarity.|Fresh
Step may stumble over its own hurried pace but such a method is almost forgivable once you realize that the film is speeding towards an effective finale.|Fresh
Realistically, it's probably not possible to dance your cares away. But the determination of these girls makes you believe in it.|Fresh
... smartly keeps its focus behind the scenes, allowing us to root less for the team to grab a competition trophy and more for the steppers to graduate to a better life.|Fresh
There are many films that attempt to illuminate the world through pain, but Step is most instructive in its moments of joy.|Fresh
Dance gives teen girls focus, power in moving documentary.|Fresh
Following the young ladies through their day-to-day lives is an unfiltered, hilarious, and sometimes heartbreaking experience.|Fresh
Step may be a touch too glossy, and unusually, a bit too short, but its power is undeniable.|Fresh
"The sneaky genius of Amanda Lipitz's documentary Step is how it manages to tell an important story-in the form of a triumphant ""Big Game"" narrative."|Fresh
Step gets the magic and pain of being a Black girl right.|Fresh
This is a highly pertinent story told in an entertaining way.|Fresh
Heartening and unashamedly emotional, it's a certified crowd pleaser that doesn't care who knows it.|Fresh
The girls' passion to excel is palpable, and the film fulfills its inspirational function by summoning up time-tested elements -- the big competition, the underdog competitors, the stumbles and self-doubts along the way.|Fresh
If there ever were another documentary whose scope and substance were worthy of being placed in the same rarefied class as Steve James' Chicago-shot classic Hoop Dreams, this really would be it.|Fresh
For most of the film the dancing is unsteady, but in the final number director Amanda Lipitz, a Tony Award-winning producer, makes the gutsy amateurs look like pros.|Fresh
You might wish for a little more depth.... Then again, the brisk pace is part of what makes the movie a crowd-pleaser -- that, and knowing that the real prize the girls are working for is much bigger than a step-dancing trophy.|Fresh
By fitting Cori, Tayla, and Blessin's lives into a predetermined narrative arc, Step reduces the girls to plucky, up-by-the-bootstraps archetypes.|Rotten
This movie fires on every cylinder, investing viewers in personal stories that couldn't have higher stakes and inviting them on a journey that pays off in ways expected and utterly surprising.|Fresh
Part Hoop Dreams, part The Fits and part Bring It On, Step is one of the year's more meaningful and enjoyable docs.|Fresh
If you are looking for a step-by-step primer on how to help kids build self-esteem and a driving ambition for higher learning, this inspiring movie is a guidebook.|Fresh
The particulars of even something as simple as stepping itself -- how the team actually choreographs their routines, for instance -- remain fuzzy, and by the end of this brief and breezy doc, much still remains unspoken or unexplored.|Rotten
[The] emotional impact of this important documentary will add to the understanding of the divisions we all face in this diverse nation, especially at this time of great division.|Fresh
Lipitz has a stronger picture when exposing concerns about potential and showcasing intelligence celebrated and sabotaged. As empowerment cinema goes, it works, but not for the obvious reason.|Fresh
Step is emotionally engaging but may disappoint those hoping to see a lot of exciting stepping.|Fresh
Start figuring out now how to clap and dab away tears at the same time; it's that kind of experience.|Fresh
By documenting the collective efforts of getting these girls into college, Lipitz lands on the film's most enduring message: the necessity for education as a community effort.|Fresh
It's the ease with which Step captures Black joy, even in the midst of such high levels of personal and communal stress, that makes it special.|Fresh
"The film is inspiring and funny and lovely, and you may find the words of one of the girls lingering: ""If you come together with a group of powerful women, the impact will be immense."""|Fresh
You get a strong sense both of community and commitment, an intimate look at their lives as well as the thrill and excitement of their dance.|Fresh
Running a quick 83 minutes, Step is as brisk as it is powerful.|Fresh
[Lipitz gives] us an intimate view of the girls' day-to-day lives and reminds us that even though her subjects have noble intentions, they are still kids and flawed human beings.|Fresh
Lipitz also conveys the passion and heart these girls have for performing, and for making their lives better.|Fresh
Three teenage girls and their mothers and educators open their hearts and lives for director Amanda Lipitz; it's quite a privilege to witness their story.|Fresh
This ebullient chronicle of a Baltimore girls step team's senior year matches a fascinating, worthy subject with unabashedly joyful filmmaking.|Fresh
It seems impossible that someone won't snap up the rights to this uplifting success story and refashion it as a narrative teen pic.|Fresh
