Stéphane Brizé's absorbing but unspectacular film stars Vincent Lindon as a working-class Joe who experiences the indignities of unemployment and, later, those of a soul-corroding job.|Fresh
There are far better films, including French ones, that tackle the same thematic ideas as The Measure of a Man and actually do something with them.|Rotten
Brizé's film offers a compelling case study in how a good man with tragically bearish fortunes might find himself in bed with the most bullish of capitalists.|Fresh
A piece of narrative fiction that borders on agit-prop in its fervent plea for the worker.|Fresh
Lindon draws us in beautifully to his character, even though there isn't much to explore. It all relies on the final scene, a weak payoff to justify the title|Rotten
Subtle, voyeuristic and engrossing, with a stellar naturalistic performance by Lindon, this is a film for the discerning cinema lover|Fresh
The Measure of a Man is a triumph of realistic cinema, and a dirge for a blue-collar European worker left stranded after a once-solid job has melted away.|Fresh

The Measure of a Man is a triumph of realistic cinema, and a dirge for a blue-collar European worker left stranded after a once-solid job has melted away.|Fresh
Built around long, unsparing takes that are scrupulously observant ... the movie makes clear the importance of employment as a means of not just economic but mental underpinning.|Fresh
"""The Measure of a Man' poses an important question - what are we losing as humans in a world that champions financial profit above all?"|Fresh
No question, it is a fine performance. Lindon has a minimalist style, a shaggy dog look, and a barely suppressed working-stiff rage that gives the film some grit.|Fresh
The subject is one that will be familiar to working-class people all over the world, and is presented by Brize and his co-writer Olivier Gorce without a hint of compromise or sentimentality.|Fresh
Uncompromisingly authentic, impeccably played and quietly compelling.|Fresh
Impassive on the surface, Lindon reveals the weight of despair in the dragging steps, the bowed shoulders, even the droop of his character's moustache.|Fresh
Vincent Lindon is staggeringly good in the part, burying so deep into his demanding role that actor and character merge and become indistinguishable.|Fresh
Brizé has cleverly cast people with an extraordinary confidence in front of the camera, which means that Lindon's customary minimalist yet charismatic performance style blends wonderfully with the rest of the cast.|Fresh
A tough, clear-sighted, compassionate film.|Fresh
An absorbing and enraging look at a broken system.|Fresh
[The] picture isn't as much of a study of masculinity as its domestic release title The Measure of a Man would suggest; the original French title, La Loi du Marché, translates as The Law of the Market, which is far more appropriate on multiple levels.|Fresh
Lindon brings gravitas and pathos to his role as the French everyman trying to stay afloat in a society that has spurned him.|Fresh
A sobering, quietly defiant and affirmative piece of realist filmmaking.|Fresh
It is sustained throughout by the depth of feeling in Lindon's granite-like, hangdog performance - as he steps into the shoes of a man forced to decide what is truly important in his life.|Fresh
You could say he's discovering the measure of a man. You could also say this is a head-bangingly dull movie full of nothing.|Rotten
Lindon's performance is a master class in restraint and internalizing emotion.|Fresh
The Measure of a Man...charts a global unease in the case of a working-class white male trying to stay afloat in Europe's unsteady economy...Brizé's unplotted, naturalistic style highlights a common man's series of on-going indignities.|Fresh
Brizé doggedly stays with hangdog Lindon through thin and thin. Bureaucracy bites at the decent man, job interviews chew him through. Frustration rests upon frustration... melancholy rests on his shoulders almost as weightily as the droop of his mustache.|Fresh
As a portrait of global-capitalist labor as inevitably compromising, it works very well indeed.|Fresh
A low-key study - quotidian in every respect - about the small agonies, humiliations, and failures of a person who is being left behind by a heartless economy.|Fresh
On this small scale and rather ordinary canvas the human drama is keenly felt.|Fresh
"""The Measure of a Man"" may be a hard film to watch at times, but with Lindon's great performance at its center, it is one from which you cannot look away."|Fresh
Stéphane Brizé's humanist drama tallies the slow drip of dignity in a downsized world.|Fresh
Mr. Brizé transforms one individual's story into a social tragedy.|Fresh
A standout at Cannes 2015 (where Lindon deservedly won the prize for Best Actor), Brizé's ode to the working stiff is a sobering corrective for anyone who's ever said 'It's not personal, it's just business.'|Fresh
In its own modest way, this quietly crushing drama is not just about how we judge a man -- by his work, by his ability to provide -- but also how men judge themselves using similar criteria.|Fresh
Astonishingly perceptive take on what it means to be a victim of capitalist progress. An amazingly political film from a director who has not made such a film in the past. Not to be missed.|Fresh
A remarkable portrait of what it's like to live in the prison of unemployment.|Fresh
The Measure Of A Man's beating heart is Lindon's performance ...|Fresh
French director Stéphane Brizé films in lingering takes, with Lindon in almost every shot, and the actor is wonderful, able to convey Thierry's conflict even when his back is to the camera.|Fresh
Tackling the same dehumanizing economy the Dardennes dealt with in Two Days, One Night, director Stéphane Brizé is far more schematic, leaving little room for any emotion -except despair.|Fresh
[A] sublimely affecting humanist drama.|Fresh
The movie becomes a masterly quasi-documentary police procedural, filled with hypnotically lurid technical and intimate details of the detection and punishment of crime, however petty.|Fresh
As naturalistic as a movie can get, this features an astonishing, if restrained, performance by Vincent Lindon.|Fresh
Teaming up once again for a film that leaves many things unsaid while saying a whole lot, director Stephane Brize and star Vincent Lindon offer up an impressive foray into social drama.|Fresh
Low-key but powerfully affecting.|Fresh
Brize's laconic, observational style is a total mismatch for a movie that wants to suggest that it's totally OK to steal on the job.|Rotten
An unflinching look at deteriorating working -- and non-working -- conditions for the common man and woman in contemporary France.|Fresh
The director's greatest asset, though, is Lindon's sad, weathered, haunted face, which invests the film with omniscient heartache, offering evidence of the sense of self that's lost in the bureaucratic labyrinth that many of us call home.|Fresh
Stéphane Brizé's [film] The Measure of a Man is a terrific addition to the low-key social realist genre that is unavoidably dominated by the films of the Dardenne brothers.|Fresh
The Measure of a Man is solid social document that offers insight into quiet lives lived by those who don't give in - despite every good reason -- to desperation.|Fresh
It was no surprise that Vincent Lindon won the best actor prize for The Measure of a Man. At its premiere, he received a five-minute standing ovation.|Fresh
