It is such a cute movie. It's so adorable, so funny, so sweet. It's corny, but not overwhelmingly corny. It so works.|Fresh
If you want a realistic portrayal of the ugly truth of high school relationships, this ain't it. If you're after escapism, this might just be the best fantasy film since Lord of the Rings.|Fresh
It's not just that it looks nice; it has a palette, a color scheme...beyond all that, it's just a great, fun, interesting situation these characters find themselves in.|Fresh
To All The Boys I've Loved Before presents an adolescent romance that appears extremely generic on the surface, but stashes away enough novel elements to feel fresh. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The pleasure of the film does not come from being surprised, it comes from experiencing these characters. Perhaps because the source material is a novel, the people in the story blossom beyond their boilerplate romantic comedy slots.|Fresh
Much of the movie's success is down to Condor's gentle appeal and her quiet chemistry with co-star Noah Centineo .|Fresh
No prizes for guessing who she ends up falling in love with, but as predictable as it is, the story is told with flair, both narrative and visual.|Fresh
If there was any doubt that Netflix is dominating the romantic comedy genre this year, this should end the argument. It's full of heart, charm and genuine feel goods.|Fresh
Incredibly funny and heartfelt with star making turns from Lana Condor and Noah Centineo, this movie is just a delight from start to finish.|Fresh
Incurable romantics of all ages should enjoy this heartwarming teenage rom-com.|Fresh
Condor is a real find as a promising actor we'll be sure to see more of, too.|Fresh
It's wonderful cliché that works... The script understands exactly where the effervescence of a great romcom lies.|Fresh
A rom-com that although it falls in certain clichés, it brings a fresh air to youthful adaptations. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The energetic, game cast and smart writing that makes To All the Boys I've Loved Before one of the best romantic comedies in years, and the strongest outing in the genre released by Netflix thus far.|Fresh
To All the Boys is a joy to watch and rises to the top of a cliché genre on the strength of its whip-smart writing and cast.|Fresh
It's a stylish pastel-tinted confection of a movie, one that knows every single one of the romantic tropes it's working with backwards and forwards, and loves them with all its pure and wholesome heart.|Fresh
This generation is lucky to have To All the Boys I've Ever Loved Before as the teen romance comedy of their generation.|Fresh
Netflix hasn't just elbowed its way to the table where teen rom-coms are released, they've knocked over the table and reset it by their rules.|Fresh
It's so undeniably sweet.|Fresh
There's a lot more competition now than there was when we wore out our Can't By Me Love or John Hughes VHSes, but I have faith that To All The Boys I've Loved Before will become heavily quoted by current high schoolers.|Fresh
...doesn't set out to break the mold, but by staying true to its characters and the mixed-up feelings of youth, it improves on what so many films before it have gotten wrong.|Fresh
There is nothing mean-spirited or pernicious in its content. Just a thoroughly sweet, at times hysterically funny narrative that manages a certain amount of endearing authenticity.|Fresh
Netflix's best rom-com yet.|Fresh
Like any teen story, To All the Boys has some growing pains... Still, we'll forgive it. Sure, it hits at core truths about new love. But it's still a fantasy, just not the bodice-ripping one of Lara Jean's teen daydreams.|Fresh
As lighthearted entertainment and a look at a too-little-seen culture, it's a welcome addition to Netflix's blossoming roster of teen romcoms.|Fresh
A delightful and refreshing take on the teen drama.|Fresh
Charming and sweet and as such is a much-needed storm in a very long drought that reminds us not just what we've been missing all these years, but also just how timeless teen movies and their coming-of-age stories can be.|Fresh
To All the Boys simmers in nostalgia by paying homage to the great teen comedies of the past. However, the film manages to make its own mark with its charismatic cast and engaging filmmaking style.|Fresh
Every frame of the movie is stunning and set up so meticulously that it makes you want to Instagram your TV screen.|Fresh
It deserves to find its place alongside warm, whip-smart teen classics that are unafraid of complete and utter romance, like Easy A and The Duff.|Fresh
It's a smart, funny, sweet, winning movie, and I was constantly amazed by how much I enjoyed it.|Fresh
To All The Boys I've Loved Before is a charming young adult romantic comedy that tells a sweet and joyful story of young love for modern audiences.|Fresh
All this brews to make a perfect first-boyfriend fantasy, the kind you dreamed of as a girl and the kind you may still reminisce over. This makes To All the Boys I've Loved Before a total treat and a perfect pick for a night of Netflix and Girls Night in.|Fresh
Stilted and scattered and strangely cold in its cinematography, it's a handsomely shot whole lotta nothin'.|Rotten
Its heartwarming and clear-eyed approach to first love and the challenges of coming-of-age distinguishes it from its contemporaries. Add it to your queue.|Fresh
To All the Boys keeps a tight grip on the formula of every rom-com and adapts it for the younger set.|Fresh
A pleasant and perfectly relatable situation comedy about a 16-year-old's awkward first attempts at dating.|Fresh
So, as was said recently about another film, leave your brain at the door and lead with your heart. Sometimes you just need to feel good, no matter what your age. This is a good start.|Fresh
Unlike previous Netflix misses, To All the Boys I've Loved Before is likely to be watched on repeat for years to come by romance fans of all ages.|Fresh
"This shows the audience within the first few minutes why it belongs in the upper echelon of ""fake relationship"" romcoms."|Fresh
I didn't appreciate what a unicorn-like rarity a good, solid boy is in a teen comedy until To All the Boys I've Loved Before.|Fresh
