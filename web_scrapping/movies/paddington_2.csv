In 2015, I marveled at the very existence of a movie that championed good manners and kindness, but I had no idea how much more those things would matter in 2018.|Fresh
How rare that a sequel improves upon its original, and rarer still is a perfect film. But Paddington 2 is both, encouraging gentleness, politeness, and decency.|Fresh
Maintains all of the considerable charm of the first film and throws in a hefty bit of whimsy, cheer, and good fun. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Paddington 2 surprised the hell out of me, and this is coming from somebody who loved the first. This is a sequel that doesn't disappoint.|Fresh
Director Paul King has once again come up with the perfect antidote to the cynicism, selfishness and hatred of the times we live in. This is a light, touching, magical film with imaginative visuals, interesting characters and an uplifting message.|Fresh
Charming and enjoyable, despite the weird hook that has Paddington in prison for much of the movie|Fresh
More comforting than creative, but so warm, fuzzy, and cozy in its comfort that one desperately longs to force it on everybody in earshot.|Fresh

Let's hope Paddington's warmth and humanity rolls onto the next generation as smoothly as marmalade on bread.|Fresh
Paddington 2 has a homey appeal and design that feels fresh yet cozy all at once-like nostalgia crystallizing right in front of your eyes.|Fresh
This isn't the expected, rushed off kid's movie, just out to make a quick buck. This is clearly a labor of love for each person involved, with each person dedicated to bringing this beloved character and story to life.|Fresh
It's a fun movie, within which lurks a poignant idea-and, yes, an oversimple one-about communities and their outsiders.|Fresh
It's kind of like what [Martin] Scorses did with Hugo where there's just a lot of interesting film making techniques that the director Paul King does in this movie that really give it a flare.|Fresh
As funny as Paddington 2 is - and it's really funny - the movie's big heart is perhaps its finest quality.|Fresh
This is one sequel it's a pleasure to review.|Fresh
In the hands of the wrong director and/or actor, any script, even one this fine, might have been a disaster. Luckily, all involved were up to the task, and have delivered to us a warm, hilarious, joy-filled film. It's just what we all need right now.|Fresh

This sequel is funnier, more charming and heartwarming than the original; one you'll enjoy tremendously, with or without kids in tow.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is a rare film, in that the sequel bests the original. Just like the Pixar films, Paddington 2 manages to be a movie that simultaneously makes children squeal with delight, and warms the heart of watching parents.|Fresh
Much of the appeal of Paddington 2 is the way it combines classic British nostalgia with fast-forward contemporary filmmaking.|Fresh
Good news! This sequel is very nearly as good as the first version of the story of a bear in London.|Fresh
There's a warmth and a joy running through the Paddington films that overwhelms in the best possible way, without ever tipping into syrupy manipulation. Maybe that's just the difference between treacle and marmalade.|Fresh
I might even go so far as to proclaim Paddington 2 pretty much perfect, but let me indulge in one more marmalade sandwich before I make the decision to say just that.|Fresh
A rare sequel that lives up to (and even improves on) the original, Paddington 2 finds the beloved bear of children's literature off on another wondrous adventure.|Fresh
"It may be difficult to find a review of director and co-writer Paul King's followup to [Paddington] that does not employ some form of the word ""charming."" This is right and just, and the achievement is surely harder than the devoted cast makes it look."|Fresh
The lightweight material and charmingly quaint depiction of a London that surely exists only in colouring books prove as hard to resist as Paddington's warm brown eyes.|Fresh
...everyone involved in the making of this wonderful little fantasy story give their all and the result is magical.|Fresh
The message is there: be kind unto others, and they'll be kind unto you - and a dollop of marmalade doesn't hurt either.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is a feel-good masterpiece, a cinematic salve for the prejudice of our times.|Fresh
I don't know exactly what I saw in Paddington 2, or why it struck me with such wonder when the little bear slapped a glob of vermilion jam on the glistening noggin of an ill-tempered patron. All I know is that it took me somewhere.|Fresh
Paddington 2 may not be the novel revelation that its predecessor was, but it has its heart-and its stomach-in the right place.|Fresh
... retains plenty of gentle charm while not becoming burdened by prior success or expectations.|Fresh
Like watching a remake of Papillon directed by Wes Anderson, Paddington 2 is charming beyond belief. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Paddington 2 is the quintessential family film that had me smiling throughout.|Fresh
King isn't content to simply tell a marvelous tale. His film is full of magical transitions, such as a flight of fancy where Paddington steps into the pop-up book to show his aunt the sights or where his nighttime prison tears sprout a jungle dream.|Fresh
Sick of surly Facebook posts and angry Tweets? Paddington 2 is the movie we need now more than ever.|Fresh
Supplies a happy ration of kid-friendly slapstick, grown-up jokes, and a batch of the most recognizable actors in Britain.|Fresh
Even in a sequel, Bond's furry metaphor survives its animation intact.|Fresh
If you have kids, take them. If you have nieces and nephews, take them. If you don't have kids but just want to feel like one yourself, go see it. Paddington is a bear for all seasons.|Fresh
Utterly beguiling.|Fresh
Paddington could melt the coldest of hearts.|Fresh
The movie is full of bright wit and sincere joy, as Paddington's innate kindness permeates all around him, providing a weary world just what it needs right now.|Fresh
If you see these movies and don't like them, there's something wrong with you.|Fresh
Paddington 2 reminds us how difficult it can be to pull off a sweetly tempered, gently moving children's movie by doing exactly that, and doing it so well.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is just as adorable as the first live-action Paddington movie.|Fresh
The result might just be the best bear movie since Winnie the Pooh.|Fresh
This bear is constantly striving to earn the approval of the humans in his life. One day, maybe we can all be worthy of his.|Fresh
The utterly delightful Paddington 2 feels like the right film for this moment in time...|Fresh
"''Paddington 2"" is ""The Godfather Part II"" of Peruvian bear movies, a sequel that surpasses the superb original."|Fresh
"Literally, everything about ""Paddington 2"" is pitch perfect."|Fresh
It's an exquisite reminder of the wondrous things that can happen when a storyteller of boundless imagination avails himself of some rigorous discipline.|Fresh
Family-friendly fun for all ages, thanks to a marvellous script, a sterling cast and the adept, sure-handed direction of Paul King.|Fresh
It's a perfect flick for families, but also a jolly time for anyone with a pulse.|Fresh
The first movie based on Michael Bond's Paddington Bear books was an absolute delight, and defying the usual laws of sequelitis, the second is equally charming.|Fresh
We need a new Paddington movie every January.|Fresh
The sequel has the same tone as the original but is livelier and funnier, mostly due to Hugh Grant, who gleams as the bad guy.|Fresh
"... ""Paddington 2"" is a total delight."|Fresh
Will appeal to anyone who has a heart for whimsy, no matter her age.|Fresh
The entire film sparkles with a Wes Anderson-ish whimsy and a kind heart that'll leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. Just like the film's protagonist.|Fresh
Mainly, though, Paddington 2 is a comic triumph chock-full of slapstick, heart, and hope. Well done, Mr. Paddington Brown, well done.|Fresh
Could it be that Hugh Grant was born to play a villainous dandy in a kid's movie?|Fresh
These movies simply know what they're doing. They retain the spirit and the humane reassurance of the source material.|Fresh
"There are slapstick hijinks and silly scenarios aplenty, but at its heart ""Paddington 2"" has something serious to say about making the world a better place through daily acts of kindness."|Fresh
"I must admit I was very concerned about ""Paddington 2"". Sequels are rarely as good as the first. But I am thrilled that ""Paddington 2"" is every bit as good as the original, and that Hugh Grant is spectacular!"|Fresh
"""Paddington 2"" is a sweet and fun family adventure, full of laughs, some surprises and a glittering array of actors."|Fresh
An adorable sequel that manages to surpass the original thanks in part to Hugh Grant's scene-stealing villain gig. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Enormous heart and energy, smartly building on the previous installment to generate a more precise cute bear attack, keeping the marmalade flowing and the smiles constant.|Fresh
Paddington 2, like its hero, manages to surprise in its winning tone, its fierce cleverness, its heart, and its humor.|Fresh
"Calling it a ""kids film"" is a disservice; Paul King has directed an of-the-moment family comedy that rivals any in recent memory."|Fresh
Paddington 2 stands out for its atmosphere of homey cheer and profound belief in the harmonizing power of warmth, politeness, and the absurd.|Fresh
What could be overbearing (sorry) kid stuff instead is wonderfully droll and charming throughout, a children's film that really does not talk down to its intended audience and should please every member of the family.|Fresh
And familiarity with the characters means less time spent establishing them, and more time for just enjoying who they are.|Fresh
This is a film of such open-hearted joy and grace, which feels rare in an industry that often embraces cynicism and sarcasm, including in its children's stories.|Fresh
An emotional masterpiece that digs deep while keeping you smiling, and a pure example of why sequels can still be a good thing.|Fresh
Mr. King and his excellent team of actors and animators spin good writing and seamless digital effects into Rococo children's entertainment.|Fresh
As with the first film, Paddington 2 never feels like it's speaking above the level of it intended primary audience, and thus the performances by the adult actors feel less like larks and more like tremendous acts of generosity.|Fresh
Can we have every year start off with a Paddington movie? The world would be a much nicer place, I think.|Fresh
Paddington has a way of finding the good in others and the lovable bear finds himself on a new adventure in the family-friendly Paddington 2.|Fresh
Yes, it's a little silly watching him converse and become friends with criminals, but it's another beautiful reminder that we should all look for the good in everyone. Can Paddington even find the good in his former producer Harvey Weinstein?|Fresh
"""If we're kind and polite, the world will be right,"" Paddington says multiple times throughout this sequel. While that can be hard to believe, the energetic optimism of ""Paddington 2"" might inspire you yet."|Fresh
These actors all yield the floor to Hugh Grant's delightful performance as Phoenix Buchanan, a vain thespian who lives near the Browns in London.|Fresh
If you can believe it, Paddington 2 is even better. It's bigger, smarter, and funnier than its predecessor; it's an absolute delight.|Fresh
Overflowing with heart and humor, this delightful romp is a charmer for the whole family.|Fresh
PADDINGTON 2 pulls you in with its humor, just as it is getting ready to bring a tear to your eye. This is a perfect film for all audiences.|Fresh
Paddington 2 never betrays the sweet-tempered worldview of its source material, the long-running series of children's books written by the late Michael Bond.|Fresh
Paddington is, above all, dedicated to celebrating the myths of abiding Britishness, from civility and restraint to an inexplicable love of riding old-timey trains.|Fresh
Paddington is as gangsta as they come.|Fresh
Charming, heartfelt sequel entertains, inspires compassion.|Fresh
Aside from being a disarming, refreshing wallow in kindness, Paddington 2 also has the benefit of being well-constructed and exceedingly well-performed.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is a stellar comedy with smart setups, superb payoffs, and belly-rocking laughs. It's a thrilling and whimsical adventure that will have your heart soaring.|Fresh
Paddington 2 ticks right along through its initially dense plot, eventually settling on a compelling narrative.|Fresh
The way Paddington embraces his fellow outsiders, like the inmates in Portobello Prison, subtly reminds viewers that even those without Paddington's good manners have kindness in their hearts.|Fresh
'Paddington 2' is so good that, yes, I would compare it to 'Babe'.|Fresh
Grant somehow filches the entire movie, in the course of which he gets to dress as a candle-carrying nun, a knight in armor, and, to his eternal mortification, a giant spaniel.|Fresh
As with its predecessor, this sequel adores its furry protagonist every bit as much as generations of readers have, and is determined to bring that love to his latest big-screen excursion.|Fresh
Could not be more adorable.|Fresh
One of those rare movies that really is meant for both adults and children ... it's a skilful mix of physical comedy, warm humour and sheer delight that should enchant everyone.|Fresh
[Paddington 2] balances sentiment and slapstick while hymning the joys of multiculturalism.|Fresh
It goes without saying that Paddington remains as loveable as ever, but it is Hugh Grant as the dastardly villain of the piece that steals the show, offering a belly-achingly funny performance.|Fresh
Unless you're dead inside, you will not fail to be utterly charmed by Paddington 2.|Fresh
Gleeful sequel to the 2014 hit family film that avoids the law of diminishing returns by studding a decent plot about a secret treasure with deliciously cheesy turns from A-list actors.|Fresh
Follow-ups are hard to do, but Paddington 2 knows which side its bread is buttered (with added marmalade, of course) and repeats the winning recipe.|Fresh
A wonderful film for the young and the young-at-heart.|Fresh
If more writers and directors respected their audiences as King and Farnaby clearly does, the world's entertainment output would be significantly improved. Just like the bear himself, Paddington 2 makes the world a slightly better place.|Fresh
You shudder at how cheesy this could, and perhaps should, be, but in the hands of the British Paddington 2 is warm, witty and wonderfully eccentric. It'll certainly make you laugh, and perhaps cry, and remind you of the incredible power of kindness.|Fresh
... Paddington, who must have the most expressive eyes ever seen on a CGI animal, has such durable charm that the film's shortcomings are overridden by its good-natured spirit.|Fresh
Not only does it keep the same characters and setting, but maintains the same level of heart and humor to become a truly unforgettable, lovely time at the theater.|Fresh
With the expected soft-heartedness, a few glorious gags, a nod to the Paddington TV series and especially funny turns by Gleeson and Grant, this is surely the best option for a Christmas movie for the whole family.|Fresh
As with the hilarious and highly entertaining 2014 original, Paddington 2 provides some of the best family entertainment you'll have at the cinema all year.|Fresh
This film is a little ripper that put a smile on my face that - hours after the screening - is showing no signs of fading.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is ultimately about the importance of remaining civil and tolerant despite a world increasingly being overwhelmed by prejudice and bigotry.|Fresh
Most sequels feel inferior to the original but this is a rare case where that isn't true.|Fresh
The suspense-thriller plot involving a frame-up is throwaway for anyone older than 12, but there is so much going on - the Wes-Anderson-meets-Studio-Ghibli visuals, the skits, Grant's over-the-top work - that the older ones will be kept happy.|Fresh
Undeniably charming and infectiously disarming, it's almost impossible not to be swept away or even find a fault in the follow-up to Paul King's 2014's Paddington.|Fresh
Chock full of fantastical London sets, a million and one famous British thespians having a whale of a time, and good cheer, love and joy. It's even better than the first one, having more jokes for the adults while a much better villain for the kids.|Fresh
Action and laughs are aplenty, but it is the film's overall tenderness and charm that will keep you smiling throughout the 104 minutes.|Fresh
The good news on the sequel is that one good minor miracle deserves another: Paddington 2 is the equal of its predecessor, not allowing standards to slip anywhere.|Fresh
With cameos from Meera Syal, Joanna Lumley and Jim Broadbent, this unapologetically British film hits all the right festive feelings.|Fresh
"There are wonderful little jokes hidden amid the slapstick: a perfectly delivered take on the word ""baguette"", and every line that leaves a delightfully camp Hugh Grant's mouth."|Fresh
[An] unbeatable distribution of actors outside their genre. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Hugh Grant] is the icing on the cake. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's children's cinema, without the pretense of being anything else. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
What Paddington 2 demonstrates is that in the currently messed-up and hectic world we currently live in, we need films like this to remind us how we need something loving to make our lives endearing, akin to the warm message of It's a Wonderful Life.|Fresh
The film's deceptive genius is not just a renewed faithfulness to the spirit of Bond's books but the clever way it is set in the present day and yet constantly harks back to the more innocent times when the stories were written.|Fresh
The new film is every bit as bright, funny and cosy as its predecessor.|Fresh
Yet again Paul King and his co-writer Simon Farnaby have wonderfully caught the playful innocence of the original stories while adding more than enough adult humour to keep the guardians entertained.|Fresh
It's as unlikely and as charming as a talking bear... a cute family film topping my list of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Something to treasure rather than just to entertain.|Fresh
It's also refreshingly designed with a timeless style that's quirky and inventive rather than gimmicky-cool, undercutting the sentimentality with good-hearted sarcasm while making the important point that we need to take care of each other.|Fresh
Hugh Grant preens and puffs magnificently. Brendan Gleeson scowls and softens with similar aplomb. Both look to be having an absolute ball.|Fresh
Beyond all the brilliant actors involved, the team behind the camera is thoroughly deserving of merit too.|Fresh
But it works. The inclusive, plainly pro-immigration stance of the original 2014 film is carried over here and multiplied, with a welcome anti-Brexit message.|Fresh
There is such kindness here, such humanity, such warmth and optimism. This is a fantasy of unique scope and astonishing emotional depth beneath the silliness.|Fresh
Paul King's crazy rhythms are all his own, packing practically every frame with a sight-gag or goofy reference that will make small screen rewatches endlessly enjoyable.|Fresh
The fim's optimistic messages about embracing otherness rather than fearing it, and the power of goodness and courtesy to overwhelm shouty aggression, seem oddly relevant at this moment in national life.|Fresh
Most of the credit belongs to Paul King, who again directs and co-writes, and is better-served this time by the clever folk in the special- effects department.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is a sheer delight.|Fresh
Paddington 2 really is simply more of the same joyous warmth, with a sprinkling of Hugh Grant on top form.|Fresh
Even though the plot's about as substantial as one of Paddington marmalade sandwiches, it's hard not to be won over by the duffel coat-sporting furball.|Fresh
It's hard to resist this understated, delicate, winningly eccentric movie.|Fresh
It might just be the quirkiest, most quintessentially British film phenomenon of the decade.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is that rare thing, a sequel that is more engaging than the original by dint of having a far better baddie.|Fresh
By turns charming and hilarious, Paddington 2 is that rare sequel that actually betters the original in almost every way.|Fresh
But the secret weapon here is Grant: as a vain, once-A-list actor reduced to advertising doggie dinners, he hams it up with just the right amount of self-loathing. At his finest, no one can do comedy quite like him and this is an incomparable performance.|Fresh
The gags, one-liners and set-pieces just keep on coming with a breathlessness that's the hallmark of the best family movies.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is the perfect tonic for these troubled times. Anyone who disagrees should be fixed with a Very Hard Stare.|Fresh
It's terribly sad that Paddington's creator Michael Bond - to whom the film is dedicated - died in June without seeing how absolutely wonderfully his legacy has been continued.|Fresh
State-of-the-art effects combine with playful, generous storytelling in a feelgood sequel only marmalade haters could resist.|Fresh
A perfect sequel - an utterly charming, beautifully judged and genuinely heartwarming tale of triumph of good over evil|Fresh
Too many times, a franchise has almost been taken by surprise at its success and produced a follow-up that is rushed and soulless. This film happily avoids that trap, but also might be one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
Mixing live action with CGI, it's a wonderfully enjoyable and brightly coloured romp through a picture postcard pretty London and beyond.|Fresh
A sure-footed, sweet-natured family comedy which isn't set at Christmas, but which glows with so much warmth and fun that it might well be a staple of festive television for years to come.|Fresh
Effortlessly great, immensely satisfying.|Fresh
A family adventure that's the right sort of heartwarming, delivering real human emotion through the medium of a small bear.|Fresh
He is a movie hero without a shade of cynicism, one who never loses either his sticky-pawed innocence or his idealism.|Fresh
Paddington 2 is as irresistible as the dessert trolley our hero pilots, and as sweet as the marmalade that perpetually clags his fur.|Fresh
Paddington 2 should be prescribed as an antidote to anyone who finds the madness of the modern world a bit wearing. It's probably possible to not absolutely love it, but it's hard to see how.|Fresh
Paddington was uncommonly charming and Paddington 2 is very nearly as good.|Fresh
Paddington 2 won't save the world, sadly, but it's existence makes everything just that tiny bit better and more, well, bearable.|Fresh
Another near-pawfect family entertainment, honoring the cozy, can-do spirit of Bond's stories while bringing them smoothly into a bustling, diverse 21st-century London - with space for some light anti-Brexit subtext to boot.|Fresh
The film is pitched with insouciant ease and a lightness of touch at both children and adults without any self-conscious shifts in irony or tone: it's humour with the citrus tang of top-quality thick-cut marmalade.|Fresh
