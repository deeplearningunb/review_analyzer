10 Best of 2018: Honorable Mention.|Fresh
A delight, thanks to an impressive voice cast, the Japanese-inspired design (a source of some controversy, these appropriations motivate further flattening of Anderson's Cornell-box-like compositions) and the uncanny charm of the stop-motion process.|Fresh
While this may not be one of Anderson's very best works, it's still a brilliant, charismatic, beautiful looking movie.|Fresh
Leave it to the wonderfully over-inventive talents of Wes Anderson to cobble together an animated feature that brings new meaning to 'going to the dogs'.|Fresh
"It's an overwhelming experience to see how man and dog have magnetic pulls on one another, but the journey to get to that place of trust isn't as easy as giving a dog a bit of a ""Puppy Snap."""|Fresh
The film's sense of real and lethal peril - its diorama-like unreality notwithstanding - is eminently fitting for a story that is so keenly attuned to the distinctive angst of the human-canine relationship.|Fresh
The story is told with ingenious wit.|Fresh
A film about the relationship between mankind and man's best friend that feels oddly averse to showcasing any emotion of its own.|Rotten
Every once in awhile real emotions peep through all the detached humor and it's a gut punch every time it happens.|Fresh
The worlds that Wes Anderson creates are so much fun, and Isle of Dogs is about as fun as it gets.|Fresh
It's very much Anderson doing his thing, but as a tribute to our four legged friends, he hits on something pretty universal.|Fresh
Without question, Isle of Dogs sets the bar for animated features in 2018 and is almost assuredly a lock in that Oscar category early next year.|Fresh
Dogs hits all the notes you want from a Wes Anderson movie while simultaneously exhibiting a freshness I wasn't expecting. It is not the best Anderson film but it may be the one that provided the most actual laugh-out-loud moments.|Fresh
Draped in quirky Andersonisms, understated humor, andbrassy real-world parallels.|Fresh
Both auteurs shrivel into their spoiled-child selves. The self-dramatization in Ismael's film actually evades personal responsibility just like Anderson's self-referential dog-puppet toyland.|Rotten
Stop-motion animation and its choreographed, symmetrical quality almost mirrors the buried, staccato emotional timbre of Anderson's storytelling to a T.|Fresh
The aforementioned midpoint-turn where all Wes Anderson movies either find or don't find their sincerity is a real stunner this time.|Fresh
Here is another joyous cinematic experience by Wes Anderson that dazzles the eye, tickles the funny bone, and makes you think about what you've experienced.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is enjoyable for its rich attention to detail in every shot and its on-the-nose doggy comedy.|Fresh
There's a big, beating heart at the center of Isle of Dogs, this time around the spiritual connection that exists between mankind and the animals they love.|Fresh
Anderson understands there are no small parts. He gives everyone in this enormous cast time to shine and the result is one of his best films to date.|Fresh
Snappy dialogue throughout that's fun to keep up with.|Fresh
I think I'm more put off by how easily Anderson assumes an authoritative voice with regards to ethnocentric bigotry and its victims.|Rotten
Another visually glorious and absurdly quirky masterpiece from the hipsters' god of cinema, Wes Anderson.|Fresh
The French version is just as mouth-watering...for me this is just about a perfect movie, literally a tale of underdogs.|Fresh
Stands firmly on its own four paws as a particularly rambunctious and winningly affectionate adventure that's as loving as a caring scratch behind the ear.|Fresh
The script is brisk, funny, and inventive. [But] it's easy to see the filmmakers didn't care how problematic their characters were as long as they served [that] narrative.|Rotten
The animation is beyond spectacular, with deep backdrops and meticulously crafted characters. Atari's little teeth killed me.|Fresh
Great dialogue, really good heart, and most of the humor does indeed work.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs makes the kind of noise we want to hear, irrespective of how we process it. It is both profoundly detailed and intimately collared.|Fresh
This is a much scruffier, less streamlined narrative than what we've come to expect from Anderson, and as such, doesn't suffer from the weight of its own pretentiousness as have some of his past works.|Fresh
Wes Anderson's latest venture, Isle of Dogs, is another example of the writer/director's editing and camerawork craftsmanship. A triumph of his own Andersonian aesthetic, yet an albatross concerning his appetite for cultural window dressing.|Fresh
Its ironic how cartoonish several Wes Anderson live-action films are, but with his animated features, his stories are the most humane and emotional works he has ever crafted.|Fresh
It's not easy to maintain a sense of cuteness while telling a relatively dark story, yet Anderson walks this line comfortably.|Fresh
While messy in parts and offering more of a sprint than a narrative marathon, there is great heart and ferocious energy in this cartoonish caper.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is intensely aware of every reference, image and visual cue; it is as richly constructed as a Joseph Cornell assemblage.|Fresh
At its core, Isle of Dogs functions as a timely allegory that celebrates young people who stand up and resist the cynical status quo.|Fresh
Without even realizing it, with this adventure you will learn how much power rumors and secrets have on people, as well as how democracy doesn't seem to always be the best solution to everything.|Fresh
It just might be Anderson's best.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is a movie that is intensely enchanting, and easily one of the best-looking films of the year, but it doesn't fulfill its own purpose. Anderson can dream up better.|Rotten
What a film to look at. Isle Of Dogs... is good or great or exhausting depending on how much you're willing to hitch a ride with the filmmaker's obsessive visual construction.|Fresh
I wouldn't mind living in a Wes Anderson film: The people there, even the dogs, seem more rational and polite than what we've got here.|Fresh
Though the movie misses Anderson's trademark humour since the dialogue is in service of the plot, and the director is unable to give deeper resonance to the events befalling his characters, the film can be enjoyed on the strength of its knockout visuals.|Fresh
The painstaking production design, widescreen compositions and lustrous color schemes are a delight.|Fresh
The film can be interpreted as Anderson's blow against the military-industrial complex, against an authoritarian form of government, as a reminder that we are slowly losing our bond with nature.|Fresh
It's about dictatorship and Nazis and the Holocaust. It's the most distressing film Wes Anderson has ever made.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs has everything one would expect from a Wes Anderson movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The dogs take on human characteristics, which makes them off the chart adorable and funny, clever and sarcastic and wholly appealing.|Fresh
Anderson presents the primal animal pack as a project management team of sorts. We see the unity of purpose, but also understand that it is not always cohesive from the onset.|Fresh
...an spectacular exercise of technique --exceptional stop-motion animation, solid voice acting, and a memorable soundtrack. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The cast of voices is extraordinary... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As in The Fantastic Mr. Fox, Anderson uses animation to talk about human relationships, starting, yes, from dog relationships. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Anderson has spoken of how he enjoys watching Japanese films without subtitles, and he takes obvious pleasure in the overlapping layers of language generated here.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is not up to par with Anderson's other films, but it tows the line of a cinema so odd and yet full of tenderness and cruelty in tune with the world it represents [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
'Isle of Dogs' is edgy, with a bite.|Fresh
Full of captivating characters and a lot of heart. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sometimes it triumphs, other times it doesn't live up to expectations. Ultimately, Isle of Dogs doesn't satisfy. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
[Isle of Dogs] is a touching film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
What it does not have in great quantity is a story or characters worth remembering.|Rotten
There's so much attention to detail in the visuals and dialogue, you'll need repeated viewings to catch all the jokes.|Fresh
As a work of animation it is beyond reproach...as a cultural statement, it just leaves a few too many uncomfortable question marks.|Fresh
"[Isle of Dogs] is an inversion of ""dog is man's best friend."" Here the man (or the kid) is dog's best friend. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is proof that Anderson has the same ability to captivate audiences both in live action and animation. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Working in this animated style, allows Wes Anderson to flourish with his style and allows all other cinematic elements to pop out more than they do in his live action films. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Wes Anderson's second stop motion movie is a visual feast that showcases his gift for detail and control. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Art should be about breaking down barriers, not putting up walls.|Rotten
Filled with heart, humour and witty dialogue, this doggone delight is the most Wes Anderson-esque movie the acclaimed filmmaker has ever made.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is beautifully designed, but narrated poorly. It's a contradiction that pretends to talk about fidelity that only serves to inspire something so fickle. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Anderson resurrects the stop-motion animation technique of Fantastic Mr Fox and tells his tale with an amazing - truly breathtakingly beautiful - range of sets and tableaux.|Fresh
Stop-motion seems, thus, Anderson's natural destiny... with the possibilities of creating a custom-made world offered by the animation, free from reality's annoying interference. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Even admiring, and often adoring, the craftsmanship on display couldn't overcome its meandering, surprisingly even managing to bore despite the plethora of interesting ideas at play.|Rotten
it is not one of Anderson's best films, yet it also puts on display precisely what makes him such a continually interesting artist, most notably his willingness to extend his familiar aesthetic into new realms|Fresh
In some ways this film is a miracle. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"With ""Isle of Dogs"" [Wes Anderson] has truly become man's best friend. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is ultimately a movie about a Japan contained within the American imagination, offering a cultural 'homage' that resembles something a white 18-year-old gamer with a poster of Sailor Moon in his room might produce.|Rotten
An amazing visual achievement.|Fresh
This may be Anderson's riff on Kurosawa's urban thrillers High and Low and Stray Dog - but it is also his funniest film.|Fresh
I see some political metaphors in this film, with a corrupt leader, born into privilege, stirring up hatred and division, using scapegoats and xenophobia to heighten tensions, fear and mistrust (sound familiar?). This is a very bittersweet story.|Fresh
The cleverness and the charm of the world means we sometimes forget we're watching talking animals, which is a major attraction of this unique and sometimes hilarious animated feature.|Fresh
The dogs are funny, and the interplay between them represents the story's greatest strength.|Fresh
With [Isle of Dogs], Wes Anderson continues to push the limits of his creativity.|Fresh
A love letter to the historic ties between canines and men, that continues Wes Anderson's winning streak on the big screen. A stop-motion dream. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Isle of Dogs] makes it clear that Anderson is still himself with a story that mixes dystopia with adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Despite intriguing storytelling concepts and an excellent soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat, Wes Anderson's tale of a boy and his dog is set in a Japan plagued by old dated American notions, including a white savior complex.|Rotten
Anderson's looking at war, retribution, notions of nationality and nationalism, isolationism, culture and individualism. And he's doing it with stop-motion dogs. He's something else, one of a kind, and we're lucky to have him. Isle of Dogs is sublime.|Fresh
That being said, the film is enjoyable and cinema fiends, dog lovers, and children should all see it. Even if it's just to celebrate it's diverse, whimsical animation.|Fresh
Anderson's latest is nevertheless all a bit twee, and there's really something very dubious about the whole thing, no matter how glorious the voice cast might be, or how cute the dogs are.|Rotten
Maybe when dogs become less doglike, especially through an esoteric lens like Anderson's, it compromises the unconditional loyalty we sense from the real thing.|Fresh
"""Isle Of Dogs"" mostly earns its spots - and its place in the upper half of auteur Wes Anderson's filmography."|Fresh
In every way, Isle of Dogs is a celebration of craftsmanship, the antithesis of the sleek, modern style of computer animation.|Fresh
One effect of this is the extraordinary pleasure of seeing imagination brought to life without any compromise.|Fresh
Your attention is mostly fixated on the way writer-director Anderson tells his story and handles his characters rather than the plot itself.|Fresh
Just as Mr. Fox must be defended as one of George Clooney's best roles, in Isle of Dogs the verbal work of Bryan Cranston entails a peak in prosody. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A one-of-a-kind animated feature so stuffed with goodness that you'll need, and want, to see it multiple times.|Fresh
Fun flick that subtly looks at how gullible people are and how they'll believe just about anything.|Fresh
With its beautiful formal imagery, its gallery of hugely likeable canines and its cheerfully crazy plotting, Isle of Dogs really is a unique experience, and a thoroughly enchanting one.|Fresh
This is outwardly one of Anderson's bleakest films. It's also one of his dullest and least emotional.|Rotten
No Anderson film ever truly made the heart sing.|Rotten
Quirky, highly imaginative and downright entertaining. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Even as a simple fable, it succeeds as another of Anderson's impeccable visual confections.|Fresh
You may not quite be able to put a finger on what you're watching, but Isle of Dogs is a hand-crafted adventure through garbage, fire, and bureaucracy. Certainly it has an all-star cast, but more importantly it has a Dog Star heart.|Fresh
"If ""Isle of Dogs"" is somewhat lesser Anderson, it's still more creative than 90 percent of what you'll see on the screen this year."|Fresh
"If you already want to see ""Isle of Dogs,"" you'll love it."|Fresh
What makes this standout from other Anderson films is that the characters are much more well-rounded than the caricatures who you usually parade through his movies.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is a marvel and supreme technical accomplishment. But it comes with an asterisk.|Fresh
When you throw these cute, likeable characters into an odd world, there's much opportunity for humour.|Fresh
Doesn't really arouse feelings, no matter how many animated dogs in full face stare us down, sometimes with tears in their eyes.|Rotten
The way this movie treats our relationship with animals makes it an unlikely cousin to Bong Joon-ho's Okja, and yet Anderson's dryly funny, tactile, and affectionate movie will... make you go home and look at your dog with fresh eyes.|Fresh
A triumph to be treasured on multiple levels, Isle of Dogs just might the best thing Anderson has ever put his name to.|Fresh
An animated movie about talking dogs set in a not-so-real place gives a filmmaker plenty of leeway to craft a story not beholden to the same old rules, so it's a disappointment to see the female characters get typical short shrift.|Rotten
By turns wry, scary, comical and deeply gloomy, it lingers on each emotional note for only moments, then hops onto the next. It's fast-paced and gorgeous to look at.|Fresh
Without Nutmeg, Isle of Dogs doesn't seem to be about anything other than Anderson continuing to disappear into his meticulously-constructed, obsessively-controlled terrariums.|Rotten
It's almost as if Anderson is knowingly allowing the actors' personalities to seep through...the stop-motion is staggering...|Fresh
It's like Wes Anderson on steroids. Yes, that's possible.|Fresh
The dog dialogue is often droll and hilarious. [Wes] Anderson has a real gift for the oddball turn of phrase and the stand-alone comment that always gets a laugh.|Fresh
While still enjoyable, Isle of Dogs is very much a lesser Wes Anderson effort.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is quintessential Wes Anderson - that fetishistic attention to detail and a deadpan-ness that saves his brand of whimsy from becoming twee.|Fresh
A one-of-a-kind, sweet-and-salty bitser.|Fresh
An imaginative tribute to dogs with some social commentary on the side.|Fresh
What happens there comes close to delightful, especially after an orphan named Atari starts a search for his own missing pet.|Fresh
Admirably idiosyncratic - thanks to its timely, politically provocative, fascistic undertones.|Fresh
"The parts of ""Isle of Dogs"" with the dogs are so wonderful that I still recommend the film. I just wish he had taken as much care and attention with his human puppets."|Fresh
Imbued with Japanese sensibility, Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs is an overtly visual film whose striking imagery, resounding rhythmic score and cinematic references almost overshadow the central story about honour and man's best friend.|Fresh
The lush, meticulous detail is worth the price of admission.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs falls right in line, and longtime fans should be happy to see a familiar product.|Fresh
It's a precious, whimsical, giddy burst of storytelling, overflowing with love and longing.|Fresh
"If Anderson's blend of clinical skill and warming sadness has always hit your cinematic sweet spot, then the ""stop-motion animated"" for you to treasure."|Fresh
The exquisitely crafted Dogs may be futuristic, but its mix of Godzilla, Kabuki theatre, hard-boiled detective dialogue, Rube Goldberg contraptions and Hokusai block prints is more nostalgic than dystopian. And, of course, nostalgia is always a lie.|Rotten
Isle of Dogs is earthy and elemental in its depiction of human qualities, and it's a blueprint that hopefully the writer-director will learn to apply to his future live-action films.|Fresh
It's gorgeous-filled with so many bits of visual whimsy and imaginative detail that it would take several viewings to fully catch them all. And it's idiosyncratic and witty and dark.|Fresh
This is sly, smart social commentary, as much fun as a barrel of puppies.|Fresh
Another delightful creation of an impeccably built world just slightly off-kilter from our own|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is charming and beautifully rendered [...] but we can still acknowledge when things we enjoy are imperfect, and Dogs is plagued by a culture problem.|Fresh
Clever, funny, sharply written and utterly ridiculous, it brims with the writer-director's signature deadpan humor and excruciating attention to detail.|Fresh
It's clear that Anderson isn't looking to deviate even partially from his well-established sense of style...|Fresh
An artful and entertaining gem that is at turns whimsical and thoughtful, humorous and heartfelt, silly and sweet -- and an artistic masterpiece, to boot.|Fresh
Not only is the handmade artistry meticulous across the board, but Anderson's eye for choreographed randomness is second to none.|Fresh
Anderson might have been a better production designer than director. But there's no denying he's perfectly suited to stop-motion, which allows him to play (literally) with myriad characters and sets.|Fresh
While it makes a few sharp points about politicians whipping up hysteria and man's treatment of animals, this is unashamedly a waggy dog story in praise of mutts, funny, exciting.|Fresh
It's impossible to watch without a smile on the face. And perhaps the occasional tear in the eye as well.|Fresh
They're good dogs.|Fresh
It could be argued that the most quintessential Anderson film was his 2009 Roald Dahl-inspired stop-motion animation Fantastic Mr Fox, but Isle of Dogs would certainly give it a run for its money.|Fresh
The effect is startling and more than a little bit mad: the film is a dippy, soulful labour of love that repels easy fondness, but grows on you, slowly but surely, like a shelter mutt who ends up being the one you take home.|Fresh
Look past the irony and stark, symmetrical detachment of the aesthetic and there is something fresh, mesmeric and deeply touching about Isle of Dogs and its tale of courage and loyalty.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is a densely detailed gift to enthusiasts of many esoteric domains...A master filmmaker at the peak of his powers created this art for you with a cast and crew of equally fine performers and artisans.|Fresh
A barking mad shaggy dog story with imagination to spare. 13/10, would watch again.|Fresh
A new high in Anderson's visual pageantry ... [but it] is also, for me, the least affecting Anderson narrative.|Fresh
It's funny, doleful and, like man's best friend, loveably bonkers.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is a delight: funny, touching and full of heartfelt warmth and wit.|Fresh
"Visually, Anderson's second foray into stop-motion animation is a mind-blowing marvel of wondrous imagination and ingenuity. But the story, best described as a hallucinatory version of ""Lassie Come Home"" in reverse, is deep in dog poo."|Rotten
While the animation may outshine the writing, Isle of Dogs is still an Anderson film through and through: filled with wonder and intricate detail in every scene with a warm color palette and sharp dialogue to match|Fresh
Aesthetically and thematically, Isle of Dogs is Anderson's most ambitious feature to date.|Fresh
I have to confess I am enamored with the animation style of Isle of Dogs that I almost don't care about anything else because it completely transports me to another world.|Fresh
The controversy that has dogged (heh) the film is well-warranted, and yet, there is much to treasure here.|Fresh
It is, without doubt, the best film you'll see all year about a pack of scary, indestructible alpha dogs.|Fresh
This movie was so refreshing, so unique, so bold.|Fresh
His movies have never been quite so piquantly quotable since he lost Owen Wilson as co-writer and collaborator, but Isle of Dogs contains some of the most finely-calibrated sight gags that he's ever set into motion.|Fresh
It is smart, funny, sweet and strange and features one scene after another in which the frame is stuffed to bursting with an array of visual delights. In other words, it is a Wes Anderson film through and through.|Fresh
Reservations noted, all dog lovers will applaud these resourceful canines and the affirmation of their importance in our lives.|Fresh
Absolutely delightful and utterly original, with its lovingly crafted stop-motion animation bursting with sweetness but also with a winking mockery. I have just a few caveats...|Fresh
I thought this was an absolutely glorious film - and all the haters are boring cat people.|Fresh
It's silly, charming, exquisitely animated and gloriously original, if just a little bit barking.|Fresh
The animation is complex, and coupled with the story, ensures that the film will garner a Best Animated Feature at next year's Oscars giving whatever Disney has in store a run for their money|Fresh
After a while such a fussy, just-so attention to detail grates - and there's only so much calculated whimsy that I can take.|Rotten
Anderson's style becomes overbearing when deployed in a precious world populated by animated talking animals.|Fresh
The main thing to know is that none of it works to the extent that you give any kind of a damn. It's so highly stylised that it all happens at a chilly remove, and we're not given reason to feel anything.|Rotten
Isle of Dogs just makes you feel good. It's not a movie designed to elicit laughter. Instead, you spend the entire duration with an immovable grin on your face, emerging out the other side with a renewed sense of optimism for humanity.|Fresh
Think of it as Wall-E meets A Boy and His Dog, then has a one-nighter at The Grand Budapest Hotel.... We get lost looking at the familiar from a Jonathan Swift standpoint and the ordinary begins to look odd.|Fresh
It's a lovely, funny and clever film, and that rare thing - one that you want to see again immediately after the credits have rolled.|Fresh
[A] wry, sly, stunningly stylized political parable.|Fresh
Lyrical, whimsical and strange, Isle of Dogs is a Wes Anderson movie through and through. That's a good thing.|Fresh
But all in all, Isle of Dogs is worth recommending. Yes, it's probably the most problematic thing Anderson's done. It's also the most intricate, the most alluring, the most frivolous.|Fresh
The dry, comedic timing is perfection and the detailing incredible. I can't wait to paw - sorry, pore - over this time and again.|Fresh
Another utterly distinctive, formally brilliant exercise in savant innocence from Anderson, somewhere between arch naivety and inspired sophistication.|Fresh
This is such a labour of love, drawing so much from its creator's enthusiasm for all manner of things - not least dogs - that it avoids disappearing inside its magnificent artifice.|Fresh
While I do believe that all the kitano drums, haikus, sumo wrestlers and Akira Kurosawa homages in fall on the side of cultural appreciation rather than appropriation, some of Anderson's flourishes still feel a bit ill-considered.|Fresh
Lovably quirky, visually hypnotic stop-motion tale of lost dogs and the boy who tries to save one.|Fresh
While Anderson's admirers may divine some underlying environmentalist resonance from a tale largely set on Trash Island, few directors have ever been as eager to poke through the abandoned detritus of societal folly.|Fresh
Anderson's latest celebration of eccentricity is a hilarious and heartfelt animated tribute to the lasting bonds between humans and canines.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is all Anderson, and proudly so. It walks like a dog, talks like a human and travels in the ennui of the disenfranchised.|Fresh
The stop-motion techniques of this director's Fantastic Mr Fox graduate to a new charm, wit and zany inventiveness.|Fresh
Weird but wonderful, 'Isle of Dogs' exhibits the same ravishing eye for detail and delightfully deadpan delivery that mark [Anderson's] best live-action films.|Fresh
There's a lot here to potentially enjoy but only if the culture clash is something you can put in the back of your mind.|Fresh
One of the film's many joys is to watch Wes Anderson's furry, soft-spoken heroes handle an absence of nurture.|Fresh
There are few filmmakers as distinctive as Wes Anderson, and while this film is uneven it also offers moments of sheer wonder. One has to be willing to overlook his missteps in return for those rewards.|Fresh
Despite its whimsical story ... the whole film is centered on such moments of remorse -- for what has passed and for how the future is being shaped.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is ... delightful entertainment, start to finish, and a beautiful story well told. Pass the dinner dish, please; I'll take seconds.|Fresh
Worth seeing and often very droll, as well as exactingly, rigorously, fastidiously composed, stop-motion frame by frame.|Fresh
Wes Anderson's latest stop-motion movie is another lovely, artful trifle.|Fresh
"""Isle of Dogs"" is a visual bento box assembled by a gifted dilettante, an outsider who loves the art of a place but seems much less interested in its meaning to the people and culture that created it."|Fresh
"There's so much going on in ""Isle of Dogs"" that it probably has to be seen at least twice to be properly appreciated. How many films can you say that about?"|Fresh
I enjoyed the film. It looks fantastic, has some terrific lines and mixes politics with paws to create something thought-provoking...but the most vexing thing is that nobody saw challenges of glib Western theft coming.|Fresh
The work is painstaking, but for the most part we don't feel the pains taken to achieve it. It's there to be marveled at.|Fresh
Not surprisingly, the movie looks amazing; that's where Anderson always excels. Narratively, however, it chases its own tail, somehow managing to be both molasses-slow and annoyingly over-busy.|Rotten
"Wes Anderson ""Isle of Dogs"" is such a feast of illustrated imagination and subtle wit in its depiction of an exiled canine kingdom that the idea of a life lived under the heavy paw of our pooch overlords doesn't seem like such a bad one."|Fresh
Seriously, if I had a tail, I'd be wagging it.|Fresh
A dark, daft vision of a culture that's Turned its Back on Dog|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is absolutely irresistible.|Fresh
What some audiences experience as whimsical, charming, and witty, others see as cloying, twee, or claustrophobic. But he is a marvel at world-building.|Fresh
ISLE OF DOGS is yet another example of creating great family entertainment without sacrificing heart and real honest to goodness emotion. Go see this film.|Fresh
It's true that Isle of Dogs is a film about scapegoating, political hysteria, and deportation. But it is also--and at its best--a film about dogs. May they never go unpetted.|Fresh
Wes Anderson continues to exercise his (hopefully) endless imagination in Isle of Dogs, creating another fictional setting bursting with unlikely heroes and another unusually appealing adventure that offers more depth than meets the eye.|Fresh
Parents: do not let the PG-13 rating dissuade you. Take the kids.|Fresh
While the film's pace is speedy to a fault, it pauses just long enough to ponder the emotional contract between master and pet.|Fresh
"But the real heroics come from the team of animators who bring the stop-motion ""puppets"" to life. They are astonishing, rich, masterfully unique creations."|Fresh
The multilayered, cross-cultural results, especially in the postapocalyptic, quasi-Rube Goldberg environment of Trash Island, are continually inventive and always delightful.|Fresh
An exhilaratingly creative work of art about love, loyalty, responsibility, heroism and the heart of society's underdogs.|Fresh
"Dog lovers are sure to embrace ""Isle of Dogs,"" a film that champions man's best friend, but it is Anderson's kinship to children that appears to inform his best films - ""Rushmore,"" ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and now this one."|Fresh
flawed but fascinating|Fresh
While it's visually incredible and amazingly detailed, it's only intermittently charming, far too long for such a thin, meandering plot.|Fresh
...a trippy and densely-layered but somewhat stillborn quasi-apocalyptic canine adventure fantasy.|Fresh
The pleasures of the film reside in the obsessive attention to detail, and the scurrying, relentless nature of Anderson-ism laid bare on a tableau of stop-motion artistry. Like all his films, a second viewing is mandatory to absorb the accomplishment.|Fresh
It is extraordinary to behold, to be sure, with images of waste and decay that are immense in their grandeur.|Fresh
The meticulously detailed wasteland that Anderson has created is rendered with his typical craft and care; from its rippling glittery seas to a glowing rainbow cave of empty sake bottles...|Fresh
"I was transfixed. There is so much to look at in ""Isle of Dogs"" that a second viewing is almost mandatory. You can forgive its fetishism. Mania this dedicated deserves its due."|Fresh
Do you like Wes Anderson? Then you'll like Isle of Dogs.|Fresh
The emotional weight of Isle of Dogs depends on knowing exactly what that bond between dog and human can mean, how deeply and irrationally it can go.|Fresh
Isle of Dogs is a beautiful film from a white, male perspective. You may cry in a couple of places, because humanity doesn't deserve dogs.|Fresh
...it's through animation that Anderson reveals his truest heart and imaginative spirit, whether it be Fantastic Mr. Fox or his latest, Isle of Dogs, which may go down as a career best.|Fresh
"Isle of Dogs is a wonder of visual filmmaking, with lively voices and Anderson's trademark humor. It's worth watching just to hear dogs Bryan Cranston and Edward Norton arguing about ""pack democracy."""|Fresh
This is a film where a character is literally whitewashed, an act that makes him more agreeable afterwards. Isle of Dogs treats this as a sight gag. It plays more like a confession.|Rotten
The crowded little universe of Wes Anderson's latest movie is an amusing place to visit, if not necessarily a bucket-list destination.|Fresh
