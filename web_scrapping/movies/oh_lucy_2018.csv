But [Shinobu Terajima's] performance, especially when matched by[Kaho] Minami's hard-sighing world-weariness, is nothing less than transfixing.|Fresh
Led by a Terajima -- who wisely keeps Setsuko's motivations vague -- an able cast creates a genre-defying movie that takes us deep into the kind of life that normally would go unseen.|Fresh
...sensitive, penetrating and frequently unsettling study of one woman's battle with regret...|Fresh
Many of the performances are perfunctory and/or badly thought out (not sure what to make of Hartnett's John), but there's no denying that leading lady Terajima is a compelling screen presence. She makes it worth the visit.|Fresh
"You will want to check out ""Oh Lucy!,"" a dark, decidedly offbeat comedy from first-time feature Atsuko Hirayanagi."|Fresh
It's a great performance anchoring an equally great, if a tad drawn out, film.|Fresh
Director Atsuko Hirayanagi mixes drama and romantic comedy in a unique way. It's a culture clash, handled quite deftly.|Fresh
I can't honesty explain why the movie works. Seen in broad outline, it shouldn't. But director Hirayanagi manages to steer a middle ground between silliness and depth.|Fresh
Setsuko-as-Lucy ... gets one of the more epic mic drops in recent memory, and Oh Lucy! itself is one of the best films of 2018.|Fresh
But not that many have taken on the Loneliness of the Long-Distance Working Woman. Oh Lucy! does this in a charmingly unaffected manner, and manages to show its teeth a few times along the way.|Fresh

But not that many have taken on the Loneliness of the Long-Distance Working Woman. Oh Lucy! does this in a charmingly unaffected manner, and manages to show its teeth a few times along the way.|Fresh
It's simultaneously silly and telling, cut through with unexpected emotion and satirical bite.|Fresh
Oh Lucy! adopts the bold strategy of taking away, as opposed to piling on, and it works.|Fresh
Its tale is an undeniably endearing one.|Fresh
Equal parts funny and tragic. It sticks with you long after you've seen it.|Fresh
Although Lucy is on a journey of self-discovery, she often hurts others in her quest for herself. That makes Hirayanagi's take on the later-in-life coming-of-age story more honest than most.|Fresh
Standing on its own as a sympathetic cross-cultural drama, Oh Lucy! deserves an extra point for the ability to eke out unexpected laughs from the most painful scenarios|Fresh
The film's viewpoint is unsentimental but compassionate...The film itself could use a blond wig - it needs to be far more expansive, antic, and disturbing than it is...but there are moments in Oh Lucy! that stay with you.|Fresh
It is unabashedly strange in the ways it assembles seemingly disparate elements, and it's unafraid to bring its character toward an unlikable place in the service of its broader truths.|Fresh
As a whole, Oh Lucy! is an inventive story that's remarkably relatable. What makes the sympathetic Setsuko so wonderfully charming is a combination of Atsuko Hirayanagi's story and direction and Shinobu Terajima's endearing performance.|Fresh
"Small but sure, this portrait of a Tokyo ""loser"" has a way of slyly sneaking under your skin."|Fresh
The treatment of its central character veers so wildly between the sympathetic and just plain pathetic that there's a blur where the movie's heart ought to be.|Fresh
Writer-director Hirayanagi runs into a few minor pacing miscalculations, but Oh Lucy!, based on her 2014 short of the same name, is a tense, observant, and heartfelt accomplishment.|Fresh
Hirayanagi gives her lead respect by framing her specific dilemma in a way that feels sincere.|Fresh
Within the confines of this cross-cultural shaggy-dog tale, Hirayanagi locates both a sharp vein of absurdist comedy and a bitter, melancholy undertow.|Fresh
Darkly comic culture clash wish-fulfillment fantasy that turns from twee to ugly realism in a heartbeat.|Fresh
This is a wonderful small movie that defies expectations at every turn; this film is the very definition of character development and that makes it something to be seen.|Fresh
Hirayanagi isn't selling a packaged idea about what it means to be human; she does something trickier and more honest here, merely by tracing the ordinary absurdities and agonies of one woman's life.|Fresh
Hirayanagi introduced a more broadly comic Setsuko in her 2014 short of the same title, and her feature screenplay (written with Boris Frumin) still finds humor in the character's flailing attempts to break free from habitual loneliness and obedience.|Fresh
Atsuko Hirayanagi's feature-length directorial debut, Oh Lucy!, offers a surprising take on the tricky art of communication.|Fresh
A middle-aged Japanese woman is taken out of her shell by an American teacher in a delightful mix of comedy and revenge melodrama.|Fresh
Revenge is served with gleeful laughter.|Fresh
Japanese filmmaker Atsuko Hirayanagi explores the transformative power of human connection in Oh Lucy!, a film which seems to play like a standard culture clash comedy but reveals itself to run significantly deeper.|Fresh
Expanded from her award-winning short of the same title, Oh Lucy! betrays some rough edges in the transition, but Hirayanagi's idiosyncratic touch marks her as a talent worth tracking.|Fresh
Touching and unnerving, in the best way.|Fresh
The tone see-saws wildly. What prevents it collapsing are the warm, heartfelt performances, together with Hirayanagi's obvious affection for her chief protagonist.|Fresh
While it's uneven, and at times seems almost artless in its craft, the story has an idiosyncratic charm that pays off in an unexpectedly touching ending.|Fresh
Atsuko Hirayanagi's directorial debut is the darkly comic story of a middle-aged Japanese woman in crisis.|Fresh
