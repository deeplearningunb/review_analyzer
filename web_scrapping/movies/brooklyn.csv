Ronan, in every scene of the film, creates a reserved young woman who seems to mature before our eyes, quietly revealing Eilis' open, yearning heart.|Fresh
An effective transfer from page to screen, Brooklyn is an emotional (but unsentimental) drama, so particular in period details of its singular romance that it also manages to be universal in its dissection of the nature of true love.|Fresh
Brooklyn is a beautiful film, in both presentation, with its lush cinematography, and delicate execution.|Fresh
It is a very sweet, lovely movie that I highly recommend.|Fresh
Brooklyn actually harks back to the kind of escapist entertainment cinema offered in the 1950s. It's all rather lovely, if completely unchallenging.|Fresh
I was surprised at how enjoyable and skillfully made Brooklyn is: I cried when everyone else did and gasped when the rest of the audience did too, but in spite of its excellent art direction and affecting performances the film is mostly hokum.|Fresh
It's a lovely piece of cinema, and one of the best movies of 2015 to date.|Fresh
The look of 1950s Brooklyn and Ireland is beautiful-each glimpse more idyllic than the next to render the film a fairy tale of sorts...|Fresh

As Eilis Lacey, Saoirse Ronan carries this film so splendidly that in any year that was not so utterly Brie Larson's, it would be a crime not to give her every award; you can practically see her eyes changing colors with her moods.|Fresh
a feast for the eyes|Fresh
It's the ultimate love story, where a young woman finds that she must choose between two men and two very different lives. It's a film about identity and family obligation - and it's truly timeless.|Fresh
A rare feel-good romantic drama that finds something fresh in the most familiar places.|Fresh
[Director John] Crowley guides us through the narrative with precision but it's a performance-driven film and the ensemble cast, especially the chemistry between Ronan and Cohen, deserve any and all accolade.|Fresh
[Brooklyn] goes back in time and deals with immigration in a very delicate manner, and without this subtlety detracting in any way from the importance of the film's subject.|Fresh
Yes, we have seen this story countless times before, but the execution here is on-point and will warm your heart while simultaneously making you chuckle frequently|Fresh
It's this fact that makes Brooklyn so relevant. As our country debates whether to allow refugees in, we need to reflect upon our own histories and recognize so many common dreams and goals. We're all Eilis.|Fresh
Brooklyn undoubtedly has a sweetness and sincerity that will melt the heart for those with a fondness for this kind of thing, and the period production design, on both sides of the Atlantic, is lovely. But the best reason for seeing it is Ronan.|Fresh

Former child star Saoirse Ronan - the girl in Joe Wright's masterful 2007 film Atonement - shines.|Fresh
Although Brooklyn occasionally felt like a Hallmark special, Saoirse Ronan, who played the lead character in the film, possessed a clarity and directness that was singularly refreshing, not unlike a splash of cool water.|Fresh
[Brooklyn] is a modern romance we can root for rather than a relic of the past.|Fresh
[Brooklyn] echoes the persona of the young woman eager to make her own life but admittedly scared of the quest itself, taking each step away from her old life at her own unique pace.|Fresh
Saoirse Ronan stars, and it's her best performance to date, which is really saying something.|Fresh
There are many reasons to recommend Brooklyn - its relatable story for one, its glowing visuals and performances for another.|Fresh
Based on Colm Toibin's novel, and starring Saoirse Ronan as an Irish immigrant in 1950s New York, this genial drama about leaving home welcomes you in.|Fresh
Starring Saoirse Ronan in a career-defining role (even more so than her first Academy Award-nominated performance in 2007's Atonement), it may just be among the finer historical period pieces in recent memory.|Fresh
Brooklyn is one of the best films ever made about leaving one's homeland in search of a better life, and forging a new path. [Full review in Japanese]|Fresh

The movie lacks any semblance of a dramatic pulse.|Rotten
Brooklyn is an old-fashioned, beautifully measured story about family, independence and the pain of separation.|Fresh
Set against the backdrop of Brooklyn and Ireland in the 1950s, Brooklyn is a gentle romantic-drama that manages to avoid cliches.|Fresh
A poignant period piece about an American Dream delayed, derailed and possibly denied.|Fresh
It doesn't sound exciting but it is really well done, with a great cast, understated but powerful, it's genuinely affecting, atmospheric, often funny, and very accessible.|Fresh
This is Saoirse Ronan's film. She's given a huge amount to do, and asked to transform before our eyes from a callow, floundering girl into an assured and confident woman. She does so brilliantly, and talk will turn to Oscars.|Fresh
Wistful and Charming this romantic coming of age drama is ably carried by Saoirse Ronan's finely drawn performance.|Fresh
Brooklyn is a superfluous romantic film that's entertaining but nothing more; its dramatic parts aren't captured with enough intensity to break down the audience. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film as understated but radiant and layered as its protagonist, Brooklyn succeeds with a simple storyline whose emotional impact aptly hits home.|Fresh

Everything seems to be in place, without being memorable even once. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film is certainly lovely and well-acted, but the nerve it has obviously hit is not immediately obvious. Perhaps it's the film's very modesty - its lack of pretense, grandeur and histrionics - that accounts for its appeal.|Fresh
An impeccable, romantic, and realistic film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A soft movie when it comes to immigration themes that allows her leading lady to shine. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The immigrant story is one that has been told countless times over, but director John Crowley's moving and funny Brooklyn brings a degree of empathy to this particular tale that is rare.|Fresh
While she's surrounded by a name cast, this is Ronan's film, and while she's made big impressions before (from Atonement to The Grand Budapest Hotel), this is her most assured and moving characterisation yet.|Fresh
Sincere, emotional and even touching, but it's far from being a great film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A subtle drama that work because of Saoirse Ronan's acting work. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Brooklyn] doesn't just look back wistfully at the past, it also transcends the period setting with powerfully timeless questions: Where do I belong? What can I make of my life?|Fresh
Part of the film's charm is the way that Irish director John Crowley manages the mood, without compromising the momentum. His direction is impeccable.|Fresh
Brooklyn is an excellent film for many reasons. While it may take its title from one small part of the world, it works so well because of the universal nature of its themes.|Fresh
It tells one woman's tale beautifully. The rest of her new country's story, however, is left unfinished... and unseen.|Fresh
A beautiful story about love and self-discovery, a great production with great direction. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Saoirse Ronan creates an unforgettable character. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Brooklyn lacks any real conflict. The ingredients are what make it atractive, however, outstanding manufacturing and notable acting work by the it's leads are not enough to save it from Crowley's bland directorial work. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Subtle and insightful at first, and sweetened as it approaches to the end, the film, directed by John Crowley, benefit from the impressive performance of Ronan. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

We have an impeccable product, with heart and Irish eyes. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lives or dies on Ronan's performance, and it definitely lives, with energy, beauty and grace. Hornby has done a brilliant job adapting Toibin's novel ... as have art departments [with] an Ireland and Brooklyn of the 1950s but also of the romantic mind.|Fresh
Not only significant as a smartly written piece of social and historical commentary, but it's also just a great, well-crafted movie that warms the heart and is a lot of fun to watch.|Fresh
Just because you can never go home again doesn't mean you can't make a new one.|Fresh
Engaging, entertaining and emotional, Brooklyn is unashamedly old-school.|Fresh
There is an enjoyable lightness to the film that is easy to mistake for simple-minded nostalgia.|Fresh
The film should satisfy those who love the book as well as newcomers.|Fresh
There's nothing [characterization] here for me|Rotten
...the sort of movie that any decent person ought to enjoy. It is full of heart and longing, and if it fails to stir something inside you perhaps you should consider that it is you, and not John Crowley's exquisitely crafted movie, that is at fault.|Fresh
Brooklyn at heart is a women's picture, that staple of mid-century cinema in which a woman must choose her path in life, and the film adapts the genre's traditions splendidly.|Fresh

It mixes open-hearted sentimentality with star Saoirse Ronan's sublimely subtle performance|Fresh
Definitely one to watch if you like raw emotion and romance.|Fresh
If there is a more uplifting film making the rounds, I'm not aware of it ... Conditioned by so many misanthropic melodramas, we assume, cynically, that the worst will befall Ronan. When this doesn't happen, we're pleasantly surprised, touched.|Fresh
I can't spot a single thing wrong withBrooklyn. An Oscar-caliber package; start betting on victory for Ronan, at the least. Heart-warming, light-hearted, and perfectly poised. Simple. Beautiful. Lovely.|Fresh
The key word in Brooklyn is restraint. Director John Crowley keeps things impressively under control in this quietly moving Irish immigration tale that is already garnering well-deserved buzz as a serious Oscar contender.|Fresh
Ronan dominates virtually every scene she's in -- and she's in virtually every scene -- with a maturity well beyond her years.|Fresh
From a dramatic standpoint, the film's biggest asset is also its biggest challenge: Brooklyn eschews showy conflict in favor of small character moments and a leisurely pace|Fresh
Screenwriter Nick Hornby and director John Crowley join star Saoirse Ronan in creating a united front against the clichs of romance, comedy and coming-of-age tropes.|Fresh
It satisfies with the nourishing warmth of a cup of sweet, milky tea Eilis may find herself longing for in New York, a comforting taste of home in an unfamiliar land.|Fresh
With sure but small gestures, Ronan manages to suggest both luminous innocence and reserves of strength that Eilis is only beginning to understand. It's a quietly commanding performance.|Fresh
It's a movie you can take Grandma to - and one that might induce Grandma to reminisce about the dark passages and tough choices of her youth.|Fresh
After a week of shameful anti-immigrant rhetoric, Brooklyn is the big-hearted bear hug of a movie a lot of folks could use.|Fresh

Saoirse Ronan plays the role of the Irish girl who comes to America, with determination and personality.|Fresh
"""Brooklyn"" is a wonderful romance, a nice change of pace in which people are permitted to act like real people instead of caricatures that serve as manipulative plot devices."|Fresh
Movies this charming don't come around nearly often enough as they should but it helps make gems like Brooklyn shine all the brighter.|Fresh
The sterling visual qualities Crowley brings to Brooklyn pale next to its casting. Ronan, perhaps, is the most obvious choice to play Eilis, but that's because she's perfect. Is she the best actress of her generation?|Fresh
Brooklyn is escapist entertainment that also is full of depth and turmoil. As such, it is a rare find in movie theaters nowadays.|Fresh
The plot of BROOKLYN is simple--perhaps too simple to justify the high production values.|Fresh
Of all the qualities a movie can have, lyricism is one of the hardest to achieve, and Eilis' journey toward making herself a home in this strange new country is as beautifully realized as the resolution of a great symphony.|Fresh
Brooklyn passes in front of the eyes, yanks hard on the heartstrings, sings a few lines of 'Danny Boy,' and then falls out of the mind an hour later.|Rotten
Expertly directed by John Crowley and adapted (equally well) by Nick Hornby from Colm Toibin's novel, this is one of the smallest, most intimate and best movies of the year, with an aching suspense that bigger, brasher movies can only dream of.|Fresh
Touching and one of the year's best films|Fresh
Brooklyn is a beautiful period drama and rich piece of romantic storytelling that boasts great performances.|Fresh

This exquisite film is one of the year's best.|Fresh
Ronan certainly does drive it into solid holiday material for the big screen, but there's also much to cherish about its look, feel and meaningful contributions from just about everyone else involved.|Fresh
The camera never strays too far away from Ronan, who connects this young Irish woman's faraway journey to all of ours, evoking the trauma, the sadness and the joys of change.|Fresh
A beautifully staged and acted immigrant drama.|Fresh
A heart-affecting immigrant love story with a genuine and poignant performance by Saoirse Ronan.|Fresh
Zzzzzzz. Wonderful performances but do we really care about a teenager from Ireland trying to decide between guys, one on one continent, the other on another?|Rotten
No other film of 2015 has dared to suggest something so simple, or do it with such painstaking brilliance.|Fresh
Saoirse Ronan does exceptional work as Eilis. Her subtle expressions keep the character interesting even when she appears withdrawn from those around her.|Fresh

... a lovely, classically constructed reminder of our best melting pot instincts.|Fresh
It's a witty, dreamy love letter to independence and self-discovery - no matter where you call home.|Fresh
Pleasant and polished and well-played. But sentimental, cliched...the most over-praised film of the fall?|Fresh
Director John Crowley and writer Nick Hornby never even try to temper the flood of emotions that this story elicits, instead wading straight in.|Fresh
Ronan lights the way as our guide back in time, to a place where immigrants found opportunity, as well as open arms, in an America that looks so lovely in Brooklyn.|Fresh
Ronan's subtle performance and guileless gaze make the movie more than a stereotypical immigrant story.|Fresh
A touching historical drama featuring an elegantly understated performance by Saoirse Ronan likely to land the 21 year-old ingenue her second Oscar nomination|Fresh
A film of quiet beauty, 'Brooklyn' reminds me of classic movie gems from the past. It also imparts a sense of place and loving hearts.|Fresh
Despite the obvious plot problem near the end of the film, it benefits from some fine performances and gorgeous location cinematography by Yves Blanger.|Fresh
Saoirse Ronan plays this interior drama with intelligence and a sincerity that seems true to the film's era. In some ways she's an innocent abroad, but she's nobody's patsy. What a refreshingly authentic character to root for.|Fresh
Simply put, I loved this movie. I can't wait to see it again, and it's easily one of my favorite films of the year.|Fresh
It's a fine film for mainstream viewers seeking quality escapist entertainment.|Fresh

The lavish set design and warm love story, the earnest performances and the movie's unflinching, optimistic tone could make Brooklyn one of the finest films of the year.|Fresh
Saorsie Ronan's immigrant girl undertakes an arduous sea voyage from her Irish homeland to America. Just like Ronan's own odyssey, it's the journey from teen to woman that fascinates.|Fresh
How to define Brooklyn? In the plainest cinematic terms, it's a female coming-of-age story, though that belies the richness and depth of the leading character, on screen for almost all of the film's 111 minutes.|Fresh
Brooklyn is a simple story affectingly told, bridging the emotional gulf one feels when ambition and home are an ocean apart and love is uncertain in either place.|Fresh
Brooklyn is that rare period drama that doesn't lose itself in its dogged re-creation of another time.|Fresh

If you're yearning to take a sentimental journey, Brooklyn is the perfect destination.|Fresh
"If you think they don't make movies like they used to, ""Brooklyn"" is glorious proof to the contrary."|Fresh
Brooklyn is an unabashed immersion in the warmth of an earlier view of the big city.|Fresh
Ronan is a fresh new star whose performance as an Irish immigrant in the 1950s is one of the best of the year.|Fresh
"Moviegoers often caught complaining that ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" should make attendance a priority, as failure to support such endearing, achingly human filmmaking only hastens its obsolescence."|Fresh
John Crowley creates a hauntingly beautiful tale of love on two continents in his period film Brooklyn.|Fresh
What sets this apart from lesser romances is the minor characters. Nick Hornby's script (working off Colm Tibn's best-selling novel) gives the supporting cast plenty to do. Every face fits the part perfectly.|Fresh
In the end, of course, Ronan completely owns this movie.|Fresh
For most of its length, Brooklyn is an enchanting, intelligent mood piece.|Fresh

The entire enterprise, a 1950s-era struggling immigrant's tale, rests upon Ronan's shoulders, and she triumphs.|Fresh
It's like some lovely modern fable -- a warm embrace of a film, full of compassion, pain, and hope.|Fresh
This could feel like an airport romance novel about a girl whose life is transformed by love, but Ronan complicates Eilis's otherwise simple story arc as much as she can.|Fresh
The film is suffused with the sense that a person is just about to bloom.|Fresh
A cinematic snow-globe of nostalgia, a portrait of two worlds that aches with family lost and freedoms found. It is a beautiful film to experience.|Fresh
A story about having to find the world in order to find one's place in it, Brooklyn recreates an immigrant experience that is separated from us by 60 years in time, and perhaps an eternity in sensibility, but that feels immediate and true.|Fresh

It's one of the most satisfying films of 2015.|Fresh
Something in the richness of its relationships puts an essential truth before us - the brevity and immensity of life. We know all about that, of course, but that's the beauty of great art: It takes what you already know and makes you feel it.|Fresh
Director John Crowley has fashioned a film that feels like a natural evolution from the Victorian novel, one in which the circumstances are deceptively modern even if everything else feels somewhat old-fashioned.|Fresh
The kind of movie that makes you want to hug someone you love, and thankful you've got them close enough to do so.|Fresh
Brooklyn is about more than choosing between lads. This is about choosing between fates in an era of newly won independence.|Fresh

There's a basic emotional truth about the material which stays with you.|Fresh
I am sure admirers of the book will feel justice has been done.|Fresh
Those who discover the film, whether by design or accident, will be wooed by its subtle spell and enriched by its deceptively low-key charm.|Fresh
Although at heart an old-fashioned romance, Brooklyn is also a chick flick in another sense: The film is dominated by women.|Fresh

The atmosphere's charming to be sure, but the drama sags from the weight of its mildness. Still, Ronan is unforgettable.|Fresh
The Irish expat experience, a poignant mix of aspiration and nostalgia, pervades Brooklyn, sensitively adapted by Nick Hornby from Colm Tibn's 2009 prizewinning novel.|Fresh

It's hard to write about it without resorting to cliches, because here are some good descriptors: luminous, poignant, poetic, heartwarming, elegiac.|Fresh

Saoirse Ronan, who must be among the front-runners for the Best Actress Oscar, gives a remarkable performance as Eilis Lacey, a young woman who moves from small-town Ireland to New York.|Fresh

This is an old-fashioned entertainment, but one so masterfully crafted and heartfelt that it's hard not to love.|Fresh
Brooklyn has an old-fashioned perfection so incandescent, and so winning, that it's almost spooky. It could have come from an alternative, postmodern universe.|Fresh
Like 'Carol,' another new retro-style melodrama about a cross-culture romance that should play out as normal but for many reasons can't, it takes a view of love from the purely but no less loaded side of the practical.|Fresh
"""Brooklyn"" delivers pure enjoyment in its storytelling, visuals, characters and, most of all, its leading lady."|Fresh
This calm, spellbinding movie is the rare literary adaptation that rewards a book's fans with unexpected insights while taking on a vibrant life of its own.|Fresh

Brooklyn doesn't quite capture Brooklyn, but its ambivalence about being Irish is gloriously epic.|Fresh

It's unashamed old school style and charm evokes the era of Classic Hollywood, and its characters are beautifully written and portrayed and worthy of our heart and time.|Fresh
There's great humor and touching, tentative romance. And gradually the film turns its very specific story of one immigrant into a moving group portrait.|Fresh
It's certainly a compliment to director John Crowley and screenwriter Nick Hornby (adapting the novel by Colm Tibn) that the film calls to mind Steven Spielberg and even John Ford in its willingness to commit to the grand gesture.|Fresh
Ms. Ronan uses everything - her posture, her eyebrows, her breath, her teeth, her pores - to convey a process of change that is both seismic and subtle.|Fresh
"A godsend for audiences who hunger for rich emotion presented with wit, grace and not a trace of sentimentality, ""Brooklyn"" illustrates the power of restraint in dealing with poignant, impassioned material."|Fresh
