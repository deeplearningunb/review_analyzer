Lean on Pete draws you in and denies you the chance to reach out for a desperate protective embrace of Charley. Haigh's unforgettable adaptation makes you bear witness to this fragile flame nursed through the unforgiving world.|Fresh

A rare misstep for A24, Lean on Pete had me wanting to trade places with the titular equine by the bitter end.|Rotten

Plummer plays the part with an emotional discipline that belies his youth.|Fresh
A moving lead performance by Plummer, who captures the inexpressive young Charley's pain, confusion and anger with few words.|Fresh

This is realism almost too gritty to take, but with just enough light mixed in so that we keep looking to the horizon.|Fresh
Tough to take but impossible to turn away from. An indelible, remarkably moving glimpse into the margins of American life as seen from the point of view of a boy in search of a safe place to call home.|Fresh
... a coming-of-age story delivered in the most compassionate of tones.|Fresh
When the character suffers, you feel it, even if it's removed in a way.|Fresh
Haigh's fourth feature film luxuriates in trauma but trots a fine line, rarely dipping into cheap sentimentality.|Fresh
Haigh loses the reins somewhat as the film drifts away from the tracks and becomes obsessed, as so many European filmmakers are when working in the USA, by the vast, great American vista.|Rotten
The strong performances and crisp cinematography can't ease the relentless grimness of Lean on Pete, making it a film I just couldn't connect with no matter how hard I tried.|Rotten
Bleak yet beautiful, Lean on Pete takes surprising, unexpected turns in direction and narrative, albeit its cathartic final moments are quite conventional...the tears are earned.|Fresh
The shots of Charley and Pete in the desert searching for his aunt recall Wim Wenders Paris, Texas. Plummer's performance is of the finest caliber and the driving force behind the film.|Fresh
Lean on Pete is a devastating but enriching study of the ways the world tests our innocence, and the very understandable desire to hold onto it.|Fresh
Plummer's impassive languor is the perfect reflection of the distant and aseptic way in which Haigh looks at that world. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Although it's promoted as a movie about the relationship between a young man and a horse, Lean on Pete is much more than that. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""A solid melodrama about orphanage, devoid of sentimentality, but also of cruelty""."|Fresh
Indigence and Instagram filters, you know, are not usually good travel companions. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten

Haigh's rumination on America, safety, and security becomes an emotional trek that will resonate with many.|Fresh
Unlike with Haigh's previous films, Weekend and 45 Years, this is the first time where I found the filmmaker's penchant for ambiguity to work effectively.|Fresh
Emotionally moving unconventional arthouse poor boy meets poor horse drama.|Fresh
From Steve Buscemi to Steve Zahn (who appears in the last minutes of the film), the secondary characters of Lean on Pete stand out for their three-dimensionality. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Lean on Pete"" is a film that takes its time, and asks you to do the same. It is one that requires thought and some patience. And that patience is rewarded with an ending sequence that feels like the peace that comes at the end of a very long day."|Fresh
Unfortunately this time the script is the one that ends up not being up to par as Haigh's previous projects. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
It's the messiness of his quest and all its missteps that make him feel real. Rather than rebellion or ego, Charley is driven purely by hope.|Fresh
Newcomer Charlie Plummer's performance carries the film appealingly, and it benefits greatly from well-crafted performances from Buscemi and Sevigny.|Fresh
Andrew Haigh's film about a young man and his horse shatters the expectations of his own genre and becomes one of the best proposals of the year. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Haigh manages to create a film that possesses the same natural majesty and virile beauty of a horse that has no hands, but does not need them to give all the support that a poor human breeding needs. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
And as the film enters into its final third, Plummer is steady and brilliant demonstrating not only Charley's growth, but also how his naivety becomes mixed with darkness.|Fresh
Writer-director Andrew Haigh's Lean On Pete is a pitch-perfect adaptation, gorgeously made and difficult to watch.|Fresh
Lean on Pete may be difficult to sit through, to view without wanting to look away, but I urge you to see it, to look, and, through it, to understand the true extent of economic inequality in one of the wealthiest nations on earth.|Fresh
In quietly respecting the grueling decisions that affect one economically distressed kid every waking moment, the film stubbornly reminds us why no matter how hard things get, the American gamble will always be one worth taking.|Fresh
In Charley's America, love is the rarest thing there is. With this horse, this frightened and famished kid finally understands love as something he is capable of. And that's something worth a lot of noise.|Fresh
It will be hard to get through the film with dry eyes, but its lasting satisfaction and tenderness make it all worth it.|Fresh
An exquisitely tender and affecting picture. Haigh's handling of loneliness, isolation and tragedy is raw yet delicate yet devastatingly authentic, in a movie that's always sensitive yet never sentimental.|Fresh
There are sad moments in store, but it's a story told quite beautifully...|Fresh
A sobering portrait of a boy on his own that reveals the universal yearning for home|Fresh

Once again [director Andrew Haigh] does not waste a scene or a line of dialogue. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A clearheaded, unsentimental portrayal of the perilous life of poor Americans living outside of the social mainstream.|Fresh
At its heart, this is a story about wounded people stuck in unhappy lives and all the many and terrible ways they try and fail and try again to make do.|Fresh
Neither falsely optimistic nor hopeless, Lean on Pete is a deeply humane film that is never anything less than believable.|Fresh
A listless but lyrical, sometimes touching picaresque across the mesas of Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming, where Charley runs into the forgotten corners of post-crash American culture.|Fresh
After the long, slow burn of the first half, Lean on Pete takes a Walkabout-like veer into the desert void, and like an old horse getting a sudden shock, the film suddenly comes charging to life.|Fresh
A pleasing cross between All The Pretty Horses and The Straight Story, with a rite-of-passage dollop of American Honey.|Fresh
For all its sometimes over-episodic structure, Haigh has crafted a quietly affecting coming-of-age journey tale sustained by a central performance that never feels forced or contrived.|Fresh
Lean on Pete's brand is intimacy; there's nothing more intimate than figures cut out on the horizon, a sunset for two. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It also doesn't hurt that [Andrew] Haigh finds something redeeming about his characters, even if Charley can be foolish and Del underhanded.|Fresh
Andrew Haigh... infuses the film with warmth and honesty, facing the darkest moments head-on as the only way to get through them.|Fresh
A performance of remarkable depth, candour and vulnerability by rising star Charlie Plummer lies at the heart of this terrifically moving fourth feature film from British writer-director Andrew Haigh.|Fresh
The entire story is told with a quiet but punctuating lyricism, avoiding cliches and obvious histrionics to play up the drama of the story. Movies are rarely more effective when they are told through a naturalistic lens.|Fresh
Plummer's expressive performance keeps us holding on until the touching final furlong.|Fresh
Lean on Pete is a beauty. Giddy up and go.|Fresh
The camera doesn't show off, but finds moments of quiet beauty across the different landscapes.|Fresh
Haigh's new film has the substance and emotional heft to be considered a masterpiece.|Fresh
The cinematography is stunning, from the shots of a boy & his horse against the open spaces of the mid-West to the dusty, drab and somehow desperate-looking rural racecourses.|Fresh
It's a slightly meandering journey (figuratively and literally) about searching for our place in the world and trying to eke some hope out of desperation.|Fresh
An outsider's portrait of America that's fully attuned to both the mythic grandeur and the harsh realities of life in a country where wide-open spaces belie the high cost of freedom.|Fresh
It's a tremendously watchable performance from Plummer, and a film well worth seeing.|Fresh
An unvarnished fable that falls somewhere between The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Grapes of Wrath.|Fresh
Rising star Charlie Plummer is mesmerizing...|Fresh
Plummer gives an excellent performance: watchful, sensitive, delicate and yet possessed of a survivor's impassive quality.|Fresh
This may not be Andrew Haigh's best film. But its slow-burning authenticity suggests a versatility to go with his acuity for credible characters in recognisable situations.|Fresh
In the second half of the film, the improbabilities mount and sentimentality creeps in. This, though, is still powerful and poignant filmmaking.|Fresh
Lean on Pete can feel like Dickens, under a starry and menacing American sky.|Fresh
A respectful treatment, and a brilliant performance from Charlie Plummer, but in truth the novel is so good that it's a hard act to follow.|Fresh
Lean on Pete isn't a family-friendly film, but its powerful message about the importance of family will stay with anyone willing to stick it out.|Fresh
So much of the success of the film is in the mood, and the sense of constant restraint on the part of Haigh. He's always holding the reins, forcing us to study the scenarios he places before us through Charley's innocent eyes.|Fresh
I can certainly imagine some well-meaning parent seeing the poster and thinking that the movie is suitable for their horse-loving child. It's not. The film's presentation of life on the margins is harsh and authentic.|Fresh
[Charlie] Plummer is good as Thompson, but not good enough to hold attention for this too-long film, directed by Andrew Haigh.|Rotten
Charlie Plummer (no relation to Christopher) turns in a terrific performance as a gritty, near-broken kid finding common ground with a gritty, broken-down horse.|Fresh
"Haigh may try to jerk tears from viewers throughout this bleak but tender drama, but ""Lean on Pete"" never feels manipulative. Audiences will likely be as attached to this bittersweet film as Charley is to his horse."|Fresh
A moving, somber, and occasionally brutal inversion of the Black Beauty narrative...|Fresh
It's clear almost immediately that writer/director Andrew Haigh isn't looking to deliver a typical coming-of-age drama here...|Fresh
There's a sunset, but no one rides into it.|Rotten
Without the pop pleasures of Sean Baker's The Florida Project, it offers a similar critique of contemporary America, very convincingly acted and directed with a fine eye.|Fresh
A harrowing and unforgettable a portrait of adolescent turmoil... Charlie Plummer...is the true linchpin of the film, giving a performance of rare insight and dramatic impact.|Fresh
Lean on Pete is life affirming in that it affirms life is hard and unforgiving.|Fresh
The animal holds a mirror up to the human protagonist...how prone youth can be on the cusp of adulthood, how reckless when desperate or threatened, how vulnerably pure of heart.|Fresh
Though it carries a strong animal-rights message, Lean on Pete is one of the most human films you'll see this year.|Fresh
"Even for those who find it difficult to connect with ""horse movies,"" there's a lot worthwhile in Lean On Pete."|Fresh
"The points Haigh makes about the people left behind in our ever-changing economy have a resonance. But don't be surprised if ""Lean on Pete"" strikes you as just a tiny bit lame."|Fresh
Lean on Pete... is content to move at a canter, which is just about perfect for what it wants to say.|Fresh
This is a very tough movie that does not skimp on either the beauties or horrors of the world of horse-racing.|Fresh
Lean on Pete achieves a visual elegance that grows more expansive and expressive as it goes along.|Fresh
The words in his new film are pungent in themselves, but they're given greater power by Mr. Plummer's remarkable performance.|Fresh
The sense of both transcendent beauty and crushing futility is so all-encompassing that it accidentally infected my own life: Before I remembered I was merely watching a film, I earnestly worried I was doomed.|Fresh
Plummer's performance engenders ... instant sympathy for Charley.|Fresh
Plummer's understated intensity seizes our attention and holds it.|Fresh
Like Haigh's other absorbing dramas, this is a movie that will take root in your imagination and stay there for a while.|Fresh
Lean on Pete becomes a sort of American odyssey.|Fresh
"This is a tough movie to shake, and while it believes in the kindness of strangers, ""Lean on Pete"" never forgets every other human failing, impulse and circumstance."|Fresh
What sustains the movie - and Charley, and the audience - is its faith in the essential innocence of people, even as Haigh looks coolly at the damage they've suffered and the damage they inflict.|Fresh
At the center of this oddly riveting little picaresque is a performance of such quiet power by Plummer - as an antihero both rash and precociously resourceful - that it's easy to overlook the film's flaws.|Fresh
Depending on what you want to read into it, Lean On Pete is about the dangerous ease of hitting rock bottom, about the plight of modern manhood and about the disintegration of the American Dream. Whatever, I liked the horse story best.|Fresh
Authentic, gorgeously photographed, and equipped with the ability to make anyone cry, Lean on Pete is a worthy adaptation of the source material and an intimate portrait of America's underclass|Fresh
Andrew Haigh's deliberate and moving study of a youth adrift with a horse as much in need as he is hits the mark. Charlie Plummer is terrific.|Fresh
Lean on Pete is full of so many themes that will drive the emotions home so it wouldn't be unwise to have a Kleenex handy.|Fresh
In Lean on Pete, we are reminded that human connection, no matter how brief, is essential to our well-being and growth.|Fresh
This is not a movie about a boy and his horse. It is something far more grueling and merciless, and as the film reveals itself in an increasingly jaw-dropping series of vignettes, it's likely to leave you in tatters.|Fresh
Despite the urgency of Charlie's circumstances, Haigh unfolds his story at a purposely patient pace that allows us to bask in grace notes.|Fresh
At his best, [Haigh] can strike more emotional notes from silence than most directors can with a full chorus of sound.|Fresh
In the hands of British filmmaker Andrew Haigh, this tale of a troubled teen (an extraordinary Charlie Plummer) bonding with a horse becomes a heartbreaking look at a marginalized America.|Fresh
Plummer is so good in this role, a young man who refuses to ask for help, insistent on making his own way - watch his face whenever he receives payment for a job well done, the actor flushing with joy at his ability to provide for himself.|Fresh
There is painfully little love, except for the warm and compassionate filmmaking itself, in Andrew Haigh's tender and heartbreaking coming-of-age drama Lean on Pete.|Fresh
Haunting tale of survival and love has language, violence.|Fresh
... provides a compassionate showcase for both its two-legged and four-legged stars, whose moments together convey a genuine poignancy that carries the film through its narrative rough patches.|Fresh
The beauty of Haigh's film resides in going through the meandering, episodic nature and finding poignancy, depth if you will, in its beautifully constructed cracks.|Fresh
As its scenario goes from sad to worse...the movie seems to aspire only to bumming everybody out.|Rotten
When it's at its subtlest, Lean on Pete sings with power; but when things get outwardly grim, it loses a little of its impact.|Fresh
Charlie Plummer, last seen as the kidnappee in All the Money in the World, has a naïf-ish quality and a perilously open face.|Fresh
Tear ducts, saddle up.|Fresh
A very fine movie that I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it, partly because stories about forgotten and mistreated children tend to be reserved for documentaries and foreign-language art cinema.|Fresh
Lean on Pete flows with such gentle beauty that it may be hard to grasp precisely what it's about or where it's going. But the power of this sublime drama is that it can support myriad interpretations while remaining teasingly mysterious.|Fresh
This is a rare drama where spoilers are a real danger; Lean on Pete's rawest, most wrenching moments have a way of skillfully blindsiding viewers, and spoiling any of those would definitely lessen the movie's impact.|Fresh
Plummer is a striking young man with a soulful face and expressive eyes. His performance is heartbreakingly believable.|Fresh
Plummer renders a shockingly good performance, one that moviegoers will look back on as his true breakthrough role.|Fresh
By the end, in its painstakingly observational way, Lean on Pete had devastated me twice and hung me there in a state of tense uncertainty for thirty or forty minutes.|Fresh
A piercing revelation of the ways in which Western culture injures men.|Fresh
As tragic asLean On Peteis, it's also full of exceptionally beautiful moments of connection and sweetness,one of Haigh's specialties.|Fresh
It's hard to watch Lean On Pete without thinking of how different this story would be if Charley were a young woman or a person of color... Still, it's rare to see this type of poverty portrayed onscreen, and Lean On Pete does so effectively...|Fresh
A raw-boned, melancholic mood piece that trades in none of the easy inspiration its poster and trailer might suggest.|Fresh
The story drifts with Charley, in and out of peril, and becomes a doleful picaresque; as his face grows hollow and besmirched, we desperately want him to survive.|Fresh
As sharply as it delineates an America of spotty, informal economies, the film avoids articulating most of the people who live and work in these spaces.|Rotten
Charlie Plummer rocks as a 15-year-old forced to fend for himself and having adventures that few young people could imagine.|Fresh
Charley is the perfect working-class avatar for the white urban NPR listener: the boy is surrounded by poor people but not really one of them, only momentarily corrupted by homelessness and depredation until he finally lands safely in the suburbs.|Rotten
A somber, quixotic trek through a modern West of limited horizons, finite opportunities and the sense that even the young are just playing out their string.|Fresh
Again and again, I marveled at the humanist depth of the world Haigh creates, one that can only be rendered by a truly great writer and director, working near the top of his game.|Fresh
But this movie is all about [Charlie] Plummer's Charley. Go see it, and you'll understand why. The guy has acting chops - in spades.|Fresh
[Charlie Plummer's] character takes your breath away, he's so cowed by the world of the working poor, yet so clearly a potential heroic archetype that his character, Charley, silts itself in your mind long after the final images fade off the screen.|Fresh
Plummer's performance is remarkably interior, bottled up behind his brimming wide eyes, and Haigh leaves enough space for the emotional weight of all that Charley is forced to process.|Fresh
... [Charlie Plummer] brings to mind the young DiCaprio or River Phoenix... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In Lean on Pete, characters are first and foremost, leading to an finished product that is a knockout emotional triumph.|Fresh
As for vérité, there are shades of social realism in Charley's inexorable drift to the margins of America, but damnation and salvation are cinematically situated in a cramped trailer and a well-lit public library, respectively.|Fresh
The film, adapted by Andrew Haigh from Willy Vlautin's 2010 novel, has an urgency for epic things to happen to its main character in the most literal sense.|Rotten
Despite the increased budget and scope, Andrew Haigh's artistry remains low-key and deeply intimate.|Fresh
What should be desperately hard-going is rendered anything but by Haigh's delicate directorial style, an approach complemented by Plummer's appealingly understated performance.|Fresh
Haigh continues to be a treasure worth seeking, and Lean on Pete is one more example of his innate sense of precision and humanity.|Fresh
'Lean on Pete' is a good old-fashioned boy-and-his-horse story, wandering through a series vignettes - each with the inner life and rich characters of a McMurtry short story, each with their own pleasures and curveballs.|Fresh
It's a story that in equal measures is about the treachery of the loss of youth and the importance of retaining some youthful hope.|Fresh
[Lean on Pete] leaves you almost unexpectedly gutted by the deck Charlie's been dealt, but inspired by his resilience.|Fresh
Lean on Pete is a dramatic coming of age story that stands out mainly due to the performance by Charlie Plummer.|Fresh
Haigh has established himself as an artist eminently capable of making incredibly human films about incredibly human pain.|Fresh
Haigh's storytelling is fittingly economical-he doesn't waste a shot, a line of dialogue, an opportunity for a telling detail. His characters, after all, can't afford to waste anything.|Fresh
Adapted from a novel by Willy Vlautin, the film is luminously shot and acted, and, for the most, part beautifully controlled ...|Fresh
"""Lean on Pete"" is a small gem that covers a vast amount of territory."|Fresh
Haigh has rearranged the building blocks of mawkish teen melodrama into a bracing and bittersweet coming-of-age fable.|Fresh
Large portions of Lean on Pete, while exquisitely photographed, are devoted to admiring stunning vistas, but you might be left wondering what happened to the plot.|Fresh
The further Charley gets from the Wenatchee and Portland racetracks, the more unique first half starts to feel pretty darn distant.|Rotten
There's tragedy here, but what's most winning about Lean on Pete is how Haigh never lingers on misery. He's as interested in surprising kindnesses and the goodness of most folks as he is in life's knocks.|Fresh
A standout performance from Plummer makes this thoughtful drama swing.|Fresh
If this story of a lonely young life lived on the hoof leaves us craving stillness and closeness, then surely that's mission accomplished.|Fresh
Rather than a genuine relationship between the animal and the boy, it feels like Charley is projecting his needs onto the animal, who could just as easily be stuffed.|Rotten
Andrew Haigh is not one to shy from painful emotion in his films and Lean on Pete is no exception.|Fresh
"It's particularly refreshing, for those of us for whom the term ""horse movie"" summons a bit of a shudder, that ""Lean On Pete"" almost entirely refutes the idea of the mystical, mutually redemptive soul-mate-style connection between human and equine."|Fresh
There's a wistful quality to the storytelling which softens some of the sharper edges of tragedy and hardship in this undeniably affecting picture.|Fresh
What reads on the surface like an archetypal tale of a boy and his horse becomes an affecting snapshot of the contemporary American underclass in Andrew Haigh's lovely, slow-burning drama, Lean on Pete.|Fresh
Charlie Plummer, 18 playing 15, with the looks of a teenage Christopher Walken, brings great presence to Charley - and we're rooting for him all the way.|Fresh
Haigh's film is never less than heartfelt and affecting. It cares deeply for Charlie and hopes we do, too.|Fresh
It's frustrating to watch, but designed in such a way that the boy's loneliness will haunt long afterward.|Fresh
The maker of such intimate dramas as Weekend and 45 Years brings his gifts as a filmmaker with him to the great outdoors, always capturing little moments of character and emotion even in an expanse of seemingly infinite American desert.|Fresh
