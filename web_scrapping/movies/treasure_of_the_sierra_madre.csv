John Huston has rarely been in better form than in this 1948 study of gold fever and worse obsessions among an unlikely trio of prospectors...|Fresh
There's a quite enjoyable yarn buried under the hollow laughter.|Fresh
The movie has never really been about gold but about character, and Bogart fearlessly makes Fred C. Dobbs into a pathetic, frightened, selfish man -- so sick we would be tempted to pity him, if he were not so undeserving of pity.|Fresh
Greed, a despicable passion out of which other base ferments may spawn, is seldom treated in the movies with the frank and ironic contempt that is vividly manifested toward it in Treasure of Sierra Madre.|Fresh

Huston must have thrown everything he had into this impossibly rich film, packed with grit, passion, adventure and heartbreak.|Fresh
A powerful morality tale whose humour is as black as the heart of its central character, but as humane as the men who survive their brush with greed.|Fresh
