Krisha comes from real pain, a wound that is thoroughly opened up on screen. I can't wait to see what Shults and his aunt do next.|Fresh
Krisha certainly is a difficult film to like or recommend in the traditional sense, but what writer-director Trey Edward Shults has birthed here is something that demands to be seen.|Fresh
Mimicking the one-track mind of addiction, this movie is about Krisha: her humanity, her fear, her actions and their consequences.|Fresh
It's one of the more challenging -- and perhaps rewarding -- film-going experiences of the year so far.|Fresh
If this isn't the first work of a major filmmaker I'll eat my review. And I'll film it for you on YouTube.|Fresh
Among the most engrossing 80-or-so minutes you'll see all year.|Fresh
Tough to stomach, but incredible talent in front of and behind the camera.|Fresh
Krisha is a truly unique film, and one that I'll be thinking about for weeks.|Fresh
The tension is apparent from the off and this tightly wound and intimate drama delivers on both the intensity and complexity of a black sheep returning to the fold.|Fresh
"A family Thanksgiving reunion starts with a flurry of ""so good to see yous"" and ends in expletive-laden recriminations in this brilliantly feel-bad debut from name-to-remember Trey Edward Shults."|Fresh

"A family Thanksgiving reunion starts with a flurry of ""so good to see yous"" and ends in expletive-laden recriminations in this brilliantly feel-bad debut from name-to-remember Trey Edward Shults."|Fresh
A big old family might gather under a single roof in Krisha, but the intriguing indie nonetheless steers clear of home-for-the-holidays formula -- it's more emotional-spiral suspense film than sentimental drama.|Fresh
...as if we're experiencing that most familiar of American traditions-Thanksgiving dinner-through the eyes of an uncomfortable alien.|Fresh
Other than a kitchen catastrophe, there's not a sloppy moment in Trey Edward Shults' micro-budgeted, crowdsourcedKrisha, an incredibly well-constructed debut feature that plays like a home movie gone awry.|Fresh
This is boldly independent work, with more than enough painful, searing drama to leave a mark.|Fresh
Krisha stages these typical festivities with the fury of battling gods.|Fresh
Shot like a creeper of a horror movie, it's intense and focused, seemingly crafted from raw tension, building to boiling catharsis.|Fresh
Ingrained in each scene is a great understanding of every side of addiction, making this family affair into an uncomfortably familiar one for anyone who has dealt with either side of addiction.|Fresh
Shults' greatest ally, and greatest find, is his aunt, Krisha Fairchild. She gives a gritty, lived-in performance brimming with soul and heartache.|Fresh
Unlike most indie movies with intriguing backstories, Krisha stands on its own as a truly great movie, one of the most powerful of the year. (Splice Today)|Fresh
Shults' camera simply, expertly moves with Krisha as she attempts to maneuver her way into a sense of normalcy with -- of belonging to -- her family again.|Fresh
It's raw, unapologetic and in your face.|Fresh
The film has the off-kilter, claustrophobic feel of a horror movie, and on its own terms it's effective.|Fresh
This is no average tale about awkward homecomings. Fairchild is an extraordinary-yet-relatively-unknown actress. And Shults manages to let her character's story come out with shocking clarity and maximum emotional impact.|Fresh
Krisha is an exceptionally well done slow burn that ushers a striking new talent onto the film scene.|Fresh
The director allows us to inhabit not just Krisha's pill-induced zone-out but also her acute distress and, yes, guilt over her past behavior. It's slightly fussy, in-your-face filmmaking, but it's viscerally effective.|Fresh
"""Krisha"" is obviously personal for Shults, but there's a limit to that fact. The film's technique transcends the merely personal."|Fresh
This haunting drama finds new and explosive life in a familiar premise -- a black sheep's return to the family fold for Thanksgiving dinner.|Fresh
[Shults'] from-the-inside-out, humanistic look at an addict confidently veers in tone from drama to comedy to outright horror...|Fresh
"For all its strengths, ""Krisha"" can also be self-indulgent and artificial."|Fresh
Shults coaxes strong performances from everyone, especially Fairchild, who inhabits Krisha with the force of a tornado.|Fresh
"""Krisha"" is harrowing work, diving into the abyss of dysfunction with stunning intimacy and creative confidence from the first-time helmer."|Fresh
Shults does indeed display some giftedness on a visual level, keeping his limited locations interesting with numerous camera tricks and movements. But as calling cards go, Krisha should have remained a short.|Rotten
Krisha is many things: a nightmare, a cry for help, a cringe-comedy with sobbing instead of a laugh track, a cracked family portrait, an apology and a valentine.|Fresh
Shults is a penetrating observer, and hints at many old wounds that will be lanced in the course of a tight 83 minutes.|Fresh
Shults builds a creeping sense of dread with the same anxious naturalism that the late indie auteur John Cassavetes brought to such films as A Woman Under the Influence.|Fresh
The confident low-budget visuals and unflinching attention to sensory details add an unsettling layer of tension to the proceedings that sticks with you afterward.|Fresh
An explosive, stomach-knotting debut.|Fresh
The film excels in navigating the actual space of a family get together.|Fresh
The film feels like a blazing catharsis for all involved.|Fresh
There is hell to come in Krisha, but the artist stands back from the anger - and forgives.|Fresh
"A coiled masterpiece of subjective filmmaking, writer-director Trey Edward Shults' ""Krisha"" is, in the well-worn genre of ruined family holidays, something of an indie gauntlet thrown down."|Fresh
"Few movies bore into a character's head as deeply as ""Krisha,"" and with such uncompromising ferocity."|Fresh
This is well-worn territory, but in the right hands the primal family drama bears infinite repeating.|Fresh
Proves less can often provide opportunities for so much more.|Fresh
At once familiar and sui generis, specific and universal, it thoroughly reworks what could have been a thumb-twiddling family saga into something unique and gutting.|Fresh
Unfolding across an especially long and awkward Thanksgiving Day, Krisha creates an audio-visual language of social anxiety; it's practically a horror movie about the horror of being the unwanted guest at the party.|Fresh
Despite the familiarity of its conceit, this is a bold debut feature.|Fresh
Shults is telling a personal story here, but he's also wisely drawing on a familiar set of tropes, ones that implicate the audience in all sorts of interesting ways.|Fresh
It is a bravura debut from a young film-maker, proving that one can still make a movie for no money at a family member's house and come away with a work of art, not just a calling card.|Fresh
You've seen the plot before, but not quite like this.|Fresh
Trey Edward Shults hardly turns the dark family drama genre on its head, Krisha compensates with exceptional acting and an infectious atmosphere of dread.|Fresh
Krisha is bold and powerful. This Great American Indie will knock you on your ass in the best possible way.|Fresh
"Brash yet intimate, writer/director/editor Trey Edward Shults's observant, unnerving first feature transcends the notion of a ""promising debut."""|Fresh
Shults displays a bold visual and dramatic sensibility with his impressionistic rearrangement of time and his repertory of darting, whirling, plunging, and retreating camera moves, which seem to paint the action onto the screen.|Fresh
It rams home the main character's relentless downward spiral though an incessant parade of grandstanding stylistic flourishes.|Rotten
Curious indie drama/comedy.|Fresh
An intimate and unnerving character study that marks a ferociously impressive feature debut for 26-year-old multihyphenate Trey Edward Shults.|Fresh
A jittery character drama which mixes tones and influences, the feature debut of writer-director-editor Trey Edward Shults does a very good job of finding fresh emotional terrain in what is a very familiar setup.|Fresh
Trey Edward Shults is hardly the first filmmaker to use the all-American Thanksgiving get-together to expose family anxieties. But with Krisha, his extraordinary debut feature, he brings a bracing originality to a familiar setup.|Fresh
For some, watching a movie like this can be hard, but Shults does the audience the favor of attacking his story head on. His unflinching eye gives us a cathartic view of the very real pain that can exist in domestic life troubled by addiction.|Fresh
The final shot once again turns the story over to the contours of Krisha's face and the shades of emotional ambiguity conveyed by it. The uncertainties that define her existence are as riveting as they are tragic.|Fresh
The film's brief 83-minute running time only compounds Krishna as a sharp breath with no exhale; shot and paced like a thriller, the film is a dreamlike view into a woman's inner life that ensures a tragic end.|Fresh
The winner of the grand jury award for narrative features at SXSW, Trey Edward Shults's writing and directing debut, Krisha, is an emotional gut punch of a film.|Fresh
This is one of those rare films that shows what it really means to get old.|Fresh
This indie has verve to spare and features a razor-sharp cast that's largely nonprofessional.|Fresh
