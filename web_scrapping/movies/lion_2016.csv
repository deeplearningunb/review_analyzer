Ultimately, a messy structure and jittery pacing leaves Lion feeling incoherent, with characters and subplots falling out of view as the film races towards an admittedly tearjerking end.|Rotten
Lion, for the scope of its narrative and breadth of its ambitions, is not something that could be adequately told in 120 minutes.|Rotten
Lion is as poignant of a film as it is wholly due to Pawar's unique ability to draw audiences in and captivate their hearts, a talent few adults - let alone children - have.|Fresh
Lion is to adoption stories as rom-coms are to genuine romantic love: manipulative and sentimental....|Rotten
The final resolution doesn't disappoint. Director Garth Davis...handles the emotions in a way that is satisfying and unsentimental.|Fresh
The kind of film that roars with emotion, even if it isn't always hitting the mark.|Fresh
Davis' direction is fairly assured, painting a convincing panorama of both India and (to a lesser extent) Australia as they are seen through Saroo's eyes, so in that sense the film is able to transcend some of its prestige trappings.|Fresh
I would've liked the movie a lot more if it remained focused on the struggle for Saroo to find his cultural identity as opposed to his extensive searching of Google Earth.|Fresh
It's emotionally compelling first half helmed by a powerful performance by Sunny Pawar drastically deteriorates into a middle of the road indie drama in the second.|Rotten
I felt like the directing was understated...just trying its best to tell a good story, and to communicate as effectively as possible. It's a great movie.|Fresh

It's a heart-wrenching puzzle full of scant clues and seemingly insurmountable obstacles.|Fresh
Director Garth Davis... takes his time with the (true) story, flashing back and forth from today to all those years ago.|Fresh
Extraordinary performances, particularly from young Pawar, Patel and Kidman, create a memorable and emotional story of family, identity and the need we all have to not only be loved, but to belong.|Fresh
The story is thorough at first, but doesn't maintain a constant emotional balance throughout. However, its ending is so satisfying and moving that certain flaws can be overlooked.|Fresh
Leans on simplistic cause and effect to create heightened emotional tension... Histrionic narrative potholes involving Saroo's love interest make Lion even chunkier and dishonest.|Rotten
The first and second half of the film feel disjointed and the soundtrack is jarring - what started off as a really interesting and non linear biopic falls flat.|Rotten
Lion is an electrifying journey that creates a vast emotional scope on screen and undoubtedly, an abundance of tears that will be hard to hide from your neighbor.|Fresh
Adoption is used a plot point in a lot of movies, but it is rarely explored this well...Here it's about also exploring why the people who raised you are equally important.|Fresh
I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's this much about the experience of adoption and the relation between adoptive parents and adopted children...it's a rich subject that we don't see much in film.|Fresh
Lion may be based on a true story, but even so, it should be praised for the matter-of-factness in which it tells its story. There's very little that I felt was dramatised for the sake of a moving picture.|Fresh
Whatever issues I may have with the mise-en-sc√®ne, I was still deeply affected by the drama, and I expect others to be, as well.|Fresh
Director Garth Davis taps into a Saroo's childhood memories to create a delicate link to his new life and give him reason to hope.|Fresh

Give it a chance, for not only is it an emotionally powerful experience, but Lion is the rare movie that can transform your view of the world we live in.|Fresh
Photographer Greig Fraser's landscapes of Saroo's two worlds are extremely handsome.|Fresh
Lion is a beautiful and moving film made all the more compelling because it is a true story ... make sure to bring your tissues.|Fresh
As much a parable as a drama, Lion quietly explores a social problem while staying strongly focused on its intimacies.|Fresh
What it does , quite beautifully, is make a case for a common - and borderless - humanity. The strength and love that uphold families is palpable and powerful. Be sure and stay for the credits and have a hanky ready.|Fresh
...sends the audience on an epic adventure.|Fresh
The picture does take a few exciting bold risks in act one, however, the rest of the movie plays out like a straightforward cable TV movie.|Rotten
Sad yet uplifting, frightening yet inspirational, Lion breaks your heart into a thousand pieces and puts them back together in the end. It makes you believe in miracles and embrace hardships by celebrating courage and resilience in its own unique way.|Fresh
This one's a gem of a film. One that takes an already spectacular story and turns it into an absolute sublime experience. Those multiple Oscar nominations are much deserved.|Fresh
The ending is predictably lovely but it might have been lovelier still if we'd got there faster.|Fresh
The beats aren't anything new; the value is in the execution, and that's great.|Fresh
Lion stirs emotions, but the storytelling is straightforward, not cloying.|Fresh
Director Garth Davis' film Lion sits squarely in the category of real-life stories that are more astonishing than any fiction.|Fresh
These actors could have tackled much more difficult terrain, with grace and intelligence, had Davies and Davis given them the opportunity.|Rotten
What Lion does is take a culturally rich story and apply the conventions of middlebrow Western, feel-good cinematic storytelling.|Rotten
"The movie's messages are thoughtfully and honestly communicated -- particularly the idea that ""home"" can mean more than any one place, person or even culture."|Fresh
The rest of the movie, which includes a big plug for Google Maps, concerns Saroo's search for his roots. Or, more likely, Patel's on-going search for a Hollywood career.|Rotten

Lion is an astounding, all-encompassing story of hope, determination and dumb luck that will leave you both crying like a baby and clapping like a seal once the credits roll.|Fresh
[It's] alternately emotionally wrenching and veering on the sentimental. But it never reduces itself to mawkishness so, by the end, we are rewarded for having seen it.|Fresh
The film sometimes has no strict thematic focus, but that's fine. Neither does life.|Fresh
An emotional and well-acted film, which ends up giving a valuable message about child abuse in India, showing us real images of Saroo and his family. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An emotional film that will make the viewer shed a tear, without being manipulative. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
At times sentimental but never maudlin, Lion is an inspiring slice-of-life odyssey.|Fresh
In Lion, Patel sheds his tendency to play his characters broadly. But Pawar easily eclipses his efforts.|Fresh
A painful story where guilt and restlessness harass the main characters because of a fateful mix between their decisions and uncertainty. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Thank God Lion exists. We need more films like it, like Slumdog, to shame us into being better by showing us our worst, and to inspire us into being brave, by showing us our best.|Fresh

A melodrama that overflows in its final part, which reserves moments of a valuable intensity. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Those expecting the usual exoticised version of India will be surprised by the brutal, neo-realist way it's portrayed.|Fresh
The many flaws of Lion overshadow its few strengths, resulting in a disjointed film that's uneven in both tone and quality.|Rotten
Endless scenes of Patel frowning at a laptop screen also prove decidedly uncinematic, and awareness of the story's tear-jerking happy ending erases any potential for tension.|Rotten
The based on fact story is a can't miss emotional powerhouse, which manages to overcome some subplots that seem to be time-filling sidetracks.|Fresh

"In a way, ""Lion"" is a better film than even ""Slumdog"" in that its intimate focus and emotionally engaging story should play deeper and resonate more broadly."|Fresh
Some films are simply great stories and nothing more. Lion is one such example of this, although its treatment leaves a bit to be desired.|Fresh
Patel brilliantly portrays a young man adrift in a sea of uncertainty towards his identity, haunted by a past he barely survived and guilt ridden over loving a family he barely knew.|Fresh
What may well have been a reflection on the moral poverty of the world, soon becomes an irritating melodrama. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
A conventional film with strong tendencies towards being tearful and musical. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Lion's emotional strength lies in its honest approach to adoption, to the feeling of the adoptee and the one adopted, to the stuck pieces, to the inevitable emptiness of not knowing where we come from and who we are. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An estimable film, especially during its first hour, and that has sufficient virtues that makes it worth to take a look at it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The movie's first half is filled with tumult, menace and a vivid sense of place; the second half, which emphasizes the idea that the comfortable and well-educated Saroo is a 'lost' soul (literally), is tedious.|Rotten
The movie mostly succeeds in grounding the hard to believe in easy to comprehend circumstances and readily real emotion. It's not a great film, but it's effective in how it sets up and satisfies a life-changing tale.|Fresh
"""Lion"" isn't revolutionary filmmaking, but as comfort food cinema goes, it carries requisite anxiety and release, making it palatable to the mass audience while still retaining some subtlety with periodically intense character examination."|Fresh
Lion is a feel-good story that works best when it uses the visual language of cinema to map such inner worlds onto outer ones.|Fresh
[Pawar is] remarkably natural and heart-rendingly real, and offers one of the best child performances in years in a very demanding role.|Fresh
Lion starts strong and finishes on a teary high, with its comparatively lesser moments buoyed by the presence of Patel.|Fresh
Unhurried in pace, subtle in tone and simple in structure, this moving, compassionate film engages with the age-old theme of finding one's place in the world, yet through uniquely 21st Century means.|Fresh
Lion does exactly what it needs to make hearts soar and tears swell. It might do so in a standard fashion, but, boy does it do it well.|Fresh
The award-baiting performances are really good and it is beautifully shot by cinematographer Greig Fraser.|Fresh
Your heart is made of Satan's teeth if you don't come away with dusty eyes and a warm feeling.|Fresh
If you don't blub at the end, you may wish to secede from the human species.|Fresh
You don't need to have adopted a child, or to have been adopted yourself (although I was, as it happens), to find Lion immensely moving. All you need is a heart.|Fresh
A deeply empathetic performance from Dev Patel and an unflinching view of child poverty on the streets of Calcutta provide a winning edge to Lion.|Fresh
Drab and predictable.|Rotten
Lion may not roar but it does have a big heart.|Fresh
Google Earth has blind spots and so does Lion. Still, it covers an awful lot of ground and the views are stunning.|Fresh
Has some pacing issues and an overbearing score, but nothing that isn't erased by the swelling, tear-jerking crescendo of an ending.|Fresh
The director, Garth Davis, gets strong performances from his cast -- a heart-to-heart scene between Patel and Kidman looks set to earn them both Oscar nominations.|Fresh
Robustly made, but very little to gnaw on.|Rotten
Lion is yet another seemingly inclusive film that does little more than pander to its target white audience.|Rotten
If this was a two minute commercial for Google Earth, you'd be bawling your eyes out. But stretched to two hours, you find yourself looking at your watch.|Fresh
To say that Davis doesn't complicate Lion is meant as a compliment, relying as he does instead on some excellent playing, from Patel and Kidman especially.|Fresh
With a story this strong, you can't really go wrong and director Garth Davis provides a sure guiding hand with Saroo's barely believable story unfolding largely in chronological order.|Fresh
This is the sort of true story that catches you unawares, even if you know (or think you know) where it's going.|Fresh
Though there are shades of Slumdog Millionaire in its gripping depiction of a young boy thrown by fate onto the streets of India, this affecting true story still has plenty to offer.|Fresh
Lion is a beguiling piece of storytelling.|Fresh
This big-hearted film does full justice to the horror, the pathos and the drama of his postmodern odyssey.|Fresh
A carefully grafted and artfully conceived big-screen adaptation of a truly astonishing story which is both a tearjerker and a crowd-pleaser, without being a sell-out.|Fresh
Don't think about stepping into the theatre without a good supply of tissues.|Fresh
Middlebrow mediocrity served up by the Weinsteins on a silver platter for awards season.|Rotten
Director Garth Davis and screenwriter Luke Davies throw all the soap suds at the story.|Rotten
Director Garth Davis and screenwriter Luke Davies have delivered the tasteful version, one that avoids practically all the story's potential [bombastic, sensational, sentimental] landmines in lieu of honest emotion. It is a film of great integrity.|Fresh
If the second section of Lion is no match for the first, none of its obvious flaws (most notably, disjointed scripting and more than a few plot holes) detract from the intense emotional connection forged with the viewer throughout.|Fresh
A bittersweet variation on the 'I was lost, but now I'm found' theme of the parable of the Prodigal Son.|Fresh
The film is moving enough in its own terms but lacks the depth and complexity that might have been expected.|Fresh
An astonishing true story that's treated with an admirably light and artistic touch, rather than an overly dramatic heavy hand.|Fresh
The source material is so rich that it's easy to forgive Lion's small flaws when the film treats its characters with such empathy.|Fresh
It's a miraculous tale, though one that relies heavily on a device filmmakers have struggled to make cinematic: staring at a computer for long stretches.|Fresh
Davis' debut is a touch over-stretched but impossible to resist - a classy crowd-pleaser with an especially magical first half.|Fresh
By turns tragic, deeply moving and heartfelt.|Fresh
An old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing film that succeeds on its own admittedly less-than-ambitious terms.|Fresh
Loss and belonging are the themes of this incredible true story; it is the simplicity of the storytelling that brings it to life. Most crucial is the establishment of the Indian reality|Fresh
"Powerful. That is how I'd best describe ""Lion."""|Fresh
Crucial to these early scenes is the casting of Sunny Pawar, a marvellously instinctive child actor who gives an indelible performance as Saroo.|Fresh
Director Garth Davis' debut feature is an inspiring and uplifting story based on the memoir penned by Saroo Brierley, A Long Way Home.|Fresh
...an interesting story told relatively well...|Fresh
Lion offers a tale that is incredibly unique and yet, at the same time, utterly universal.|Fresh
You can start 2017 with positive vibes.|Fresh
Director Gareth Davis has pulled it together for a tale of two countries, two cities and two lives twenty years apart.|Fresh
It's a well-told and engaging tale that's all the more remarkable in that it's based on a true story. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Great performances abound, mixing with some magnificent photography to form one of the premier family dramas of 2016.|Fresh
The picture is maybe too frontloaded but the acting delivers in the final stretch.|Fresh

It's the intimate, uplifting drama you've been yearning for...|Fresh
Only the most shrivel-hearted grinch could watch this Christmas release and not be moved.|Fresh
This is awards-season bait aimed straight at your sentimental side that loves a good tearjerker and one which earns most of the tears that it jerks.|Fresh
Lion is not an easy journey, but it is a thoughtful, worthwhile and ultimately inspiring experience.|Fresh
Where Lion gets its power, though, is in the first half and the stunning performance by Pawar.|Fresh
[A] tale of tragedy and loss, of pain and heartbreak -- but also a tale of hope and mercy, of faith & love, and of how sublime moments of grace in our lives can often come from the aftermath of suffering.|Fresh
Lion roars quietly with restraint and simplicity.|Fresh
If you're searching for fulfilling feel-good entertainment, the royal 'Lion' exceeds expectations.|Fresh
The final scenes, when the action returns to India, can't help but pack an emotional punch because it recalls that vastly superior first act when we fell in love with Saroo.|Fresh
Designed to be a crowd-pleaser, but after a turbulent, heart-wrenching first act, the second-meant to be touchingly uplifting-instead comes across as rather shallow and pedestrian by comparison.|Rotten
...This story of a small boy lost in a sprawling land finds truly epic proportions, not because it's trying to go big, but exactly the opposite: it's determined to find meaning in the beings, things and feelings we often deem too small to matter.|Fresh
A heartwarming true-life tale.|Fresh
Wonderfully Inspiring Movie - not to miss|Fresh
Amounts to the third film in an unofficial trilogy: The Long Journey From India in Search of an Oscar Movie. (Splice Today)|Fresh
Lion literally earns every heartstring tug with its impossible story of rediscovering ones childhood with the help of cutting-edge technology and good, old-fashioned resolve.|Fresh
Patel, best remembered from Slumdog Millionaire, shows a real, full-blooded star quality here, miles removed from the humble hero of that 2008 film.|Fresh
This is a lovely saga of roots and identity.|Fresh
Davis and screenwriter Luke Davies aggressively strum the heartstrings, but the film falters as it focuses more on product placement than people.|Rotten
A sincere celebration of determination and the human spirit, this film will have you applauding and weeping simultaneously.|Fresh
The emotional impact of Lion is sneaky.|Fresh
Garth Davis uses close-ups sparingly and hits no false notes; cinematographer Greig Fraser creates a child's perspective by setting the camera at the hero's eye level and conveys the grandeur of India through sweeping panoramic and overhead shots.|Fresh
An exciting, old-school explorer's tale well told (for the most part).|Fresh
"Truth-based lost-and-found stories such as ""Lion"" usually feature dogs or cats. Here, though, it's the rather slow, if moving tale of a poor, 5-year-old Indian boy who falls asleep in a train station and winds up more than 1,500 miles from home."|Fresh
"""Lion"" has one of those plot lines that feels like a Hollywood screenplay - except it actually happened."|Fresh
While the film is neither novel nor revolutionary, it's the kind of cinematic warm blanket that feels very comforting and satisfying right now...That it's a true story...makes it all the more affecting.|Fresh
It's incredible that it has taken this long to put an August Wilson play on the screen. This movie redresses that, and its performances are wholly worthy of such a quintessentially American playwright. We're privileged to have them.|Fresh
An emotionally satisfying and ultimately a warm and well-told international adventure of the heart.|Fresh
The story you're watching here stretches credibility the singular way that true stories can. It's the fruition of a search that couldn't possibly have succeeded the way it did but did so anyway.|Fresh
The true story that will elicit your empathy through the miracles in the life of a man who goes on a quest to locate his birth family.|Fresh
If you don't cry at the conclusion you need to retrieve your heart out of cold storage.|Fresh

An inspiring drama that earns tears without jerking them.|Fresh
Lion, although a little jumbled in its second half, has everything you need from a poignant, awards-preying drama, with the story offering plenty of moments of both beauty and sadness.|Fresh
Lion can't avoid seeming lesser in the second half after Davis' mesmeric first but it's solid storytelling nonetheless.|Fresh
Lion celebrates the human will and the human need to find meaning and connection in life. If the final scenes don't have you blubbering, your humanity may need some fine-tuning.|Fresh
As the protagonist in the first and stronger half, pint-sized powerhouse Sunny Pawar wins the hearts and tears ducts of the audience. He's a tough act to follow.|Fresh
Immensely powerful, inspiring, and impossible to forget.|Fresh
What do you call a movie that has a great first act and a moving finale but bogs down on the way to that conclusion? In this case, you call it Lion. I say this with regret, because the true story it tells is remarkable and it's a shame the film is flawed|Fresh
...grabs you by the throat from its first frames and never lets you go.|Fresh
It could roar if it wanted to, but settles for an expressive, almost infrasonic growl.|Fresh
Davis offers sweeping cinematic shots, with a soundtrack that is pleasingly epic, but the second act is a bit skimpy, script-wise.|Fresh
Unless you are an utterly immovable cynic, the Australian melodrama Lion will coax out tears of sadness and of pure joy.|Fresh
Rarely does a film plotting the Internet amount to much more than a series of glowing screens. Lion, a fact-based story and auspicious feature debut by Garth Davis, makes for a captivating exception.|Fresh
If you think there's still room for the traditional 'true-story' drama, Lion proves these stories still have a little life left in them.|Fresh
The final reel, of course, is deeply affecting. But you knew that going in, didn't you?|Fresh
Because of Patel's electrifying and deeply nuanced performance, Lion ultimately delivers the emotional punch it has promised all along.|Fresh
Lion is an emotional corker of a true story that charts a remarkable journey that redefines the meaning of family and home.|Fresh
Lion tells one of those amazing true stories that only a pure cynic could fail to be captivated by.|Fresh
Be warned: Lion will reduce you to a sniffling wreck.|Fresh
Director Garth Davis has taken this incredible, real life tale and made an emotionally involving film that pulls on your heartstrings every step of the way.|Fresh
Great performances in emotional, intense biographical drama.|Fresh
The film ends with that contemporary movie rarity-an authentic and overwhelming display of gratitude.|Fresh
"""Lion"" is a good calling card for the new director [Garth Davis]"|Fresh
Patel easily grows to fill the needs of this complex and conflicted character, a man caught between two worlds, two cultures and two families.|Fresh
An inspiring story of cruel fate, cruel people, the kindness of strangers and childhood traumas that we never forget|Fresh
See it and I promise your own heart will skip a beat with happiness and joy.|Fresh
Lion is really two beautifully shot films -- the tenacious story of young Saroo Brierley, lost far from home, and the less dramatic, slightly forced, story of him all grown up and looking for his past.|Fresh
Lion is ultimately an excellent example of its type-a resonant true story told, not with manipulative cliches, but with refreshing confidence.|Fresh
This frustrating film begins with artful evocations of Dickensian squalor and turns into a movie about a guy staring at a laptop.|Rotten
The trite tropes are thick but Saroo's drama remains undramatized and we remain mostly unmoved.|Rotten
Kudos to Kidman, whose unglam, unguarded take on the role is emotionally powerful and true; her scenes with Patel provide just the right blend of grit and grace. Lion is one from the heart.|Fresh
Lion ... becomes ordinary, even as it moves toward a climax that's moving for all the predictable reasons.|Rotten
The finale is manipulative in every way, squeezing out the emotions of the audience. But Lion's well-plotted narrative and thoughtful characters suck you in so much that the journey there is totally worth it.|Fresh
Let's just say if you are human, there is no way that Lion won't move you.|Fresh
"""Lion"" is blessed with a Ripley's Believe It or Not story line that would warm the heart of a stone."|Fresh
If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child - or a mother - this movie will wreck you.|Fresh
"This seems exactly the kind of ""based on true events"" tale that filmmakers go gaga for...The plotting lurches, bound by reality, making for a muddled though moving affair."|Fresh
The movie could have examined the limitations of white liberalism, the damage that well-meaning people can do if they don't educate themselves along the way. Instead, it embodies that well-meaning approach, and all the harm it can do.|Rotten
Lion is moving, beautifully shot, and clear-eyed about its aims. It's the kind of inspirational movie even a film snob could love.|Fresh
Mr. Patel's commanding presence is complemented by many others... Kidman has done fine work in her career, but nothing that quite matches the hypnotic story Sue tells of a vision she had when she was 12.|Fresh
Anchored by an impossibly adorable new talent and a familiar face showing new dramatic range, Lion explores the power of memory, technology and the pull of home.|Fresh
Lion may be a little too Oscar-bait-y, but it's not without loud emotional roars.|Fresh
You'll try your best to hold back the tears, only to find yourself incapable of not being thoroughly moved by Saroo's journey.|Fresh
Lion goes again and again where you expect it to, delivering little more than the awards-season equivalent of Homeward Bound.|Rotten
By the film's climax -- even if you know how it will end -- viewers should be a blubbering mess.|Fresh
We've watched this young man struggle and fight for answers, only to have them drop into his lap at precisely the right moment. It's a drastic misstep that ruins whatever chance Lion had of doing justice to a fascinating true story.|Rotten
Lion's faults of structure and pacing might limit its power, but in stretches it still roars.|Fresh
Lion is one of those rare films which effortlessly manages to put us inside the heads of protagonists and make us believe that their reality is our reality too.|Fresh
By splitting up the story into different eras of the hero's life, Davis seems to be striving to avoid some of the conventions of melodrama. But coloring within the lines might have done a couple of favors to his actors and the flow of his film.|Fresh
Ditch the cynicism; take the Kleenex.|Fresh
Here's a globe-trotting boy-on-his-own adventure, a narrative of scrappy survival and familial love and many teary reconciliations, tracing the outlines of Brierley's life in a busy two hours.|Fresh
...it misses the mark on the duality-Saroo goes from forgetting his past completely to suddenly being all about it, and it's a lot more complicated than that|Fresh
A strong and emotionally fulfilling interpretation of a true event that seems stranger than fiction.|Fresh
This is a true story, and at times a gut-wrenching one, even if it necessarily sugarcoats some aspects of the plight of lost children.|Fresh
Where Saroo goes and what he finds there left me in tears, but you feel that a complicated true story has been airbrushed into a postmodern legend.|Fresh
Davis's film is based on a true story; though wrenching, there is barely enough of it to fill the dramatic space, and the second half is a slow and muted affair after the Dickensian punch of the first.|Rotten
Patel's constant anger and destitution get a bit tedious, but the uplifting ending will move even the most stoic movie-goer to tears.|Fresh
If you've ever been lost, and who hasn't? This movie is for you, featuring a five-year-old boy from India who winds up in Australia.|Fresh
"The trajectory ""Lion"" takes isn't surprising‚Äîit is quite inevitable, actually‚Äîbut the film's centerpiece true account is respectful and, ultimately, heartening."|Fresh
In his feature film debut, director Garth Davis creates a formally riveting and emotionally shattering look into the complexities of family and the ache of separation.|Fresh
Lion plays safe more often than necessary, but it definitely roars when it counts.|Fresh
The characters are wonderfully rounded and each performer brings them to screen with such a sense of realism that you can't help but feel both moved and inspired.|Fresh
Dev Patel's most sophisticated and touching performance to date helps hold things together as he expertly portrays Saroo's inner conflict and identity crisis.|Fresh
Obviously an extraordinary experience for the real-life protagonists, but for the movie viewer not so much.|Rotten
Involves no one you've ever heard of, doesn't star a soul you'll recognise for its first 40 minutes, and will rip you into a thousand pieces.|Fresh
Lion is a triumphant celebration of the beauty of the human spirit.|Fresh
Richly produced but somewhat inert.|Fresh
A terrific true-life tale packed with great performances.|Fresh
True story or not, there is no denying that Lion is a largely empty film. A paint-by-numbers production, Lion is following a simple set of instructions for achieving an emotional response from its audience.|Rotten
An emotional film that connects with the audience and resembles those epic films full of sentimentalism. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hopefully Lion will be the film that proves [Patel's] leading man capabilities and also shines a line on just how nuanced and charismatic he is in a role written well.|Fresh
Even as it drags through a pedestrian middle section, Lion remains a cut above the kind of sturdy middlebrow drama its premise calls to mind by doubling down on Patel's performance.|Fresh
Davis' talent feels hammered down by Luke Davies' screenplay adaptation that ultimately meanders around until it comes to a lackluster halt.|Rotten
It's an earnest but not cloying film, one that seems wise about the world and its alternately grim and encouraging complexity.|Fresh
You will cry during the greatest Google Maps commercial ever made. Maybe bring a tissue.|Fresh
Because it is a true story we may know exactly where Lion is heading but that does nothing to lessen the impact of a film that deals so eloquently with loss, love and our understanding of family.|Fresh
