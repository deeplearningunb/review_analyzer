Rather, Summer 1993 is less family melodrama and more a love letter to childhood and to the parents who shape it.|Fresh

Summer 1993 is a quiet, tender character study focused on its young protagonist, her youthful existence in a state of flux following the death of her mother.|Fresh
In one form or another, we can all relate to some childhood experience shared by the film's two young protagonists. An ingenious portrait of family, heartbreak, and belonging.|Fresh
Simón's loving replication of the past is anchored in a bevy of lush greens and warm tans, with the sounds of domestic and outdoor life coming through with a keen vitality.|Fresh
The four actors did extended improvisations as a family before the film shoot began and the chemistry they developed shows; they have a convincing intimacy together.|Fresh

This is a slow, quiet film of gentle revelation. Come to see the debut feature of a promising filmmaker, armed with patience, a sense of discovery, and, if possible, your own inner child.|Fresh

Curly-haired newcomer Laia Artigas, only eight when this was made, holds her own against an experienced adult cast.|Fresh
Children's natural affinity for pretending, their trusting nature and an unquestioning ability to accept their circumstances make them naturals in front of the camera. First-time director Carla Simón Pipó has made something amazing here.|Fresh
...a wonderfully honest and gracefully directed insight into the world of children.|Fresh
An autobiographical character piece with an edge of real pain and bewilderment.|Fresh
Frida's gaze governs everything, taking you back to the mysteries, the insecurities - and the joys - of being six.|Fresh
...a testament to what cinema can achieve...|Fresh
Summer 1993 is, at its core, a sad, potentially tragic tale of emotional survival. It meanders. It ends almost randomly. But the truth of its emotions sticks in the mind.|Fresh
Emotional without ever being mawkish it is atmospheric, you can feel the still heat, and brilliantly directed and acted.|Fresh
The story is quietly realistic and, though my main response was simply to wonder how Simon obtained such natural performances from the children, the overall effect is beguiling.|Fresh
Summer 1993 is a heart-wrenching triumph that gives full dues to the complexity of childhood trauma, as well as human fallibility.|Fresh
A deeply personal child's-eye view of loss, Summer 1993 is an utterly beguiling debut feature from Spanish writer-director Carla Simón.|Fresh
It's a profoundly humanistic film, bringing home powerfully the sheer achievement of parenthood, as well as how the surrounding society comes through to show its implicit tolerance...|Fresh
The film wears its story lightly. Even when Simón is dealing with heavier themes her focus is on Frida and her emotions.|Fresh
In its subtlety, richness and warmth it is entirely beguiling - complex and simple at the same time. It is also very moving.|Fresh
The film doesn't detour or disturb, doesn't serpentine or surprise, as great cinema can. It just puts everything on the thematic picnic plate and tells us to get eating.|Fresh

A slow-moving summer, but one worth seeing through.|Fresh
The children's acting is inspired.|Fresh
Simon obtains entirely credible performances from the movie's children.|Fresh
Summer 1993 is provocative, both for the raw depth of the emotions it evokes and the directness of its storytelling.|Fresh
It's a loosely defined movie, but its emotions are honest and its observance of child behavior remarkably accurate.|Fresh
Not to give anything away, but its climax just may wrench your heart - though, if you're open to the experience, it'll happen in a good way.|Fresh
Essential to the film's success is the authenticity of the two young girls. Both are amazing naturals, most of the time behaving as if they are totally unaware that there is a camera present.|Fresh
Summer 1993 is a film that reminds me why I love the medium. By the final scene, it's both a love letter and a gut punch, and it's a tiny, enormous wonder.|Fresh

A poignant tale of tragic loss, bewildering anger and finding love through tears.|Fresh
This modest, quiet, deeply felt movie comes through in the end.|Fresh
Artigas and Robles are utterly spellbinding for the entirety of Summer 1993's runtime. Their pure joy feels improvised, captured in the moment by Simón's camera.|Fresh
Garnering incredibly natural and endearing performances from her 7 year-old star and 4 year-old Paula Robles as her cousin Anna, Simón's astute direction reveals the psychological reactions of a child entrusted to the unfamiliar.|Fresh
It is clear that Simón shows promise but this is clearly her first feature and there is room for growth.|Fresh
Child performances don't always land, but when they do they can be astonishing and unexpected. Laia Artigas' rendering of Frida is a truly remarkable feat, perhaps in the ranks of 8-year-old Brooklynn Prince's star role in The Florida Project last year.|Fresh
Summer 1993 is the classic foreign, indie film about a little girl coping with loss, which admittedly is not for everyone. Simple story, no big studio glitz-and-glamor and an emotional payoff at the end the works for the most part.|Fresh
Tender and evocative, this quietly powerful coming-of-age drama takes a naturalistic approach.|Fresh
Gently paced but not slow, plot-thin yet not uneventful, Summer 1993 feels like a moving letter written by an adult to a much younger self, imbued with the peculiar sadness at the realization the recipient will never be able to read it.|Fresh
For such a seemingly small story, set almost entirely in one location, it's extraordinary how high the stakes are raised, making the final catharsis ... a true release of emotion.|Fresh
Ultimately, this is a memorable look at our desire to love and feel safe, to connect and belong - and the unexpected ways in which families can reshape and grow.|Fresh
A superbly crafted, autobiographical look at a seminal season in the filmmaker's childhood.|Fresh
Throughout [Simon] completely absorbs the viewer in this portrait drawn from her memories, painting a picture of Spain caught up in AIDS era disinformation that's also an evocation of childhood doubts.|Fresh
The outburst at its heart will surprise you as much as the characters-and it's so expertly played, you may feel as if you're watching a documentary.|Fresh
Movingly understated and beautifully acted.|Fresh
Rather than adopt an excuse to turn this hardship material into easy sentiment, Simón treats this very personal matter with a focused, unhurried wisdom for the ways even a left-turn girlhood can still be a celebration of being young, alive, and open.|Fresh
The uncanny performance of Laia Artigas as Frida, who appears in every scene, holds Simon's movie together.|Fresh

An extraordinary and beautiful work of grief and memory.|Fresh
Simón succeeds in creating a rich, vivid world from her own turbulent pre-adolescence, though the film does meander in a way that makes its deeply personal nature unmistakable.|Fresh
The film's screenplay is impressive for how crucial plot points emerge as backdrops to the explicit purpose of a scene.|Fresh
"Perfectly natural performances from two little girls anchor a tale that virtually has the caption ""memoir"" in the subtitles. A solid feature-length freshman entry from the writer-director."|Fresh
Summer 1993 stands out for its subtle, touching, but never sentimentalist approach to this exceedingly sensitive theme, the childhood apprehension of personal tragedy...|Fresh

It's rare to encounter a movie starring children where the emotional range is so vast, so natural, that I question hte acting method of some adults. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
What makes Summer 1993 a great little film is modesty; the way in which it eludes almost all low blows and demagogic temptations that this type of story usually offers. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

Finding the right audience may be difficult, but this delicate sleeper is worth the effort.|Fresh
Simon's debut is both tender and determined as it relates a tale of a young orphan trying to fit in with a new family.|Fresh
A thoughtful and moving family portrait.|Fresh
