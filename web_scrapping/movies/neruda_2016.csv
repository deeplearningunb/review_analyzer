It's much more interested in examining the meaning self, how system of belief shape our existence regardless whether or not we conform. I'll take that over a generic biopic anyday.|Fresh
Larraín's approach feels far too redundant. The director stacks the deck against Oscar just so he can watch the young man go from one kind of zealot to another, and provide his gluttonous hero with even more worship.|Rotten
Most of all, it is about the transforming power of art, how Neruda's own works fire the artistic sensibilities...|Fresh
It is marvelously acted and mostly entertaining, if you don't mind a film that frequently criss-crosses lanes between historical, satirical and a bit self-consciously self-important.|Fresh
The film plays with the myth, creates a darker version of the poet, in order to do...what?|Rotten
Quite a ponderous treatment of Chile's greatest poet.|Fresh
A great piece of cinema and a great attempt to engage with history and pro-people politics.|Fresh
What could be a simple, suspenseful hunt for impeached Senator Neruda becomes, in [director Pable] Larraín's artful film, a salute to Neruda's audacious defiance.|Fresh

A brisk biographical chase film about the communist Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, by the dazzling Chilean director Pablo Larraín.|Fresh
"""Neruda"" presents an interesting and imaginative way to consider the person - literary artist, ambassador, friend of Picasso and Nobel Prize winner - that Pablo Neruda (1904-1973) was."|Fresh
Visually, however, Neruda is a transfixing triumph, bending and erasing conventional cinema boundaries with dazzling ease.|Fresh
As the chase for Neruda intensifies, the characters transform and the trek becomes a philosophical and spiritual revolution|Fresh
As a study of freedom of speech and expression, it's still worth catching, as Neruda stood up and spoke up at a time when he could have been locked up, and we all need to do the same right NOW.|Fresh
This smart, whimsical, extremely quirky and devilishly entertaining portrait of the poet is far from being a traditional biography but it joyfully celebrates the spirit of the man and his momentous times.|Fresh
There's a comic edge to [Gael Garcia Bernal's] performance that steals the movie. In his bumbling, hapless way, he's a more sympathetic character than Neruda himself.|Fresh
Pablo Larrain's story of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is shot with a lush, rich colour palette and evokes a sense of humour that is usually missing in films of this ilk.|Fresh
Singularly winning mixture of irony, semi-parody and powerfully moving drama from the director of Jackie.|Fresh
Breathtaking cinematography, but focusing the narrative from Garcia'a character's point of view would have been far more compelling.|Rotten
It's almost there. But not quite. Not quite.|Fresh
Larraín doesn't water the content down for the audience; instead, he manages to keep it potent, and, what's further still, accessible.|Fresh
A magical quality takes hold as Larrain pushes his two excellent leads out into the beautiful ether.|Fresh
Pablo Larrain's ingenious, debonair biopic uses a blend of fact and fiction to celebrate the poet Pablo Neruda and the power of literature.|Fresh
"""Love is so short, forgetting is so long,"" Neruda once wrote. If only this Pablo were that succinct."|Rotten
It captivates for the scope of its invention, its ludic combination of reality and artifice, poetry and politics, as well as the contradictions of its central character.|Fresh
[An] indulgent and rather fey reverie.|Fresh
It's a clever, analytical film, as opposed to an absorbing one, which holds a funhouse mirror up to its subject in place of a looking-glass.|Fresh
The talented director Pablo Larraín, who brought us a slice of political myth with Jackie, is back on his Chilean home turf with Neruda, a wacky semi-biographical take on the radical poet and senator Pablo Neruda.|Fresh
Events are relayed with lashings of humour and romance, the sumptuous staging and showy camerawork fitting the flamboyant protagonist who's ill-suited to slumming it as a fugitive in the shadows.|Fresh
Larraín gives equal screen time to the detective on his trail (Gael García Bernal): a Clouseau-esque bumbler whose determination not to be a footnote lends tragi-comic heft.|Fresh
For all its ambition and scale, though, it feels like minor work.|Rotten
I felt a little distanced from it as I watched, and never felt able to connect with the characters the way it seemed to want m e to, but that said there are plenty of excellent scenes to enjoy along the way.|Fresh
Neruda starts as political cabaret, turns into dark fairytale, ends as a kind of destiny waltz.|Fresh
This is a determinedly playful, magical realist-style yarn.|Fresh
Tribute is paid to Pablo Neruda's memory by mixing an exquisite and irreverent cocktail of his passions: poetry, politics and pulp.|Fresh
Larraín gets a suspense ride around 'Neruda', but not as endearing and intimate as he proved in his 'Jackie'. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A risky mise-en-abyme narrative, more witty in the role than in reality. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Irreverent, funny and insightful, Neruda is unquestionably mannered but undeniably entertaining.|Fresh
An unusual and richly enjoyable love letter to a fellow artist and Chilean, Neruda further marks out Larraín as a director of serious range and ambition.|Fresh
CANNES 2016: Although it doesn't articulate as much of Pablo Neruda's heartbreakingly sublime poetry as the film could have, it provides valuable insight into a man whose gift for words was equal to his lust for life.|Fresh
Call it Larraín's Citizen Kane, the story of a man's life as understood through the stories surround him and the power that such stories and perceptions have.|Fresh
The story is equally divided between the two men, making for two distinct stories intertwined into one grander story.|Fresh
"Following his brilliantly unorthodox Jackie Kennedy film, director Pablo Larrain takes another unusual tack with his latest, (written by ""The Club's"" Guillermo Calderón) depicting one year in the life of Pablo Neruda (Luis Gnecco, ""No"")."|Fresh
Equal parts detective story, political thriller, chase movie, black comedy and head trip, Larraín's film is unequaled in its breadth and intellectual boldness.|Fresh
A Dionysian mischief to consummate the heretical portrait of poet Neruda as an obsessed and unfaithful obese goblin, unceasingly self-parodying and self-destructing whimsically by his own impulse. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Larrain weaves a thriller with lyric, a fantasy with literary and political echoes where sense of humor and the poetry are in function of the story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Pablo Larraín turns a biopic with this thriller as a game of cat and mouse, about Pablo Neruda. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A construction that oscillates between film noir and even western, Larraín obtains an entertaining and cerebral approach to Pablo Neruda. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It shows how poetry is capable of creating life even in a policeman and how the humble, anonymous human being needs the poet as much as he needs the people. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An almost surrealistic fiction that distances itself from the viewer, making difficult to get involved with the hunter or the prey. I recommend it due to its performances. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Larrain evokes the comfort of good fiction in every shot and every scene, even as his characters struggle to find the truth amid propaganda and lies.|Fresh
Neruda isn't filled with the writer's poetic words... But its focus on the man who made that poetry is strong, sharp and insightful.|Fresh
Larrain paints a fascinating and fantastic portrait of Neruda the artist as he wonders and worries about his role in society -- and his responsibilities to his family, his country and his readers.|Fresh
Larraín wraps his story of revolutionary poet Pablo Neruda within a fictional narrative; the approach is sadly unsuccessful.|Rotten
This is a strange and beguiling film to the end.|Fresh
Picaresque and playful account of Neruda's escape from Chile.|Fresh
Takes a skeptical view not only of its title character but of the idea of making anybody a hero.|Fresh
Pablo Larraín's film, before a biopic, is a movie that plays with the dispute of who is its protagonist, whether the poet or the detective who pursues him. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With humor and irreverence, Larraín draws his own Neruda in this provocative and baroque film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An interesting and complex, cold and pretentious film that generates admiration and rejection with the same force. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Desperately chasing the King of Love|Fresh
An engrossing blend of poet and filmmaker, of history and art, done up in florid period style.|Fresh
Luis Gnecco is perfect in the title role, charismatic but understated, capable of captivating others with his speech but not too good looking, so we never make the mistake of interpreting the feelings he inspires as simple lust.|Fresh
The essentials of transformation and urgency are well preserved by the production, which strives to turn Neruda's exile into wandering saga of obsession and self-preservation.|Fresh
t is a celebration of Neruda, but it's also a celebration of all that his work celebrates; an ode to the beauty of art and architecture and the natural world in honor of the master of odes.|Fresh
As a portrait of an artist with imperfections and genius, it has a truth that mere reportage cannot approach. As a portrait of a country grappling with applying abstract ideology to human endeavor, it is unimpeachable.|Fresh
Gnecco, García, and Morán's performances are succinct and beguiling, Larraín's touch is graceful.|Fresh
The mix of visual spoofs, mind games, and classical music is hugely entertaining, even if the realities of an emerging police state aren't ignored.|Fresh
Chilean director Pablo Larrain's biopic twists the formula around and explores surprisingly intimate and universal themes, while still guiding expert performances.|Fresh
The actors make the robust, confident Neruda and the thin, self-doubting Peluchonneau riveting psychological, as well as physical, complements.|Fresh
Neruda is ultimately about as historically accurate as Miles Ahead, but like that film, it's also more satisfying and poetically truthful than had it just related events as they happened.|Fresh
The feature's pleasures and resonance only increase as the real and the illusory intertwine.|Fresh
Larrain's film is still worth watching for its highs and despite the odd misstep, it's a fine film that flirts with being something greater.|Fresh
Peluchonneau may not always know what he's doing and Neruda himself may also lean similarly towards self delusion but Larraín himself is always in control of this strangely funny but ultimately moving historical drama.|Fresh
As the voices of the two men blend together ... we realize that their stories are what matter to people, regardless of whether those tales are genuine or fictional.|Fresh
As in all his movies, Larrain is an expert juggler of tones: by turns antic and lyrical, Neruda is shot with a dark, nocturnal beauty and a mournful orchestral score.|Fresh
[An] intriguingly idiosyncratic experience.|Fresh
It reminds us that movies, by their very nature, owe far more to poetry than they ever will to the novel.|Fresh
Larraín's play with time and performance is largely hypnotic, down to an exemplary ending within mythic landscape.|Fresh
A clever, playful and, yes, poetic accounting of the literary icon's run for his life from his home country of Chile.|Fresh
The past is hardly past: Neruda is a vintage ﬁgure, but his story is made fresh by both the ﬁlmmakers' imaginative will and by the oppression-stalked century we ﬁnd ourselves in.|Fresh
Each [of Larraín's films] has a plan, each film has a backbone, but their airy and ethereal qualities suggest a penchant for riffing, as though he's filling in the gaps between truth and myth sequence by sequence.|Fresh
Neruda certainly has its felicities, but throughout Larraín proves all too eager to point out the sheer artifice of his endeavor.|Rotten
A virtual fireworks show about the power of poetry and fame on the world.|Fresh
Even if you've only heard of Neruda's sonnets or his Stalinist leanings, you don't need much in the way of introduction to enjoy this meta-narrative.|Fresh
The real trouble is that Neruda is never regarded as anything but a figure of mythic status by his allies.|Rotten
Bathed in expressive natural light and bestowed with a sense of constant movement, the movie also pulls even further back from the specifics of Neruda's story to depict a battle for the essence of a nation at war with itself.|Fresh
The crafting of identity is at the heart of this highly literary and philosophical noir.|Fresh
Neruda offers a captivating and unusual approach to a famous person's life. I know little about the poet but I fell under this movie's sway|Fresh
Neruda is, like all the Larraín films I've seen, laudable in its ambitions and ultimately unsatisfying in its execution.|Rotten
Evocative and dramatically compelling, the film drifts between fantasy and reality in a way that Neruda himself would appreciate.|Fresh
Is Neruda a cinematic play, a poem, a biopic? In this near-perfect homage to a literary giant, it's all open to interpretation.|Fresh
For anyone who believes that poetry and democracy spring from the same source and provoke the same enemies, this movie provides both encouragement and warning.|Fresh
"""Neruda"" is a brilliant study of a man's passion for life and poetry. Gnecco brings this eccentric, beloved poet to life with wit and panache."|Fresh
It's funny and emotional, and visually stunning as it criss-crosses Chile from the ocean to the ice-capped Andean peaks. And its originality makes it simply stunning.|Fresh
With great supporting performances and an intelligent script, it's an accomplished and engrossing tale.|Fresh
Chilean director Pablo Larraín seems to be on a one-man mission to revolutionize the biopic genre.|Fresh
A fascinating -- though overlong and sometimes slow -- trackdown fantasy with literary and political resonance.|Fresh
"""Neruda"" is meta-sorta-fiction, always calling attention to its own artificiality. But its sincere about wanting to do the impossible: understand, perhaps even forgive, someone who stands for everything you stand against."|Fresh
Drolly and persuasively, the movie demonstrates that when it comes to evoking the artist and the nature of his art, historical fidelity and literal-minded dramatization go only so far.|Fresh
The more Neruda departs from historical fact, the more trenchant it becomes. Take note, other filmmakers.|Fresh
Neruda is a work of inspired mischief, in which the art of storytelling is inextricable from historical fact.|Fresh
The poetic narration, while lyrical, has a distancing effect, but that's not necessarily a negative in this context: What results is a highly artistic, atmospheric and deftly-written cat-and-mouse game.|Fresh
[A] handsome, thoughtful and wisecracking metafictional lark.|Fresh
A Chilean film that blends fantasy and realism in its treatment of poet Pablo Neruda and a policeman fascinated with him.|Fresh
Larraín, born in Santiago in 1976, takes an oblique approach to his subject, one of his country's most exalted heroes - a strategy that renders the past always labile and dynamic, never static and turgid.|Fresh
Amply clever and easy on the eyes, though it uses all that cleverness and craft more to deflect than to illuminate.|Fresh
Not many directors get a one-two punch like Jackie and Neruda in the same season, but it just makes it all the more clear that Larrain is one of the world's most exciting and imaginative filmmakers, whatever the subject may be.|Fresh
This is a wildly romantic biographical drama about the great poet widely known by his pen name, Pablo Neruda. Years before his downfall, we see Neruda the artist, Neruda the romantic, Neruda the trickster, foiling the dark powers with wit and courage.|Fresh
Humanizes the great poet who appealed to intellectuals, peasants, workers and prostitutes.|Fresh
Larrain has rapidly grown into the smartest political filmmaker working today. The great thing is, though, that he keeps proving himself a filmmaker first.|Fresh
I don't know if Roberto Bolaño himself could have teased out so well the desire of a hate-filled, impoverished flunky merely to be recognized by the famous artist he's out to destroy.|Fresh
An interesting film that seeks to provoke in the viewer the experience of recreating Neruda's universe. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With an artistic and cinematographic quality, this film has a big heart. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Neruda culminates in a series of scenes in the snow that are riveting in terms of what they say about art, history, politics and human nature.|Fresh
A film that plays with the boundaries between reality and fiction, not only in the life of the writer but in regard to the narrative construction itself. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Pablo Larraín has captured Pablo Neruda in all of his pomposity, pretense, courage, and undeniable genius.|Fresh
A film that navigates through genre with historical facts, where the director turns Neruda into something like a character from a detective story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A political film about a poet. And a poetic film about a politician. Something far from being a conventional biopic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An exuberant visual poem reflecting the life and politics of the Chilean poet, Neruda is much more than a simple biopic.|Fresh
While it evokes Borges more than Neruda, the film works because gives a conceptual twist to what could have been a conventional biopic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The director captures a great, brilliant and a very real Neruda. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Moody, unsentimental, gorgeous to look at and a little meta: I loved it.|Fresh
It's clever and stylish, and while not entirely successful, Larraín handles his ambitious material well.|Fresh
A fascinating examination of the role of radical artist in bourgeois society that prioritizes the drama of an individual rather than the social drama of a crackdown that anticipated Pinochet. Despite that, it is great filmmaking.|Fresh
Neruda's anti-biopic structure allows the poet to play in the noir and Western genres that a writer of odes might have always wished to have done, but didn't.|Fresh
A playfully unexpected spin on a historical drama.|Fresh
Neruda feels like such a leap into the unknown that it's almost outside the solar system - it's the Pluto of Larraín's filmography so far.|Fresh
The artist is intelligently humanized on this wonderful biopic of one of the most interesting chapters in the life of an amazing man. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film breaks the biopic conventions and manages to become a lyrical and fictionalize version of that inside a splendid montage. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of the most suggestive and interesting visual narratives in Cannes 2016. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As radical a reinvention of the biopic as Todd Haynes' I'm Not There, Neruda is Larraín's most conceptual and also his most demanding film yet.|Fresh
Anyone expecting a straightforward biographical account will be in for a surprise.|Fresh
A complex and fascinating character study.|Fresh
"Pablo Larrain knocks it out of the park with his ""anti-biopic"" about the Chilean poet. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
"Not a biopic but a Nerudian take on the famed Chilean politician-poet, ""Neruda"" is a stunningly inventive take on the function rather than the life of a writer."|Fresh
It is often very funny, unsettling and yet still proves illuminating on the character of Neruda and the battle for Chile in the 1940s.|Fresh
The film at times is more playful than illuminating, but it's also a handsomely crafted and boldly idiosyncratic contemplation of a great artist for whom political compromise was anathema.|Fresh
