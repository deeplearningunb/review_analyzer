It's a grown-up, patient look at infertility that, even enchanting here and there, misses that little spark that leads to the heart.|Rotten
This is a very well acted movie. It is a good, solid story with well-drawn characters. It isn't a great story, but I was on board, through the unevenness of it, up until the end.|Fresh
An immaculate gem of modest filmmaking and plotting hiding exemplary human-scale writing and performance.|Fresh
Private Life is essentially a warmly melancholic, empathic film that holds your hand when it's most needed.|Fresh
The story is far from universal, and the characters will fail to elicit much sympathy from those who haven't experienced similar issues, but this is a well written film that's worth watching.|Fresh
Director Tamara Jenkins has always been one of the finest chroniclers of the American upper middle class, and this may be her most anxiety-inducing effort yet.|Fresh
Director and Oscar-nominated screenwriter Tamara Jenkins has crafted a genuinely touching and humorous human narrative about a husband and wife desperate for a family. Paul Giamatti and Kathryn Hahn have never been better.|Fresh
The way Jenkins pulls down the curtains or rather pulls up the scroll of what's clearly a deeply personal work is just beautiful.|Fresh
It's unconscionable that the various movie awards' voting bodies have thus far failed to properly recognize Kathryn Hahn's masterful turn in this.|Fresh

We know these characters on an intimate level so the tough scenes can exist with contextual introspection and not knee-jerk vitriol.|Fresh
Private Life tackles worthy feminist issues about raising a family and sacrificing your career, but it is also too overlong and meandering to have any true resonance.|Rotten
It understands that the struggle for fertility can make monsters of anyone, and it doesn't judge its characters. It doesn't let them off the hook either, and it avoids offering easy outs. In other words, it feels about as real as movies get.|Fresh
Despite its flaws it's a masterfully acted and a smart indie adult film, a mature comedy that rarely gets made anymore by the business-minded big studios.|Fresh
Private Life cycles through opposing emotions and forces, waiting for a break in the circle so that new life can dawn. It also understands that such a dawning may never come, and that we are never alone in such tragedies.|Fresh
Kayli Carter bridges the ache and absurdity and becomes the movie's salvation, just as her character, Sadie, tries to be.|Fresh
The film... is really elegant in its staging, provides a breath of intelligent lightness within a tumultuous and overwhelming theme, a generous and sincere film about the complexity of the desire to have a baby. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Beautifully scripted and acted under the sublime direction of Tamara Jenkins.|Fresh
A dramady carried by many magic moments of heartache and humor.|Fresh
Mature dramedy about infertility has lots of sex, cursing.|Fresh
Giamatti's face is a thing of pure comic beauty: staring off into the middle distance, frozen by the conflicting demands of etiquette and his stifled inner howl. He makes humiliation sing.|Fresh
It's a pleasure to see [Kathryn] Hahn, and especially the young [Kayli] Carter, who plays the most complex role in this melodrama that can't leave anyone indifferent. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Everything works about this film except for a dubious ending that makes the couple look less sympathetic. A crowd-pleaser.|Fresh
Private Life is an intimate drama we've seen before, but it leads to so many provocative questions about the individual versus the family.|Fresh
"In the end, no, it probably doesn't matter that anybody with a Netflix password can watch the A-grade ""Private Life"" instead of having to schlep to the theater."|Fresh
In the midst of a cleverly executed tale, is a career-best turn from the brilliant Kathryn Hahn.|Fresh
It's good to have Jenkins back, and it's helpful that when she makes a film, it's always keenly observed and emotionally precise.|Fresh
Seldom an all-out comedy, though it does have droll moments and scenes... Hahn, a comedy dynamo, gives a deeply felt dramatic performance.|Fresh
Anyone expecting a broad, witty comedy about a couple navigating sticky waters will immediately be floored and taken aback by what Jenkins and her cast have been able to accomplish with Private Life.|Fresh
Tamara Jenkins needs to make more movies. Every time she does, something special happens.|Fresh
In its commitment to documenting the specificities of its characters' lives and their ongoing struggles, the film takes on a sprawling quality. If you follow the movements and digressions over a long period of time, you'll be rewarded.|Fresh
Fine actors Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti draw us into their characters' world of infertility suffering and hold us hostage throughout the film's entire running time.|Fresh
Biting humour, big love and an understanding, compassionate view of human nature = touching.|Fresh
There are a few ways that this story could proceed. To Jenkins' credit, she takes the most straightforward approach...|Fresh
Anytime we hear positive news regarding a new procedure, Rachel's (Kathryn Hahn) joy is palpable, and we are just as ready to cry right there with her whenever an unfortunate turn of events rains on the parade|Fresh
[Director Tamara] Jenkins's talent for everyday doses of acid and irony is here.|Fresh
Private Life mostly avoids doling out clunky exposition, but one gets the sense that Jenkins could answer even the most minute questions about her characters' backstories.|Fresh
Hahn is one of the best actresses working today, and it's a thrill to see her at the center of a film, jagged with heartbreak, rage, hormones. This is a role worthy of her tremendous gifts.|Fresh
It is, at its best, so warmly, recognizably human, with some great performances. It's adult indie drama done at its highest level.|Fresh
An overdue and welcome directorial comeback.|Fresh
This film is a reminder that the smallness of life can feel huge when we're in the middle of it.|Fresh
Private Life will stand as one of the high points of Giamatti and Hahn's respective careers.|Fresh
What an intelligent, emotionally grown-up film. More of this please.|Fresh
The struggle to conceive isn't a new subject, but this comedy drama highlights its fraughtness and absurdity via a perceptive, often hilarious script and two hugely likeable leads in Paul Giamatti and Kathryn Hahn.|Fresh
In Richard [director Tamara] Jenkins has created a role that fits Mr. Giamatti, who has always been great at comic gloom, like a glove that should have been one size larger.|Fresh
Paul Giamatti and Kathryn Hahn are funny and heartbreaking in Netflix's best movie yet.|Fresh
Jenkins has made a film about marriage and family and personhood, catching Rachel and Richard at a time in their lives where something is missing, and a child just seems like that crucial piece of the puzzle.|Fresh
You don't have to have had any experience with the difficulties of getting pregnant to enjoy a comedy that is saved from charges of urbane preciousnesses by Giamatti and Hahn.|Fresh
Jenkins manages to find a bleak sort of humor in all of this, but the heartache of the situation is achingly close to the surface.|Fresh
Even as Jenkins brings out the angst, her inner comic strategist remains hard at work, building sly jokes into the edge of the frame; she has a talent for rendering comedy and tragedy virtually indistinguishable.|Fresh
"""Private Life"" earns its laughs, to be sure. But more important, it earns the tears of recognition that fall, gently and warmly, between the yuks."|Fresh
It's about love, and pain, and marriage, and friendship, and family. And it's also about enduring, about picking yourself up over and over and over, in the eternal hope that something beautiful is waiting around the corner.|Fresh
"""Private Life"" shows considerable skill on the part of Jenkins, who creates the illusion that we're only incidentally watching a movie, that we're really just hanging out with some nice people and seeing how their lives work out."|Fresh
In its busy closing stretch, there is a fine group portrait of characters coming to terms with the difference between what they might never be and what they can be for each other.|Fresh
Someone once said that life is what happens while you're making other plans. This movie is about the plans that happen while you're trying to make another life.|Fresh
Jenkins allows both of her leads actually to be leads: They share the film and most scenes, and much of its vital power arises from the connection between them.|Fresh
Jenkins has a delicate, wry touch with the dialogue, and her cast volleys it back and forth beautifully.|Fresh
The balanced and grounded characters that populate Private Life draw us into their lives and their struggles, thanks to the keen eye of a talented filmmaker like Tamara Jenkins.|Fresh
It's about perseverance, compassion, and empathy.|Fresh
Private Life is a deeply personal - perhaps even invasive - look at the challenges facing one privileged, artsy New York couple...played perfectly by Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti.|Fresh
The searing mix of comedy and drama provides showcase roles for two gifted prime-time veterans.|Fresh
Frustration is not an emotion I seek out when I go to the movies. For all of the heartache going on in Private Life, as a narrative journey it winds up traveling approximately a quarter of an inch.|Rotten
Instead of offering a probing, nuanced view of the burgeoning technologies and sciences involved in this relatively new outgrowth of the OBGYN industry, though, Tamara Jenkins uses her setting as fodder for lame and discomfiting physical comedy.|Rotten
Private Life miraculously gifts the viewer an empathetic lens to a painful battle, usually whispered, rarely openly discussed.|Fresh
Private Life refuses to stick to just one mode of storytelling - it has slapstick and melodrama, heartbreak and hope.|Fresh
A generous, graceful, full-hearted drama about the complexities of desiring a child when your physiology denies you at every turn.|Fresh
It's this colorful ensemble that keeps the film engaging.|Fresh
While the ups and downs of the fertilization procedures is repetitive, the fully-formed characters portrayed by Giamatti and Hahn are the kind we don't get in very many mainstream movies.|Fresh
The specificity of both the circumstances and these characters' relationships fights off cliché or self-pity.|Fresh
Tamara Jenkins serves up hilariously uncomfortable moments like this throughout Private Life, and she never once pays them off in a conventionally satisfying manner.|Fresh
Jenkins' writing underlines the fundamental instability at the heart of all our lives, while proposing that most universal of remedies: empathy, love.|Fresh
Plainly, painfully personal.|Fresh
Hahn and Giamatti lead an amazing ensemble cast in a movie that's both hilarious and hard to endure. Private Life is honest, for better and worse.|Fresh
This is a story you'll want to watch to its exquisitely compassionate ending: a wordless final-credits aria that, as with Michael Clayton and Call Me by Your Name, speaks volumes about the nature of minute-to-minute emotional survival.|Fresh
Jenkins has a vision and something interesting to say in Private Life, but it needs some serious editing to convey it succinctly.|Rotten
This is a good one that marks a strong comeback for [director Tamara] Jenkins, and gives Hahn a breakout part playing someone more down-to-earth than she's usually allowed to.|Fresh
The geometry of this strange triangle is always in flux, but it's always raw and engaging to watch the Grimes weigh the life they want to create against the ones they're in the process of living.|Fresh
The film does an exceptional job mixing its humor with melancholy. Serious moments are interrupted by laugh out loud jokes and gags, while levity and warm sentiment are crushed by failure and disappointment. At its core, this is a story about persistence.|Fresh
There are elements on the fringe of Private Life (a few supporting performances, the 127-minute length, a couple of sitcomish turns), that keep it from connecting as much I wanted, but the work by Paul Giamatti and Kathryn Hahn always holds it together.|Fresh
They're such interesting people, and the person telling their story cares enough to make them real.|Fresh
"Most of this stuff is sharply, at times squeamishly, funny, though the laughter also catches in our throats, since ""Private Life"" is built around a core of heartbreak."|Fresh
