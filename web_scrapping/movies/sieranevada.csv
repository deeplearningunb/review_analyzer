With little hierarchal order to the proceedings--but with distinct delineations between national, political, and theological dispositions--the film manages to hold everyone accountable.|Fresh
It keeps the spectator in a state of multiple alertness, irritates, undermines, overwhelms, fascinates and delusions directly and indirectly thanks to its impeccable edition. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A lucid and acid diagnosis of a society that has made hostility its daily life (according to what we can infer because of its cinema). [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sieranevada demands a lot of the spectator, but the film gives back moments full of lucidity and powerful and transcendent cinematic narration. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The story goes on without being exhausted, showing the relationships of a dysfunctional family with absurd moments in which the emotions are expressed with strange intimacy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An exercise in cinema so precise, ambitious and, if you will, torn. And tragically comic. Maybe monumental. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An electrifying family reunion that becomes evil and bilious dance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A work that faces the viewer with the most stimulating and stark specificity of cinema as a language. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I have already read that this extraordinary film marks a before and after in the language film. I am convinced of this, it's impossible to make it worse. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The dominant tone of the film is a dark comedy plagued by absurd situations and rituals, sometimes in the manner of an Italian comedy of the 1960s. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten

This dramatic comedy that takes place in an apartment is another example of the good moment Romanian cinema is going through. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The hyper-realistic performances and strong screenplay make the punishing runtime, designed to make you feel the exhaustion of family gatherings, worth pushing through.|Fresh
That's the other thing about Puiu's brand of realism: it effaces the virtuosity required to pull it off. The very mode downplays the feat.|Fresh
Sieranevada pulses with humour, insight and momentum and is one of the most beautifully wrought films of the past year.|Fresh
The thematic argument does not become inaccurate simply by virtue of being familiar.|Fresh
Plenty of mordant humor.|Fresh
A film that tries to combine audiovisual and space-time manipulation with a background that pretends to be realistic by means of a technique that impresses but which, above all, seeks naturalness and efficiency. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film in which Cristi Puiu stretches the footage of his plot in order to establish a closeness between the viewer and the characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"What's exciting in Sieranevada -- or, again, depending on your aesthetic preference, ""taxing"" -- is how the raucous, multi-directional dramaturgy keeps us from apprehending the true shape of the film for most of its duration."|Fresh
The barely muffled anger and violence of the social ills at Sieranevada's core hint at but never reveal the larger political chaos seemingly waiting to erupt just off camera.|Rotten
... the film never gets beyond the banal, never digs deep enough to evoke something that is beyond what we can see on screen.|Rotten
Always introducing new characters, the director creates a wonderful analogy about the decadence and irrelevace of one's destiny using irresistible humor to do it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Puiu scoops up storylines and arguments and revelations armful by messy armful and ... Sieranevada becomes by turns pit-of-stomach-sad, flight-of-fancy funny and pin-in-heart moving.|Fresh
Romanian writer-director Cristi Puiu makes films that are, in the best sense, endurance tests.|Fresh
Another magnificent work of the yet inexhaustible Romanian cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It explores family relationships, infidelities, and internal treasons, but it never leaves political context outside. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A movie that might be a little too long (173 minutes) but full of metaphors and themes to explore, a film that allows itself to be read in many ways. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sieranevada exposes unrelentlessly and with great and sharp humor a society where faith and ideologies from the past have now been erradicated. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The camera follows the character in long sequences with a virtuosity that is absolutely uncanny. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Those engaged with the numerous characters, their fights, their humor, will be able to enjoy this peculiar naturalism of Rumanian cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"A wickedly funny, infinitely compassionate and profound work about the elusiveness of truth and what one character calls a world ""contaminated by fear."""|Fresh
The good news is that it's still a top-drawer New Wave film, familiar in the best ways while offering fascinating insights into human nature, identity and foibles.|Fresh
Following The Death of Mr Lazarescu, Puiu's latest film benefits from a fine ensemble cast and an evocative depiction of a family, and a country, dealing with the sudden wake of tragedy.|Fresh
A claustrophobic, quietly absurd family portrait.|Fresh
It's a highly persuasive portrait of family life, replete with intimacies, special alliances, tensions, resentments and reconciliations, but also a revealing study of how that may reflect developments in the wider world.|Fresh
Those familiar with Puiu's work might not be thrown by his patient approach, but the ponderous technique takes no prisoners for the uninitiated.|Fresh
It earns respect and a cumulative awe in its intently amused vision of reality: it's a commanding and intellectually gratifying piece of work.|Fresh
Puiu's exceptional script foments a burning wish to figure out all the character configurations, conflicts and backstories, ensuring that Sieranevada remains consistently, intensely engaging.|Fresh
Offers not only a masterful portrait of the contemporary Romanian middle-class but also a whole set of smart, perceptive reflections on the relativity of truth, on the failings of memory, the interpretation of history, the significance of religion ...|Fresh
The proceedings are claustrophobic, intense and alienated - often brilliant, sometimes slightly redundant.|Fresh
