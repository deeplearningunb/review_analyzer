Bumblebee is an incredibly nice breath of fresh air compared to the previous Transformers movies. If you have been scarred or turned off by the Michael Bay version of the franchise, then this movie is certainly a welcomed change of pace.|Fresh

Lack of racial diversity in Bumblebee is tempered by a complex female lead, with the end result of a rockin' movie guaranteed to make your Millennial soul soar.|Fresh
A rarity for a Transformers outing: actual characters with definable arcs! What a concept!|Fresh
The 80's setting adds to the fun, lighthearted atmosphere of the film that was so confusingly absent from the Bay Transformer movies.|Fresh
"At last: a ""Transformers"" movie with the humor and heart of the source material."|Fresh
"""A simple, joyful, popcorn movie""."|Fresh
Bumblebee is a nostalgic bundle of fun, poignant and nostalgic joy with all the 80's tropes that one could want. Not only is it a good Transformers movie, it is a good movie that stand on its own bee's knees.|Fresh
All of the Transformers films before this one have been steaming piles of poo. So the fact that this one is watchable means, by default, that it's the best Transformers film ever.|Fresh
...a mildly watchable, geared-towards-small-children diversion that could (and should) have been better.|Rotten
A significant course correction for the series but only a modest success.|Fresh
A blockbuster about robots that feels anything but robotic, and not really like a blockbuster. The central relationship is as solid as B:127; I did cry, and not because they only played one Duran Duran song. (It was the best Duran Duran song.)|Fresh
... works best when the story sticks to the buddy-film trappings... makes you wish this is where they had actually started instead.|Fresh
Compared to the previous 'Transformers' movies, Bumblebee is a breath of fresh air, emotional and surprisingly honest. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bumblebee is a prequel we didn't really want, but man, I'm glad we got it.|Fresh
Bumblebee gets its best moments when it sticks with the characters and their conflicts. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bumblebee is pretty good folks, making it one of 2018's biggest surprises of the year.|Fresh
Hailee Steinfeld is a natural in front of the camera and brings out all the nuances required for the role like a pro.|Fresh
The sixth instalment in the Transformers movie series is the best yet, but that is not saying very much because of the low bar set by the other five.|Rotten
For a series that was on the verge of being dismantled and sold for scraps, much like Bumblebee, it has found a saviour. Travis Knight has lived up to his name. The Transformers can wear his shiny armour.|Fresh
In what feels like a reboot Knight takes the character of Bumblebee and crafts an immensely satisfying, heartfelt film that the entire family will enjoy.|Fresh
Bumblebee does set the Transformers franchise on a promising new path, one that inevitable future instalments - multiple prequels and spin-offs are in development - could do well to learn from.|Fresh
To the surprise of no one, the removal of Michael Bay from the creative driver's seat of the franchise results in a sharp rise in visual coherence and a sharp dip in toxic masculinity.|Fresh
The first three minutes of Bumblebee are already better than all the Transformers films directed by Michael Bay. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I appreciated the scale back so now we could see the action and take it in but it was it was still kind of soft.|Fresh
Bumblebee is certainly the best example of what this franchise is meant to be.|Fresh
Bumblebee is the sort of Transformers movie I want to watch. It surprised me in a decidedly non-automated way.|Fresh
The screenplay is genuinely clever and funny, but those battle scenes are interminable.|Fresh
A film with a playful and noble essence, Bumblebee manages to mix Transformers with the nostalgia of the 80s and it's better than it sounds. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A bittersweet origin story becomes sci-fi with heart!|Fresh
All the Transformers movies have had some humor in the mix, while also trying to be serious. This movie works the comic/serious motif about as well as can be expected, given the subject matter.|Fresh
Families can enjoy a sweet, simple, charming, and heartfelt story, about a young girl trying not to be quite so angry anymore, with the help of her giant robot friend. A tale as old as time.|Fresh
We now have a Transformers film that remembers to have fun and, most importantly, realises that even a little heart goes a long way.|Fresh
I suppose after a steady diet of moldy-green, one-month-old bread, even a bite of slightly stale, one-week-old bread would taste delicious.|Rotten
Though the references are familiar, it's a fresh direction for the macho franchise.|Fresh
It's the charming relationship between Hailee Steinfeld's 18 year old protagonist, Charlie and the alien robot she names Bumblebee, that makes this Transformers prequel into a heartwarming fantasy.|Fresh
There is still ruckus, but with light sifting.|Fresh
Fortunately, Bumblebee is the way to rejuvenate this series of films and does it in such a friendly and good way that you definitely will not want to miss it. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
With Bumblebee, the filmmaker Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) presents the best Transformers film, as well as a light and entertaining film adventure. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Bumblebee"" is tender and refreshing and a notable exercise in the use of old-fashioned narration. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
It's not a patch on that classic: its plot is as mechanical as its hero and the Transformers are fundamentally dull creations. But it's a cheerful, well-paced film with coherent action sequences.|Fresh
Definitely the most watchable Transformers outing by a mile, then, but that is not saying a whole lot.|Fresh
Manages not only the relatively insignificant feat of being the best Transformers movie, but more impressively, of being a Transformers film that's actually fun to watch.|Fresh
The film resembles this playful yellow robot's dysfunctional radio.... Sometimes, it tunes in genuine freshness. But the rest... becomes an uncomfortable journey among forced eighties nostalgia. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bumblebee rises from what was left behind of the previous films and gives us a story with heart. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Director Travis Knight] brings spirit to a (new?) saga to which the former has much to envy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"It's a very much ""less is more"" mentality. Simpler designs, bold colors, and you know which Transformer is which... [I] came out of it happy."|Fresh
To see the series finally reflected on the big screen with the same childlike wonder of playing with the toys in your bedroom is cathartic after years of Bay's cinematic mayhem.|Fresh
[Bumblebee] felt like a classic 1980s feel-good movie that happened to have Transformers in it.|Fresh
At times very funny, Bumblebee is still at heart a big ol' B-movie, but less bumbling and bombastic than its post-dated predecessors.|Fresh
Bumblebee runs less than two hours and actually has a story, so that automatically makes it the best Transformers movie since the original.|Fresh
Travis Knight accomplishes a far superior production than the previous Michael Bay films. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
There are big splashy battles, sure, and a little bit of political intrigue in the plotting. But this movie was unabashedly designed to be a kick in the feelings. Again: strange for a Transformers movie. Not in a bad way, necessarily.|Fresh
A frustrating joy ride. It'd be twice as good if it was half as long.|Rotten
Paramount actually made a Transformers movie that's a lovely, exciting and wholly engaging gem of a sci-fi adventure for teenagers.|Fresh
Never thought I would speak the words 'I was charmed by a Transformers movie,' but here we are.|Fresh
As he proved in his brilliant directorial debut Kubo and the Two Strings, Knight has an ability to capture the way young people process grief in an engaging way.|Fresh
It's the first since the original 1984 animated film to do what a Transformers movie is supposed to do - entertain kids of all ages, and grown-ups too.|Fresh
This movie has more genuine heart and humor in its first 20 minutes than the rest of the [Transformers] series has in its collective 12.5-hour runtime.|Fresh
Best live-action Transformers movie so far. 'Nuff said. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
If the other Transformers movies had been like this, they, too, might have been enjoyable fantasy adventures.|Fresh
The special effects surrounding these robots' radical changes isn't as wow-inducing as it was 11 years ago, but at least Bumblebee tries to tell a story while it employs them.|Rotten
A family-friendly, energetic surprise that injects fresh new life into the abysmal franchise.|Fresh
Bumblebee works best when the story is focused on Charlie. For a Transformers movie, it's surprisingly serviceable.|Fresh
Undoubtedly energetic, infectiously witty, and resourcefully feisty...frenzied family fun entertainment with a notable message about belonging and feeling connected. The film's pounce-and-pathos mantra is refreshingly poignant and invigorating|Fresh
Though free of the hyper-kinetic shooting style of Transformers maestro Michael Bay, the film is spiced by similarly fluid direction by Travis Knight who maintains the high visual standard of the franchise while clearly aiming at a younger demographic.|Fresh
This is the first of the Transformers movies that I've actually enjoyed.|Fresh
Basically just good enough to let us forgive all of the Transformers films since the '86 original. Hailee Steinfeld carries it as the best human lead in the films yet.|Fresh
Knight deserves particular credit for weaving together so skilfully what are, in effect, two quite different staples of movie story-telling - the chippy teen who is out of step with the world, and the fighting alien robots.|Fresh
Puerile as it is, it is entertaining to watch these autobots and decepticons transform themselves into their alter personas (you should pardon the expression), like cars and airplanes. Call me crazy; I liked it.|Fresh
With its close focus on Charlie and on her hardworking mother (Pamela Adlon), it makes a cogent and timely argument for enlivening tired male properties with a female-focused narrative.|Fresh
Beautifully directed by Travis Knight..with a light, almost Spielbergian touch, Bumblebee is a delight from start to finish.|Fresh
I can say without hesitation that this is the best entry in the series so far. And not only that, it's a pretty good film on its own. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Yes, Bumblebee has a more human feel than its five previous predecessors, but itÂ's still aligned with its five predecessors, and let's be honest: In Bumblebee smashing things becomes an inevitable accompaniment to mending hearts.|Fresh
Set in 1987, this breezy, bright, summery movie is steeped in 1980s culture, feeling a lot like E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Short Circuit, and other movie adventures of the day.|Fresh
Steinfeld gives the film its heart.|Fresh
Such a confidently put together, fully-realized, genuinely fun little film that it'd still be the best Transformers movie and one of 2018's nicest surprises even without [the] low-key gratuitous fan service.|Fresh
The most emotionally resonant and fulfilling Transformers since the feature series first rolled out in 2007.|Fresh
Knight is able to milk the softness of Bumblebee's eyes, which are like two big, blue flashlights, and he gives the robot giant - and the story - a beating heart.|Fresh
There's way more than meets the eye going on here, and I for one I'm blissfully happy about that.|Fresh
Hodson and Knight therefore go beyond just creating the franchise's best chapter. They expose how toxic the others are.|Fresh
This story about a young woman and her self-aware Volkswagen is warm, funny, relatable, coherent and less than two hours long - all first-time traits in the Transformers universe.|Fresh
113 minutes (and feels longer) of a lukewarm, John Hughes-ified clone of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.|Rotten
Against all odds, Bumblebee is a promising new beginning for the Transformers franchise. If they can continue with this more character driven approach and remove it completely from Bay's continuity, they definitely could have something here.|Fresh
"It's actually too bad ""Bumblebee"" is meant to be a prequel to the other movies. It would be great if they just used this one to reboot the whole series and start over from here."|Fresh
It's the simplicity, grounded in a character-driven story, that makes the film feel like those classic 80s movies where anything could happen to a bunch of kids with minimal parental supervision.|Fresh
A necessary course correction but it requires Knight and his crew to spend so much time focused on what the series is not, it never comes up with a good case what it is.|Fresh
Maybe the film's biggest misstep is trying to fit into the horrible Bay continuity instead of taking the time for a complete reboot. This film deserves far better than being forced into the Bayformers franchise.|Fresh
[With Bumblebee] Travis Knight...finds the honey suckle sweet spot in a John Hughes/Steven Spielberg-inspired coming-of-age blockbuster.|Fresh
If the series is not completely transformed, it does remind us why we liked the Transformers to begin with, and that's a good start.|Fresh
So compelling. It was really, really well acted. Kudos to Hailee Steinfeld.|Fresh
Man, was this worth it. A very, very good movie.|Fresh
While there are elements here that work, including Steinfeld's impressive performance as a formidably sullen teen, it's still, at heart, just another damn Transformers movie...|Rotten
I could launch a whole shared universe out of this.|Fresh
This is a movie to watch for Steinfeld. The classic Transformers feel and look is here.|Fresh
We're abuzz about the franchise having transformed into a leaner, character-driven and altogether delightful one...|Fresh
It's the best Transformers film thus far, but that is damning with so much faint praise as to be a verbal shrug.|Fresh
Written by Christina Hodgson, [Bumblebee] possesses something only the original could claim: heart, and it's unabashed about it.|Fresh
Mankind has split the atom, sent a man to the moon, and now, in arguably its most unlikely achievement, it has produced a watchable Transformers movie.|Fresh
[T]he film has a heart, which is something that has been sorely missing from all of its predecessors.|Fresh
Bumblebee is proof that it is possible to become emotionally invested in a movie where giants robots punch each other in the face.|Fresh
Bumblebee isn't just a good movie compared to other Transformers movies. It's a good movie, period.|Fresh
Shows that the franchise about alien robots that turn into cars still has some gas left in the tank.|Fresh
Shock of all shocks this is a Transformers movie that is actually quite terrific . Hailee Steinfeld and a lovable piece of metal are a big part of the reason.|Fresh
This is the first film inspired by the Hasbro toys in a decade that can't be discarded as junk. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Plenty of loud-and-dumb still exists, but at least the pompous hubris and sophomoric fixations that fuel it are exchanged for those three missing elements of tone, character, and heart.|Fresh
"Add one more ""first"" to the list for ""BumbleBee"": It's the first ""Transformers"" movie that lives up to the franchise's mantra, that it's ""more than meets the eye."""|Fresh
It isn't a flawless movie, and it nearly descends into self-parody at times, but after a decade of Bay's rock-'em sock-'em battles, Bumblebee nevertheless comes across like a mini-revelation: Transformers movies don't need to be terrible.|Fresh
"Nothing about it ever threatens to edge into ""great"" territory, but it's winsome, earnest and good-hearted, and that's more than enough to make it easily the best movie in the series."|Fresh
Even grading on a curve, though, this is a solidly executed story, tapping the familiar theme of a troubled kid whose life is changed by an extraordinary visitor.|Fresh
[Charlie] turns out to be one of the strongest and most credible protagonists of the saga. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director Knight keeps the film lively, funny, and - perhaps most importantly - easy to follow.|Fresh
Knight keeps things under control thanks to his keen sense of pacing and use of Bumblebee as a sort of silent movie comedian.|Fresh
Several of the best lines come with a bit too big of a wink at the teen movie formula, which lends to a sense of irony that lingers around the edges of the otherwise deeply sincere film.|Fresh
This is an old-fashioned stop-motion animation treat, its lighthearted, an easy to navigate adventure and coming of age story aimed at young people.|Fresh
Though his hand on the musical cues is heavy, Knight's touch is light on the film as a whole, and Bumblebee breathes.|Fresh
The film is like a cool car with a charismatic driver at the wheel ... (that regularly) turns into a robot that's not as interesting.|Fresh
Lighter, tighter, and as much a Mean Girls/Iron Giant mashup as it is a Transformers movie.|Fresh
Not only is this shockingly good, it functions as a solid coming of age story, not just as a franchise reset for an until now awful series of film.|Fresh
[Bumblebee] mostly feels like a cold-blooded blockbuster masquerading as something warm and earnest.|Fresh
Nostalgic without being mindlessly retro; a sweet, heartfelt girl-and-her-alien-robot-car action-adventure buddy dramedy that hits all the right notes. Hailee Steinfeld is terrific, and there's not a whiff of Michael Bay to be found.|Fresh
Bumblebee feels like the Transformers movie we should have gotten in the first place: a slice of family-friendly fun.|Fresh
It has taken the franchise more than a decade to get its act together, but finally we get to experience what a Transformers movie should have been all along.|Fresh
Steinfeld injects the right mix of sparky teen angst and feisty humour, adding layers to each scene that builds Iron Giant-style emotions between this girl and her car.|Fresh
Everything about Bumblebee feels like a fresh start for the franchise: director Travis Knight strips down the Transformers aesthetic to something cleaner and more coherent...|Fresh
Michael Bay always had the right idea by injecting humor into these movies, but Travis Knight has refined the jokes here while Christina Hodson has penned a script that understands both Transformers lore and the frustrated emotions of its central heroine|Fresh
Backed up by some terrific visual effects, which crucially never overwhelm, the performances are also credible. When Steinfeld looks at Bumblebee, you believe her attachment to him. Now if only Michael Bay had tried that.|Fresh
There are real emotional stakes, an appealing 1980s look and some genuinely funny jokes.|Fresh
The metal-on-metal violence here won't blow you away, if that's what the Bay movies did. Bumblebee is much smaller in scale, and all the better for it.|Fresh
The movie features such a charming coming-of-age story that it's sort of a shame it has to incorporate so much Transformers mythology.|Fresh
Bumblebee works because it dares to tap into a new dimension in this franchise: Legitimate emotional reactions. We humans like to refer to them as feelings!|Fresh
It's even better than a formal apology for Transformers: The Last Knight.|Fresh
While Bumblebee has evidently been designed as a film that adults and children can enjoy on different levels, this risks leaving both somewhat unsatisfied.|Rotten
The script stays on safe, formulaic ground, but it's effective - and somehow breathes new life into a franchise that had become a junk heap.|Fresh
As the first spinoff to come out of the Transformers movie franchise, Oscar-nominated director Travis Knight has managed to distinguish Bumblebee from the cinematic trash heap of spare parts that director Michael Bay has produced for the past decade.|Fresh
This is the Transformers film we wanted all along|Fresh
Better-than-expected Transformers prequel is big on action.|Fresh
Tones down everything that made its predecessors weak, while adding humor, emotion and a surprising amount of heart.|Fresh
Bumblebee rekindles the spirit of the cartoon, while adding an unexpected dose of warmth and humor. It is the best film in the Transformers franchise since the live action original.|Fresh
Bumblebee is a considerable upgrade on the previous films in the Transformers series.|Fresh
Maybe the key to getting a good Transformers movie this whole time was simply hiring a woman to write the screenplay.|Fresh
You generally see this sort of dramatic turnaround only in sport. We wish it great prosperity in the new year.|Fresh
The Transformers franchise was dead in the water after the last outing but Bumblebeehelps give it the ounce of freshness that it so desperately needed.|Fresh
Finds a little charm in going back to the story's children's entertainment roots -- just not a lot of entertainment|Rotten
The movie belongs to 22-year-old Steinfeld, who holds it together, reminding everyone why she is an Oscar nominee.|Fresh
Instead of staging a bombastic action cheesefest, Bumblebee self-consciously apes the style of 1980s coming-of-age stories, to great effect.|Fresh
Steinfeld is an enormously talented actress, and the film knows to spend some time with her and not try to hurry things along to the next big set piece.|Fresh
For his live-action debut, Knight slips into Bay boomboom mode.|Rotten
Bumblebee exudes some of the tediousness of a reformed sinner who decries hedonism, trying hard to convince us that it now believes in something.|Rotten
Even if you despise the franchise, BUMBLEBEE is worth seeing.|Fresh
[Christina Hodson's script] finds the right balance between propelling the story forward and developing character, while John Cena (Blockers) does well as the human villain of the piece.|Fresh
Bumblebee is an incredibly nice breath of fresh air compared to the previous Transformers movies.|Fresh
"Can a ""Transformers"" movie be good? It turns out the answer is yes - if the right talent is given enough leeway."|Fresh
Who woulda thunk it? A Transformers movie with heart and soul. And great music.|Fresh
Best of the live-action Transformers movies thus far!|Fresh
Although Bumblebee isn't perfect and suffers from some of the side effects of being a blockbuster film it has more heart than any of the previous entries.|Fresh
"Six movies into this franchise, I expected to write ""Bumblebee"" off as another ""Transformers"" cash grab. But it's one of the most unexpectedly heartwarming and fun movies you'll watch this holiday."|Fresh
Bumblebee may sport a thoughtful character arc and a throwback vibe, but it's not meaningfully different than the other five entries in the Transformers series.|Rotten
Bumblebee is the Transformers franchise sobering up after a decade-long bender.|Fresh
An absolute charmer. This is the best Transformers movie to date, and Hailee Steinfeld's best role. Little kids - and people who were Transformers fans as little kids - will especially love this.|Fresh
It's a charming tale of a girl and her adorable car-robot, flipping the script on the tired, bloated franchise. While hard-core fan-boys may complain it's too soft, this film may turn out to be the perfect way to save Transformers.|Fresh
Bumblebee isn't another dark, grim ogre of a film. It's a breezy, fun, smart picture directed by someone with a keen eye for details, but also for humanity.|Fresh
The best Transformers movie, for whatever that's worth.|Fresh
A not-bad origin story about one of the more more agreeable Transformers.|Fresh
Bumblebee is a welcome reboot for a troubled franchise. Hailee Steinfeld is charming and the story entertaining enough, even if conventional.|Fresh
"Stands on its own, apart from its predecessors as a faithful and pretty fantastic ""Transformers"" installment."|Fresh
Bumblebee remembers its geared toward the youngsters, and doesn't forget to sprinkle a touch of humanity along the way. At last, this could be the Transformers flick you've all been anticipating.|Fresh
"It's happened, sound the sirens - ""Autobots, roll out""...because Bumblebee is the best Transformers movie of them all."|Fresh
It does everything the Bay movies wouldn't, embracing what's made Transformers endure for three decades, and infusing it with a much-needed dose of heart.|Fresh
Tears and thrills for all the family.|Fresh
I think most fans will just be happy that there's a Transformers movie honoring the legacy. Fans can breathe a nice sigh of relief.|Fresh
It's amazing how well a Transformers movie can work when liberated from the worst excessive tendencies of Michael Bay.|Fresh
[Cena] gives good muscle, but Bumblebee brings something even more important - and actually transforming - to the series: a sense of humor, and a heart.|Fresh
It's a Transformers movie to enjoy and even care about... and one capable of turning around this franchise's fortunes for the better.|Fresh
'Bumblebee' is the best live-action 'Transformers' to date, but is that good enough in 2018?|Fresh
Bumblebee is a fun, heartfelt and still action-filled Transformers prequel that ushers in a new - and better - era of movies about the Autobots.|Fresh
The Transformers franchise has given us a breath of fresh air with their latest venture, Bumblebee; the first film in the franchise filled with ample amounts of heart, humor, fun and memorable action!|Fresh
It's certainly a high for the franchise.|Fresh
Bumblebee is one of the strongest films in the franchise and a rebirth for the series going forward.|Fresh
"Flavorful popcorn entertainment and does a fine job reclaiming the core appeal of ""Transformers,"" even if it's something as small as an iconic sound effect or character design that's recognizable."|Fresh
Bumblebee is a surprisingly enjoyable ride for a franchise that felt like it'd long since rusted over.|Fresh
"For the last 10 years we've just been walking through the desert with Michael Bay and finally this director comes up and says, ""I've got that cool water for you."" And this movie is refreshing."|Fresh
The Hollywood machine has retooled the Transformers franchise for a sleeker, quicker and more enjoyable ride in this character driven prequel.|Fresh
Bumblebee is the Transformers movie that should have been made in the first place.|Fresh
But Travis Knight's spin-off/ prequel shrewdly -- and successfully -- sidelines the mechanics and mythology of its predecessors to focus on the changing emotional conditions of its characters.|Fresh
Doesn't just add an invigorating (all)spark to the Transformers franchise, but it also proves that there truly is more than meets the eye.|Fresh
If you like Eighties movies, coming of age stories, or giant robots fighting, Bumblebee is for you.|Fresh
Brimming with fun and charming scenes, a compelling story, and a great hero in Hailee Steinfeld, Bumblebee is a joyride of a film. Way more than meets the eye.|Fresh
[It's] a crowd-pleaser of a movie, and it hits all the necessary beats... The movie succeeds where all of Bay's films failed because, despite being a story centered on battling robots, Bumblebee never loses sight of its humanity.|Fresh
Bumblebee was quite a wonderful experience even for this non-Transformers fan. I can only imagine that true fans should be thrilled that a movie finally captures what they love about those robots.|Fresh
[Knight] replaces Bay's occasionally enticing flair with a series of ... uninteresting visual and storytelling choices that have been seemingly dictated by ... focus groups.|Rotten
It takes all of 30 seconds into Bumblebee for it to be the best live-action Transformers movie.|Fresh
Perhaps the most impressive thing you could say about Bumblebee is that it actually leaves you wanting another Transformers movie.|Fresh
With a narrative on a decidedly smaller scale, a plot that's entirely coherent, and a hefty dose of warmth and heart, 'Bumblebee' is the much-needed and richly-entertaining departure the Transformers franchise so desperately needed.|Fresh
For true Transformers fans this prequel will serve as a melancholic coming-of-age journey into the backstory of Bee and a great 'restart' to the direction of the film series as a whole.|Fresh
...a fun, well-acted, exciting and even emotional piece of popcorn action.|Fresh
In a better, truer cinematic universe, Travis Knight would have been in charge of the Transformers franchise all along.|Fresh
"It's a movie more Iron Giant than Armageddon, though unlike the Vin Diesel-voiced Brad Bird creation, no Autobot will be able to insist they're ""not a gun"" forever"|Fresh
An impassioned ode to both the toys and their era, this, at last, is the Transformers movie we've been waiting for.|Fresh
It was nice to enjoy a Transformers movie again.|Fresh
"Fans of the classic ""Transformers"" will be thrilled by many of the touches here. But there is also now an entire generation of kids who are going to get to watch a girl drive, with a smile on her face."|Fresh
Feels less like another Transformers film as we've come to know them than a live-action spin on the classic Ted Hughes-inspired animation The Iron Giant, slathered in John Hughes-esque coming-of-age trimmings.|Fresh
Knight and Hodson have salvaged something agreeable from an otherwise badly dented series.|Fresh
"""Bumblebee,"" for its part, has just enough wit, playfulness and charm to develop a voice of its own, which is no small thing in the context of a flashy, lunkheaded studio franchise."|Fresh
It's an effective reimagining that also bears a knowing resemblance to classic youth-oriented films from Bumblebee executive producer Steven Spielberg.|Fresh
"""Bumblebee"" is basically the movie that fans of the 1980s animated series wanted all along."|Fresh
I'm as surprised as anyone that I'm about to write this sentence, but here it goes anyway: Bumblebee is a delight.|Fresh
"Charm and sweetness were in short supply in Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" films, but they're the secret ingredients to ""Bumblebee,"" a likeable prequel that indulges in nostalgic affection for all things 1980s."|Fresh
As a course correction for the series, pulling the previously complex mythology way back and starting over from scratch, it's enormously effective.|Fresh
The live-action Transformers movie we all wanted in the '80s.|Fresh
