... quiet film with a sense of serenity interspersed with scenes of fantasy and wonder-dreams, stories, and moments of magic that may or may not be all in the creative imagination of the characters-and images of daily life of Japan in 1814.|Fresh
The overall tone is so uneven, and that blaring rock soundtrack so intrusive, the artistry of Miss Hokusai gets lost in translation.|Rotten
The film is a curious mixture of everyday life in 19th century Japan and weird supernatural spookiness.|Fresh
Miss Hokusai mostly gets by on atmosphere, but it's a fantastic example of the wide variety found in Japanese animation.|Fresh
You won't stick with Miss Hokusai because you absolutely must know what happens next. Sometimes it's worth sticking with something just to be immersed.|Fresh
Miss Hokusai gets jarred by a few too-modern music-moments and some preciousness in Ōi and Onao's sisterhood, but otherwise it's a steady sail through one woman's artscape and life that can't be entirely her own.|Fresh
Told through the eyes of Hokusai's daughter as she attempts to forge a destiny of her own out of her father's shadow, Miss Hokusai is animation for adults that packs an emotional punch.|Fresh
While the emphasis on suggestion over standard biopic spectacle is novel, one suspects the film probably won't be suggestive, coherent or affecting enough for hardcore Hokusai admirers, leaving it to occupy a curious artistic no-man's-land.|Rotten
A film with an appealing sensibility that invites the public into a dream world where eroticism, sarcasm, comedy, and nostalgia dwell in every scene. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Japanese animated drama Miss Hokusai is a unique, fascinating oddity. It's a strong historical drama, and a serious one. Yet it's occasionally joke-y, often uneven, and occasionally difficult to follow.|Fresh

Visually gorgeous but doesn't adequately capture a compelling figure.|Fresh
I found myself less immersed in the showy dreamlike vignettes than with the film's exploration of the inner-turmoil that inspired Hokusai's astonishing canvases.|Fresh
Animation isn't the usual style associated with biopics, though there have been some sterling examples... To those can now be added Miss Hokusai.|Fresh
A visually rich look at the often messy act of creation.|Fresh
Japanese animation meets its own origins in Miss Hokusai, a lovingly crafted tale of art and life in early-18th-century Japan.|Fresh
"""Miss Hokusai"" can be an abrupt picture, but it retains sizable charisma and artistry, locating a few emotional moments that work exceptionally well."|Fresh
A sumptuous tapestry of color, shadow, and light.|Fresh
If you adjust to the movie's unusual rhythms and submit to director Hara (whose credits include the similarly singular Colourful), you'll find yourself having a lovely, quietly soulful experience.|Fresh
Historical Japanese character study has mature content.|Fresh
Miss Hokusai bleeds style and grace from every frame to the extent that you can almost smell the ink as it's pressed to a paper canvas. For the imaginative and the admirers of the fantastical, this film is purely and spectacularly a work of art.|Fresh
This historical biography is a quiet examination of a father and daughter/master and apprentice as they ply their copious talents to create works of art for their patrons.|Fresh
An important and mature film about 19th century Japanese artist Hokusai and his brilliant, perhaps equally talented daughter.|Fresh
Set in the 1800s during the final years of the Edo period, the film reimagines that era with dozens of lovely details.|Fresh
We watch the visions of her imagination, from dragons in the sky, on down, transformed into art.|Fresh
Director Keiichi Hara achieves a balance between earthiness and aestheticism, suggesting a Japan on the cusp of modernity.|Fresh
It feels much longer than its 90 minutes, and I left it feeling like I didn't really learn much about its title character or her father.|Rotten
Hara's use of exaggerated sound compensating for O'Nao's lack of sight [is] even more compelling than his visuals...easily one of the best animations of the year|Fresh
A slim, brief affair ... but the brevity may well be part of the reason the film stays with us.|Fresh
While it's not entirely kid-friendly, this portrait of an artist is both enchanting and thought provoking.|Fresh
Creating worlds with images is a form of magic. Miss Hokusai demonstrates that simply, with its extraordinary simulation of sunlight streaming through O'Ei's spread fingers.|Fresh
It is just an exquisitely lovely, emotionally mature film that is deeply satisfying precisely because of the sadness in its soul.|Fresh
[An] unusual, visually adventurous animated feature, simultaneously modern and steeped in Japanese culture and history.|Fresh
A gorgeous animated tale of love, family and art set during Japan's Edo period.|Fresh
Miss Hokusai is a lovely biopic, even if it never quite picks up and focuses on a single thread. (Then again, neither does life.)|Fresh
Magical and melancholy, tender and robust.|Fresh
"The ""roaming hands"" dream is one of Miss Hokusai's most memorable set pieces, but it's far from the only standout."|Fresh
That an anime film can explore such complex subjects so beautifully in what's nominally an artist's biopic is a blessing in itself.|Fresh
It is an interesting work, delicately and discreetly animated, with a quiet visual coup in its final moments when the Edo (as it was then called) of 1814 is dreamily replaced by the Tokyo of the 21st century.|Fresh
The annals of Western art are woefully sparse when it comes to female painters, which is just one of perhaps a dozen reasons that Miss Hokusai comes as such a refreshing anomaly among anime exports.|Fresh
It condenses everyday interactions, memories, and dreams into a potent mix of all the major ingredients of a well-lived life.|Fresh
Miss Hokusai is a thoughtful and visually resplendent anime with a playful interpretation of art and artists.|Fresh
Miss Hokusai can sometimes feel a little too light on its feet, with a tendency to meander from the narrative path, but its dipping in and out of various lives and dramas, makes it all the more vibrant and unique.|Fresh
With Hinako Sugiura's historical manga 'Sarusuberi' as his inspiration, director Keiichi Hara and screenwriter Miho Maruo have pared down the episodic source material to create a work that is truly magical: must-see storytelling at its finest.|Fresh
More impressionistic and contemplative than dramatic and analytical, this is an intriguing memoir of a significant female artist.|Fresh
Miss Hokusai is a high-profile Japanese anime that is completely (and refreshingly) devoid of fantastical creatures, floating castles and sharpshooting cyborgs.|Fresh
The beautiful animation is a strong selling point: it's detailed and realistic, with some frames deliberately echoing well-known prints by Hokusai.|Fresh
