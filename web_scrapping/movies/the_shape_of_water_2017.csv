If The Shape of Water were purely focused on Eliza and the creature with deity-like properties, it would be a pure shot of cinematic ecstasy.|Fresh
A crystallization of timeless themes with exhilarating emotional frankness, spacious humanism, and extravagant style.|Fresh
Guillermo del Toro's latest ask us about tolerance in a dark time in history where intolerance seems to be the root of all out tragedies. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Neil Gaiman once wrote that America is no place for gods. But is it no place for fairy tales? Guillermo del Toro would say no.|Fresh
An undeniably gorgeous film, bathed in a radiant, emerald glow and fully embracing its early '60s backdrop that allows it to take on an old-Hollywood aesthetic.|Fresh
Want to see a movie that pulses with an abundance of pure creativity and vision? This is it.|Fresh
[Guillermo] del Toro's love of nostalgia gets in the way of moving the story forward. It has a familiarity that hinders the newness and excitement of the downright incredible moments of character.|Fresh
Del Toro hits another grand slam with the production design, but the movie really wins because of it's honest approach.|Fresh
With its art-deco gothic look and haunting score courtesy of Alexandre Desplat, The Shape of Water is one of the most unique films to come out this year.|Fresh
I didn't find this iteration of a familiar myth very effective or affecting. Maybe you'll love this frog prince more than I did.|Rotten
The Shape of Water elevates beyond genre expectations... an unexpected, deeply personal adventure that will captivate any audience willing to give it a chance.|Fresh
The Shape of Water may be the most stunning film I have ever seen. Visually, it draws you in with gorgeous creature design and fascinating use of colors. The performances are absolutely outstanding, and the characters are fascinating.|Fresh
The film does all feel rather insubstantial though and a touch 'second hand' by its final reel. Emotionally, visually and contextually it's all a little passé.|Rotten
Cinematic perfection at its purest.|Fresh
At its core, The Shape of Water is a film about being seen as a person without any asterisks.|Fresh
[Hawkins is] utterly mesmerizing to watch even in scenes where she's not attempting to seduce a man-phibian.|Fresh
The visuals are stunning ... but those visuals are even more memorable because of the tone of empathy that del Toro injects into it all.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is a lush, moving love story that sees a softer, tenderer side of Guillermo del Toro without sacrificing those qualities that make him one of the most unique filmmakers of his generation.|Fresh
While the genres don't always seem to be the right fit, del Toro makes it work, thanks to some beautiful imagery and a strong cast.|Fresh
These waters might run strongly, but they're far muddier than they should be.|Rotten
I am head over heels in love with Guillermo del Toro's latest picture.|Fresh
The Shape of Water shows us that it's never too late to be understood or seen. Look beyond surfaces and see with your heart.|Fresh
It's about the way our sexuality reveals ourselves and how sex allows us to connect with others in meaningful ways. But mostly, it's about a woman f*cking a fish monster.|Fresh
It is a beautiful, evocative and captivating film, guaranteed to resonate with audiences old and young. Simply put, it is one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
A teal-coloured passion project for del Toro where emotion and ideas and visual splendour swim together in harmony.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is visionary filmmaking.|Fresh
So, while we know Elisa has humanity, Del Toro has to plead his case for the fish-man.|Fresh
Hawkins shines in the role, bringing a vitality and sense of spirit to the part.|Fresh
The filmmaker's fearless commitment to his vision, supported by a fantastic cast and well-chosen talent in every category from makeup to musical score, has made this unlikely concept a strange but fascinating triumph of creative confidence.|Fresh
A magical transcendence that makes you leave the cinema floating.|Fresh
The film proves that intentional ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean a story ends unsettled. That it doesn't explicitly tell you which interpretation to have makes all of them more powerful.|Fresh
If all we're going to get from del Toro now are on are R-rated films, then I would want them to all feel like this.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is subversive without meaning to be political. It invites us to consider the strange, romantic pairing of its two main characters, and in challenging us with this vision, it challenges us to consider how we view each other.|Fresh
Guillermo Del Toro, takes the story of this unlikely duo and makes it not only believable but sorrowful, lyrical, mystical, mythical, strange, and, well, magic.|Fresh
The pride Del Toro takes in his world-building, and the creation of his characters and monsters, is a sheer wonder that continues to amaze me. The Shape of Water is no different.|Fresh
As an actress who utters not a single word, Hawkins give a profound performance, creating a breathtaking understanding of her longing to be loved.|Fresh
There is so much to delight visually here as well as the beautiful and captivating film score. It's a striking masterpiece that flows just like water.|Fresh
The Shape of Water may too obviously foreshadow how these characters will eventually collide violently and ideologically, but del Toro's pop storytelling remains so effortlessly jazzy and hypnotic that it hardly matters.|Fresh
The scenes underwater, specifically with Elisa and the Amphibious Man are mesmerizing and incredibly sensual; a beautiful fluidity with the motions of the characters.|Fresh
This movie, like its title, is extremely hard to define...it doesn't fit neatly in any genre...and it's best to let it wash over you.|Fresh
... has the seriousness and innocence of A Monster Calls while indulging in an R-rated adult fantasy romance, an amazing line to walk and all the better for it.|Fresh
Del Toro has such a distinct vision for his films and never disappoints on delivering a world so vibrant and stunning.|Fresh
I commend [The Shape of Water] for daring to be different. It plays with an old type of story and creates something that is entirely its own.|Fresh
"A captivating ode to monster movies past with a passionately inclusive message that units a group of ""others"" in their fight against the oppressive majority."|Fresh
Del Toro takes the central relationship seriously, and the weight of the villain makes us care for the characters and hope they'll be buoyed by their friendships.|Fresh
Such an out of the ordinary picture demands an unconventional heroine and del Toro could not have chosen better than Hawkins.|Fresh
The progressive agenda wins the Oscar! Love that! Wait, nope-I draw the line at interspecies carnality. When protesting persecution and lauding universal love, at least pick a metaphor not as universally reviled as bestiality. It's not twee, it's gross.|Rotten
As the title implies, this is a movie that surrounds the viewer's psyche and physical being. It is a film that achieves everything it sets out to accomplish.|Fresh
"In this, del Toro asks ""what if the monster got the girl?"". It's a strange question with weird answers, but one he poses with beauty, delicacy and intelligence."|Fresh
... a feast for the eyes and the rest of the senses... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Often morose, it livens up when Shannon is tasering the fishman or engaged in bloodletting and beatings. It is a kind of horror movie, it's true, but those scenes overpower the film's invocation of desperate forbidden love.|Rotten
Sally Hawkins delivers a performance of a lifetime...A visually stunning adventure that's part monster film, part romantic fable, and part Cold War thriller, The Shape of Water is a playground for some of Del Toro's favourite themes.|Fresh
Why did The Shape of Water win the Oscar as Best Picture?|Fresh
Effectively a remake of Ron Howard's Splash with the first act excised.|Rotten
A universal power flows through this impressive film of love. It's perfect. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Shape of Water is a fascinating experience both in an emotional and an intellectual level, and one of Guillermo del Toro's best movies. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...a tribute to the classic genres filled with creativity, lyricism and allegorical spirit. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Elisa [is] played with subtle mastery by Sally Hawkins.|Fresh
Del Toro shows that fantasy and reality are not opposed, confronted worlds, but are part of a single universe. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
For all its cosmic tingles, del Toro manages to smuggle a deeply personal film across Hollywood's border where, beneath its haunted charm, lies an immigrant's story rising to the surface, setting us adrift in a dream.|Fresh
The film fits [Guillermo del Toro's] elegance, his sensitivity, his good handling of the language of film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[A] virtuous and thorough fable. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Easily del Toro's best English-language work, The Shape of Water is not simply a triumph, but a reminder of what it is to fall in love with cinema.|Fresh
The actors are in perfect harmony with the story and the emotional core is never lost thanks to a masterful interpretation by Sally Hawkins. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a film that doesn't want to be categorised, but it's no trouble at all to lose yourself in its swirling currents.|Fresh
If we can't believe in the characters, how are we supposed to care?|Rotten
It sounds ridiculous, yet through some magical alchemy it works - magnificently so.|Fresh
It is made with the absolute, dead-centre sincerity of a child righting an ancient wrong, and the craft of a film-maker at the height of his powers. It is also unexpectedly kinky in ways that deepen it into something genuinely rich and strange.|Fresh
A beautiful homage to cinema, its moral is far from subtle, but Sally Hawkins's wonderful performance raises it from cute oddity to emotional journey.|Fresh
On the one hand, The Shape of Water plays out like a forgotten instalment of The Twilight Zone. On the other, it makes for an attractive date movie. Seriously, who'd have thought that something so bizarre could be so romantic?|Fresh
A film about films, and a lush Cold War melodrama involving an interspecies romance that should be creepy but isn't, Guillermo del Toro's Shape of Water is an unexpected and irresistible delight.|Fresh
Del Toro creates a beautifully imagined world, rich in colours and characters, with touches of humour and social commentary.|Fresh
Shot in blue and green hues, the emotionally charged film is a visual feast.|Fresh
It is an entertaining and acceptable film, but... at times gives the feeling that we are facing a succession of Hollywood patterns. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What could be Amelie-style tweeness is invested with warmth, beauty and a surprisingly deep emotional richness.|Fresh
As she did in the under-garlanded Maudie, Sally Hawkins reminds us that there is nobody better at turning robust fragility into something other than a paradox.|Fresh
This is a film made by a boy who loves monsters, who has grown up to understand what they might represent to an adult woman, other outsiders (a gay man, a communist sleeper, a black woman) and an unforgiving society.|Fresh
Hawkins's performance throughout is career-defining. With her eyes, mouth and physicality, she finds a level of emotional eloquence to render speech redundant.|Fresh
Sally Hawkins carries the film. Elisa may not speak but you are never in doubt about what she is feeling as Hawkins makes her shine with an inner resolve.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is a wild ride that provides many unexpected, eye-raising moments.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is the world as Guillermo del Toro sees it - full of injustice, but also, crucially, decency. Where others see pain, he sees hope, where others see fear, he sees compassion, where others see monsters, he sees friends.|Fresh
I felt nothing for the characters which makes the premise of rooting for the misunderstood a moot point.|Rotten
All plot holes can be subsumed within the magical-realist tone for which Del Toro is famed. Yet there's an uncomfortable tension between the film's whimsical, Amélie-light (or, lighter) style and its clumsy political point-scoring.|Rotten
I liked it well enough, but not as much as I should have.|Fresh
More than its visual brilliance, what captivates you the most is Del Toro's ability to capture the minutiae of his ordinary characters' everyday life.|Fresh
Like the water of its title, the film is deep, mysterious, sparkling in some places and ominously murky in others; and containing wonders few can imagine.|Fresh
Refreshingly, the film doesn't shy away from its characters' desires... The Shape of Water spells out in letters taller than the Empire State Building exactly what Fay Wray and King Kong wanted to do all along.|Fresh
The Shape of Water almost drowns in its own gorgeousness. It is a Beauty and the Beast fable where both get to be beautiful and neither has to be beastly.|Fresh
This is a mesmerising, profoundly emotional tale of vulnerable outsiders - and it's beyond gorgeous to look at.|Fresh
From the world's most over-rated A-list director, Guillermo del Toro, comes yet another visually distinctive, tonally flat work of glum fantasy...As usual, Del Toro's acolytes have promptly fallen into line praising this overlong pseudo sci-fi pap.|Rotten
Del Toro's greatest work. Simply magnificent.|Fresh
Maybe it's not Del Toro's best movie, but it's one of the best movies we're going to see this year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Creating a convincing romance between a woman and a fishman is probably the film's biggest challenge, but sensitive performances ... make it not just believable but compelling.|Fresh
The aural icing on this cinematic cake is Alexandre Desplat's action-reinforcing original score.|Fresh
Del Toro also dedicates himself, professing his affection and admiration for cinema, paying homage, but very much in his own style. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Del Toro's Valentine to boundary-crossing love pours from the screen in ravishing torrents of feeling and style. And Hawkins is sublime.|Fresh
It's the biggest risk of del Toro's career and it could not have paid off more.|Fresh
If I had more stars to give 'The Shape of Water,' you'd see an entire constellation before you.|Fresh
Pulses attractively like a luminous toyshop novelty; one inspired by The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954).|Fresh
This is a monster movie made with real love.|Fresh
Guillermo del Toro's wildly imaginative adult fairytale is an opulently entertaining monster fable that is spectacularly stylised and perversely enchanting.|Fresh
Guillermo del Toro's best movie in years...|Fresh
Certainly sufficiently engaging and visually-captivating to recommend for open-minded fans of the supernatural.|Fresh
This beautiful fable could be a Disney animation - if it wasn't for the sex and all the graphic violence. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
The Shape of Water is Guillermo del Toro's best film since Pan's Labyrinth. A charming, heartwarming modern fairytale with not an ounce of flotsam or jetsam, it's an idiosyncratic delight to behold.|Fresh
Sally Hawkins brings a combination of frailty and strength to her part in this movie that makes her performance the pillar on which everything else stands.|Fresh
... the director's imagination gives it an authentic vintage texture and enough doses of shocks and blood.|Fresh
In The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro plays the hits. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Del Toro's best work to date. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Never could the phrase ""an instant classic"" be applied so well. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
It is this adult fairy tale's uninhibited embrace of love in all its euphoric glory that renders The Shape of Water such an unexpected delight.|Fresh
A unique and original science fiction love story that is sometimes weighed down too heavily by an unoriginal villain plot line.|Fresh
A tonally bonkers high-gloss mainstream-adjacent oddity ... Spielberg crossed with Jean-Pierre Jeunet crossed with David Cronenberg ... full of childlike wonder but also a childish desire to shock.|Fresh
A picturesque fairytale told by a masterful storyteller, this monster movie from director Guillermo del Toro is the most emotionally resonant of his career.|Fresh
"Del Toro's ""Shape"" holds water."|Fresh
While Sally Hawkins has been an exemplary actor for a long time now - go find her stunning work in last year's Maudie if you missed it - she takes everything to an imposing, yet intimate new level in The Shape of Water.|Fresh
"""The Shape of Water"" feels like it's yet another Del Toro work that would not be denied. Set amongst the ideological flux beneath the shiny cordiality of 60s post war America, instead of the Spanish Civil War, lies an escapist wonder."|Fresh
Sally Hawkins never talks in the movie, and I take that for granted a lot of the time...she doesn't say a word in the movie, but she says so much, which is a lot of damn talent.|Fresh
It is a story about outsiders and the very human need to connect. It is also about the love of movies, both the craft of movies and the way stories on screen captivate us and transport to another world.|Fresh
... Del Toro's willingness to court absurdity and bad taste serves to guarantee his integrity, proving he hasn't entirely gone respectable.|Fresh
The beauty of this film is Del Toro's gift of telling fantastical stories, but still giving them heart and crafting well-rounded characters throughout.|Fresh
The Shape of Water may be the balm or the escape we needed. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This mash-up of alien and immigrant hardship, in which lonely Elisa finds sexual release with a sea creature, is pervy, ridiculous, and humorless.|Rotten
Shannon, Jenkins, Spencer and Michael Stuhlbarg all turn in fine work here, but this is still all about Jones and Hawkins.|Fresh
It's essentially like Bioshock meets The Creature from the Black Lagoon which, yes, is very weird, but it makes for an amazing movie.|Fresh
... while there are several beautiful, aquatic set-pieces, the story shuffles predictably towards its conflict and conclusion. For those who want look and feel, this may be enough.|Fresh
A visually spectacular fairytale, The Shape of Water is a dazzling film, anchored by a masterful performance from the effervescent Sally Hawkins.|Fresh
While the parallels Del Toro is drawing will be too clunky for some, the film's huge heart and good intentions are always on display.|Fresh
While Hawkins and the supporting cast give great performances, Shannon steals the show.|Fresh
I suspect that many audiences may cringe at this film, or possibly be repulsed by it, but those who accept its weird premise will have their hearts and imaginations plucked.|Fresh
What a wonder! [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Del Toro's absolute love for his craft and this story comes cascading out of every frame.|Fresh
It is at the same time many things that came before it, and something altogether new. To experience it is to love it.|Fresh
As an oddly engaging romance, The Shape Of Water floats.|Fresh
For all its many accomplishments, the film falls a little short. I am not often enough moved by the film, and not entirely engaged to let it flow through my subconscious, as perhaps intended.|Rotten
As enigmatic as its title. An exquisite piece of visceral filmmaking that leads with the heart...|Fresh
The best fantastic cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
On paper it may sound indigestible, but on screen it's pure magic.|Fresh
Guillermo del Toro invites us to take a touristic dip in his dreams... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a gorgeous, sensual film, a tale filled with kindness and evil and the battle between the two. Be sure to suspend disbelief at the door.|Fresh
... A testament to the power of love, a force so strong it transcends the human constructs of speech and language ...|Fresh
The flamboyantly peculiar erotics Shape of Water have not stopped critics and audiences from applauding it as a masterpiece. I applaud it for a different reason: for its ability to make a freaky fable about interspecies sex go mainstream.|Fresh
What I can't forgive is how static and simplistic these characters are [...] With no ambiguity, there's nothing for my brain to do except passively watch these soggy characters as they wade to a predictable, saccharine conclusion.|Rotten
"Without being obvious about it, ""The Shape of Water"" is a moving fable about outsiders and tolerance, about seeing beyond differences and finding connection; it is a soaring, magical joyride that gives new life to a tale as old as time."|Fresh
Del Toro's typically lusty visuals and the impressive mix of practical and computer-enhanced effects that comprise his fish-man smother the would-be intricacies of his drama.|Rotten
A sea of perfectly assembled elements, The Shape of Water truly feels like a film that no one else could have made.|Fresh
For me, this manner of finding your beloved pretty much died with the tide.|Rotten
The Shape of Water is a cinematic fight for that world, one that could be born out of creativity and dreaming. Out of romance. Out of the movies.|Fresh
Del Toro's sheer joy of filmmaking is contagious, from precision chase scenes and glimpses of period TV shows like Mr. Ed and Dobie Gillis, cannily chosen to inform the story, to his gleeful homage to vintage Hollywood musicals...|Fresh
For all the sumptuous style and lush visuals, The Shape of Water is, at its heart, a simple fish-out-of-water story, both figuratively and literally.|Fresh
A magnificent story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Shape of Water is a eternal story for our time, about loving and being loved, speaking and being heard, and compassion for humanity.|Fresh
The most elaborate explication to date of del Toro's belief that monsters, like traditional religious martyrs, are 'innocents' whose torments testify to their 'state of grace.'|Fresh
A splendid entertainment, well-modulated by a steady directorial hand, and sincere in its depiction of individuals whose physical limits are meant to propel them towards wondrous - if suspenseful - adventures.|Fresh
Film making at its best. Great story, great cast and a lesson to be learned for those who care.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is both surprisingly sweet and shockingly sexy. And it's one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
The Shape of Water adds the species barrier to [the film's] group of segregating factors, and in so doing folds in an even larger idea, namely good old-fashioned biophilia.|Fresh
This holiday's most romantic and life-affirming feature might be The Shape of Water, which depicts a virtually silent love affair between a cleaning woman and humanoid river monster.|Fresh
Each piece fits gently, irresistibly into place making The Shape of Water one of the year's finest films.|Fresh
Del Toro makes it work using every tool in his formidable tool box, which include a textural richness in production design typical of the director.|Fresh
The thematic masochism is intrinsic to del Toro's art - miserably picking the scab of one's self-esteem. But the architecture here is too cardboard, despite a high level of craft among the cast, to make us feel the pain, too.|Rotten
With visuals offering unique worlds that somehow weave into a fantastical whole, this film makes for one extraordinary water ballet.|Fresh
The film is the equivalent work of an artist, who, though beginning with a solid, well-rounded image...just didn't allow it to find the proper balance. In the end, perhaps The Shape of Water's ambition just exceeded its grasp.|Rotten
Del Toro is simply too talented a visual stylist to produce something dull and inanimate, but he goes so overboard, it seems, you either buy in and swoon, or stand there shaking your head.|Fresh
A picture postcard in production design, del Toro's talents have never been better used.|Fresh
A creature-feature romance that splashes about with enchanting warmth and an open heart.|Fresh
Guillermo del Toro directs this beautifully designed but clumsily arranged sci-fi love story about a mute janitor who falls for a magical creature.|Fresh
There is, to be sure, nothing remotely new about the story of the beauty and the beast... Nevertheless it took audacity and nerves of steel to go all the way with it, which is what del Toro does.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is one of the year's most gorgeous, romantic and unusual films, a fairy tale for troubled times that is full of imagination.|Fresh
Employing some good, old-fashioned movie magic, del Toro has crafted a film that borders on sensory overload. It's wondrous, odd and visually arresting from the opening seconds.|Fresh
Beautiful and occasionally moving, if not quite as emotionally rich as it aims to be.|Fresh
The fact that The Shape of Water's two leads are both incapable of speech doesn't render it any less capable of forging an emotional connection with its audience.|Fresh
A wonderfully weird love story that plays like an adult fairy tale, it's a fantastical delight, one of those rare start-to-finish treats that succeeds on every level.|Fresh
This may not be among Del Toro's best films, but this tender love story fully belongs on the same shelf.|Fresh
That del Toro can seamlessly meld the whimsical, playful and profound into a moving film is a tribute to his formidable imagination.|Fresh
If The Shape of Water never quite breaks out of the confines of what's basically a tale as old as time, it's still an artfully executed diversion further strengthened by an excellent central performance by Hawkins.|Fresh
Guillermo Del Toro's magical masterpiece is simply a fever dream of a romantic movie - and then some.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is breathtaking to behold and the most romantic movie you'll see about a woman falling in love with a fish man.|Fresh
In The Shape of Water, del Toro and co-screenwriter Vanessa Taylor make it appear easy to do something that is really quite difficult-grounding the film from start to finish in a fictional world that has its own inner logic.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is whimsical, boldly original, defiantly weird, occasionally grotesque, and beautifully shot...yet, despite all of that, the film didn't quite work for me.|Rotten
Guillermo del Toro has given us a movie lover's dream in a romantic fantasy/thriller that finds a mute cleaning woman (the brilliant Sally Hawkins) becoming infatuated with the mysterious subject of a top-secret (and mean-spirited) experiment.|Fresh
"Above all, del Toro convincingly pulls us into his world with water defining every scene, the most powerful element that like love, ""takes the shape of the recipient,"" hence the title. Love has no single defined shape or restrictive dimension."|Fresh
The Shape of Water is strange, sweet, and wonderful, and easily the greatest film ever made about a mute cleaning lady who falls in love with an amphibious fish man.|Fresh
del Toro runs with it, delivering his best effort in years, preserving his idiosyncrasies and extremities with an often wonderfully bizarre movie.|Fresh
...you have to admire del Toro for pressing full bore into his make-believe world with such nightmarish whimsy. The embittered, black Cold War coal he collects in The Shape of Water is somehow crushed into a diamond of a film.|Fresh
Enchanting, intelligent, tender, and profoundly human with a perfect balance of Truth and Spectacle. One of the best films of the year!|Fresh
Guillermo del Toro's latest is a virtuosic love letter to classic cinema of multiple eras and genres. It's a shame, then, that it's so lacking in substance and coherent purpose.|Rotten
'The Shape of Water' is one of the best films of the year. It ... has del Toro's fingerprints all over it. It is a dreamy, albeit, at times, violent, feature that is more classic animated Disney than Universal horror, in story and presentation.|Fresh
Director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) has an expansive imagination, but his limitations as a storyteller have created a film that is beautiful but cluttered, visionary but formulaic.|Rotten
I love how del Toro trusts his audience, which means he's willing and daringly able to offer us a dizzying marriage of the sensual and also possible salvation.|Fresh
Del Toro somehow manages to keep the deeply weird mash-up of ideas and images coherent, unified by style and mood.|Fresh
Some of the plot machinations of The Shape of Water don't live up to the magic Hawkins and Jones conjure in their scenes together. When they share the screen, on land or in water, their passion washes over the audience like a cleansing rain.|Fresh
The pieces were there for one of the year's best films, but it may have been better served with a friendship. Fish-men and women can be friends, you know.|Fresh
While viewers may have to suspend disbelief for some of the film's plotting and action, the dazzling combination of romance, fantasy and satire is highly satisfying.|Fresh
A genre picture freighted with allegory -- a good one, just not a great one.|Fresh
The artistic touches of writer-director Guillermo del Toro are evident in this film. The acting is excellent, especially by Sally Hawkins. Michael Shannon is one of the best villains on screen these days, and he is great in this film.|Fresh
Del Toro once again shines and gets the most out of his amazing cast... Sally Hawkins leads an incredible ensemble in one of the most imaginative, emotional films of the year.|Fresh
One of the best movies of the year sees a finely crafted work of imagination from a true master in Guillermo del Toro... it's a triumph of human spirit that isn't necessarily limited to human beings.|Fresh
striking, at times unsettling, and at other times deeply moving|Fresh
Call it a modern-day Creature from the Black Lagoon, or better still call it a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking that knows how to resonate with the audience.|Fresh
"It's the ""Amelie"" and ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" mash-up you never knew you wanted."|Fresh
Sensuous and sumptuous, this poignant, fantastical fable is an enchanting, redemptive, interspecies love story.|Fresh
Eggs, water, and-yes-sex all play crucial and overlapping roles in director Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, an adult fairy tale that is at once deeply familiar and utterly original.|Fresh
Del Toro has given us a small piece of cinematic magic with The Shape of Water.|Fresh
Further makes the case that no one does fantasy on del Toro's level.|Fresh
It's a moving and charming film that doesn't shy away from the ugliness of life, choosing instead to celebrate beauty wherever it may be found.|Fresh
"""A gorgeously rendered story of love, passion, and beauty"""|Fresh
Del Toro exceeds self with this modern fairy-tale/Gothic romance. Hawkins is stunning. The La-La Land of monster movies.|Fresh
The cast is wonderful-Jenkins is warm and lovable, Spencer is funny, and Shannon, as always, plays the perfect snake. But it's Hawkins' silent performance that's the knockout here.|Fresh
... this is one of those adventurous pieces of cinematic imagination I find I like more and more as time goes by.|Fresh
... the film is simply stunning to behold.|Fresh
"Guillermo del Toro returns to fine form with this fairy tale-cum-horror story that effectively echoes the texture, mood and style of his 2006 gem, ""Pan's Labyrinth."""|Fresh
Enchanting and annoying in equal measures.|Rotten
It's a testament to the storyteller's skill that he manages to cram [so much] into his narrative with nary a lump and still keep his characters dancing with only one or two minor missteps.|Fresh
Perhaps never quite as poetic as its wonderful title, The Shape of Water nonetheless allows del Toro to give full vent to an imagination into which movies flow, cinematic tributaries that fuel his sense of invention.|Fresh
"Perhaps [Del Toro's] loveliest film so far, easily on par with his masterpiece ""Pan's Labyrinth."""|Fresh
Few films leave me awestruck for weeks. But the way Guillermo del Toro juggles heart, imagination, suspense, social history, outsider attitude and weird artistry so successfully in this Cold War monster romance continues to astound me.|Fresh
It's gorgeous and weird, heart-wrenching and utterly unforgettable.|Fresh
The Shape of Water opens and closes on a sub-aqueous scene, but everything else about it is buoyant and uplifting.|Fresh
Beautifully shot, designed, and acted but dramatically inert.|Rotten
To see The Shape of Water is to be catapulted into a dream world of dancing raindrops and swirling colours that toggle between scary and cool. Smart money says you'll enjoy the sensation either way.|Fresh
"As much as The Shape of Water's disparate parts shouldn't work - and as much as its ""originality"" is sourced from the thousands of other fables del Toro has consumed over his lifetime - it does, in the end."|Fresh
Hawkins, topping even her remarkable performance in Maudie, is captivating, sad and sensual.|Fresh
In a career of stubbornly idiosyncratic work, it's a masterpiece on par with Pan's Labyrinth, without a hint of creative interference from outside forces.|Fresh
To place yourself in GDT's hands, as he tells the type of story he tells better than anyone else, is a rich pleasure.|Fresh
The bad guys are a bit cliched, but you've never seen a film with the drifty, incredibly dreamy look of this masterpiece.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is beautifully crafted on a technical level, just like del Toro's other films, but it's no more communicative than Pacific Rim. And like Crimson Peak, it renders the idea of romantic melodrama oddly abstract.|Rotten
This is a very funny premise, but from it, del Toro and co-writer Vanessa Taylor expand the film's ideas and setups, until it seems ready to burst.|Fresh
The Shape of Water makes the deepest dive into romance this year of any movie - literally, figuratively and on both sides of the camera.|Fresh
Magical, thrilling and romantic to the core, a sensual and fantastical fairy tale with moral overtones, it's a film that plays by all the rules and none of them, going its own way with fierce abandon.|Fresh
Del Toro is an imaginative storyteller, and this is a great fairy tale -- as well as a subversive inversion of the monster movie. If you have a streak of rebellion in you, you'll love it.|Fresh
Guillermo del Toro's Cold War mashup of outsider love story and Creature from the Black Lagoon is gorgeously realized and impeccably acted but simplistically written.|Fresh
A wondrous adult fairy-tale played out with impeccable cinematic control...a magical and moving experience.|Fresh
Contrasted against the movie's three-pronged institutional threats their love story is one we're happy to root for. Up with love! Down with authoritarianism!|Fresh
As prodigious as del Toro's vision and craftsmanship are, it's Hawkins who gives palpable life to his deepest ideals, and their undertow of longing for connection, not simply as a matter of romantic love, but civic virtue.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is a heartfelt and moving mash note to outsiders, misfits, and the creatures (or so says the status quo) walking among us.|Fresh
The movie is bracketed with images of Elisa floating. By the end, the audience will feel we are floating as well.|Fresh
More than any movie in recent memory, this is one you really need to discover for yourself.|Fresh
It's a finely calibrated film, brimming with romance, excitement and humanity.|Fresh
"""The Shape of Water"" is a love story like no other, and it features one of the year's most heart-wrenching performances nestled in a supreme confabulation of cinematic craft."|Fresh
"At the start, I worried that the film might prove merely winsome, like a Maryland ""Amélie,"" but Hawkins makes it taut and fierce."|Fresh
"""The Shape of Water"" is brilliant, but sick - or maybe it's sick, but brilliant. In any case, it's something to see."|Fresh
"""The Shape of Water"" is devoted, madly, to the notion of love as a state of liquid bliss, and we see that bliss and a hundred other emotions in Hawkins' nonverbal (mostly) but endlessly expressive performance."|Fresh
Del Toro has an eye for violence, kink, and dangerous desires, but his movies usually make me wish he were more willing to exploit them. He hasn't made a movie as interesting as his interests. The Shape of Water, for all of its beauty, is no different.|Fresh
It's the actors who give Shape its shape, sculpted by del Toro's affinity for the underdog.|Fresh
Del Toro might be criticised for relying heavily on archetypes in his characterisation, but such is the nature of fairy tales, and finely detailed performances bring each one of them to life.|Fresh

Del Toro has completely outdone himself with this spectacularly beautiful and meaningful love story.|Fresh
This fertile product of del Toro's vivid imagination is a fabulous beacon of hope contrasted to the turbulent era of 1962 in world history.|Fresh
It will go down as one of the most magical fairy-tales of its generation and is so mesmerizing that Pan's Labyrinth no longer holds the title of Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece. The Shape of Water is the absolute best film of the year.|Fresh
'Shape of Water' is Del Toro's best American movie yet.|Fresh
Allegory for the politics of the modern moment careen beneath nearly every complication, and yet del Toro keeps to the business of his lovingly designed sea of surfaces and... a single, singular theme throughout: loneliness.|Fresh

It's hard to come away from this film and not believe that, in his heart, writer/director del Toro is a romantic.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is perhaps the finest film ever to be directed by Guillermo del Toro and actress Sally Hawkins delivers a top-notch performance in the Cold War-set film.|Fresh
Of all the big year-end films, Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water is the most deeply moving.|Fresh
"One could speculate that this is del Toro's origin story for ""Hellboy's"" Abe Sapien...but the film also harkens back to his love of old monster movies...distinctly del Toro, yet it also recalls the films of Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet"|Fresh
[A] labored attempt at a gentle fairy tale.|Rotten
It's beaming with life and beautiful commentary on love, ignorance and the concept of monsters.|Fresh
If this story is not enough of a spike for your imagination, try taking in the visually grandiose underwater scene between monster and damsel.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is my favorite film of 2017, genre or otherwise, and it's no secret that my deep admiration for the work of del Toro rivals the way that the maestro himself worships at the altar of movie monsters.|Fresh
A fantasy thriller for the ages!|Fresh

Anchored by a soul-stirring performance by Sally Hawkins, The Shape of Water is a rapturous, romantic allegory about otherhood set during the Cold War.|Fresh
The Shape of Water rekindles a sense of wide-eyed wonder that's all too rare in contemporary cinema. Computer imagery can create amazing sights, but only a master moviemaker (and movie lover) could have fashioned this dazzling, one-of-a-kind experience.|Fresh
Even better than its offhand wittiness, its aesthetic splendor or its shrewd social commentary, however, is its headliner.|Fresh
...Beauty and the Beast, with no need for a transformative prince.|Fresh
"... marvelously rhapsodic in ways that recall films like Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"" without ever seeming slavish."|Fresh
A sensuous film that is both a fairy tale and a socially relevant portrait of the prejudices afoot in our times.|Fresh
The Shape of Water is a good effort from Guillermo Del Toro. It's not on par with his best work, but that's a pretty high standard. He nailed the casting of Sally Hawkins.|Fresh
"Guillermo del Toro reinvents classic monster movie tropes to expose the ""great"" white privilege of America's past as the true monster."|Fresh

... Sally Hawkins gives a five-star performance as Elisa...|Fresh
... showcases the versatility of a director in top form without drowning in sanctimony or sentiment.|Fresh
del Toro uses the visual language of fantasy and sci-fi in their simplest, most familiar forms, imbuing them with his childlike sensibility that he balances in turn with his signature maturity.|Fresh
Even if you're not transported by every minute of the film's story, though, del Toro creates such a sumptuous visual world that it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen.|Fresh
Every frame is enchanting, bold in color, and flush with emotion, then made exquisite by Alexandre Desplat's Parisian-inspired score.|Fresh
Your eyes may well manufacture some saltwater of their own as the story winds on its unpredictable, ever-heart-melting path.|Fresh
There's enough dreamy beauty here to smooth out the rough edges. (Fish sex, anyone?)|Fresh
... del Toro's film is poetic, sumptuous, emotionally complex, and yet almost strikingly simple in its narrative.|Fresh
Hawkins sells it without a single line of spoken dialogue to rely upon, capturing the scope of Elisa's epic journey within from lonely despair to hope and purpose, and filling every scene she's in with the joy of loving, of feeling, for the first time.|Fresh
Del Toro's 10th feature, and approximately the 10th to have macabre, gothic themes, beautiful imagery, and a dark sense of humor.|Fresh
"""The Shape of Water"" is a flow of sumptuous images set to music, a flood tide of feelings with a mythic undertow."|Fresh
This adult fairy tale is perhaps the riskiest film of Guillermo del Toro's career, but those risks generally pay off. A visually spectacular fantasy romance.|Fresh
Nothing is out of place in The Shape of Water, especially its heart. The cast is universally flawless, as is the lavish production design of Paul. D. Austerberry and the sumptuous cinematography of Dan Laustsen.|Fresh
It builds rather than stagnates, and the sadness of its characters and the film's visuals mesh wonderfully with the heroism and uplifting spirit of the plot.|Fresh
It's both weird and wonderful.|Fresh

...the nicest way I can describe it is E.T., phone Harlequin.|Rotten
Perhaps foremost, the film plays like an ode to the black-and-white staples that helped forge del Toro's passion for movies, drawing upon those old-fashioned virtues even as the director seeks to update them with a distinctive spin.|Fresh
In a corporate-run franchise-driven industry, del Toro's movies are refreshingly personal. All of this is true of The Shape of Water, but still, something's off.|Fresh
A role-reversal monster movie with gorgeous visuals from Guillermo del Toro and a knockout performance from Hawkins.|Fresh
"""The Shape of Water"" is partly a code-scrambled fairy tale, partly a genetically modified monster movie, and altogether wonderful."|Fresh
Thus begins one of the strangest yet most beautiful courtships you will see this year, a melding of horror tale, Cold War sci-fi, and musical homage [that is] a love letter to the idea of love itself.|Fresh
The Shape of Water has been made with a level of craftsmanship that should be the envy of most filmmakers, but the impudent, unruly streak that so often gives del Toro's films their pulse has been airbrushed away.|Rotten
"""The Shape of Water"" is such a gorgeous, deeply felt movie I wish that del Toro didn't still have some of his schoolboy urge to gross us out."|Fresh
The scenes that take place in a seemingly undersea world are stunning, and del Toro's filmmaking technique buoys a love-story narrative that at times feels a little too straightforward for its unorthodox conceit.|Fresh
Guillermo del Toro makes you believe in cross-species attraction in this beautifully crafted fantasy tale of a mute cleaning woman who bonds with an exotic amphibian.|Fresh
