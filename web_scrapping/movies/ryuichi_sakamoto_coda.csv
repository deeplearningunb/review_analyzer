An intimate portrait of a man coming face to face with his mortality.|Fresh
Schible's documentary - while not particularly well shot - is a very useful insight into the work of a major composer.|Fresh
For fans who have been following his music career over the past four decades, you simply cannot pass up the opportunity to watch this as soon as you can.|Fresh
Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda is a fascinating look inside Sakamoto's process for creating art, and his humility in the face of nature's own creative process.|Fresh
Sakamoto's deep, reverential love and respect of Johann Sebastian Bach...is apparent in his own, deceptively simple, humble and soothing lines that move steadily forward to fulfilling conclusions with a similar sense of inevitably.|Fresh
"But the primary appeal of ""Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda"" comes from following this humble, quiet man as he reminisces, composes, and contemplates nature."|Fresh
Rarely does an artist profile so thoroughly embrace the style of the artist it's profiling.|Fresh
Those who are interested in how documentarians capture artistry on film will find good examples in Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda. It helps to come to the film with some foreknowledge of Sakamoto's career, however.|Fresh
Unlike most music documentaries, this one isn't so much geared for fans of the artist as it is fans of intimate character portraits.|Fresh
Despite the foreboding title, Ryuichi Coda is an often-joyous film. We share the composer's wonder as he samples raindrops in a coffee cup, a violin bow across a cymbal, or simply sitting in front of his computer, creating hair-raising washes of sound.|Fresh

Coda is such a richly rewarding experience, and one that moves so gracefully to its own intimate rhythms like fluttering notes on a page.|Fresh
There are few things more compelling than watching an artist trying to coax something out of himself and into the world before he leaves it.|Fresh
Schible allows Sakamoto, a charismatic, charming presence, to gently thrill as he quests for, then discovers a sound, living eternally, entirely in the instant we are witnessing. The keyboard lives.|Fresh
[An] intimate, emotional, and surprisingly small-scaled profile.|Fresh
Sakamoto is fascinating to watch. He's a charming, lively presence, and it's always a pleasure to watch his expressions of delight and surprise at the new sounds he's discovering, his own or nature's.|Fresh
By the end of this documentary, you will feel as if you not only understand Mr. Sakamoto intellectually, but also share a sense of the excitement he feels when discovering just the right match of sounds.|Fresh
The documentary...is never busy, never intrusive, and glides along at a delicate pace, occasionally capturing painful footage of Sakamoto forcing down a seemingly endless sequence of anti-cancer pills, but otherwise calm, respectful and thoughtful.|Fresh
Reality and cinema combine seamlessly as editor Hisayo Kushida transitions from studio recordings to film clips that outline an eclectic career.|Fresh
[Sakamoto] is also ceaselessly interested in the possibilities of electronic music, though I have to say shots of him at the piano keyboard are more interesting than him at the computer keyboard.|Fresh
The result is an inspirational and deeply moving biopic that resonates long after the closing credits roll, not only because of the uncertain health of its subject, but the tragedies and joys of the human condition that give meaning to his work.|Fresh
Philosophical insights as well as footage of Sakamoto's far-flung field-recording trips, his love for Andrei Tarkovsky's work, and him scoring films for impulsive directors reveal an ingenious musician still questing for new ideas.|Fresh
Though all-too-imperfectly shot ... this portrait of a towering titan of the music world still inspires, informs and entertains in equal measure.|Fresh
Though all-too-imperfectly shot (a source of both its charms and its flaws), filled with too many jittery, off-kilter close-ups for my taste, Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda has one major thing going for it, and that is the quiet charisma of its titular subject.|Fresh
Like Sakamoto himself, the documentary stretches boundaries, shifting forward and back through time, weaving archival clips and news footage with scenes of Sakamoto composing, rehearsing, experimenting and traveling.|Fresh
Death and disaster are running themes in Coda, but Sakamoto's musical responses to these crises will be his legacy.|Fresh
It too often relies on lazy synchronicity, drawing awkward parallels between Sakamoto and the films he's worked on.|Rotten
Above it all is a resignation towards its own ephemeralness.|Fresh
Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda serves as a respectful and sincere portrait of this provocative yet tender artist, who remains as experimental and innovative as ever.|Fresh
With a light touch but deep reserves of respect for fans both old and new Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda is an extremely fitting portrait of the influential composer.|Fresh
By showing the different sides of Sakamoto, Schible enables the viewer to see how they influence this personal album.|Fresh
This is a documentary that rejects every behind-the-scenes clich√© around, and stands as an immensely moving and inspiring piece of cinema in its own right.|Fresh
A gentle, reflective portrait that seldom gets personal and yet somehow feels quite candid.|Fresh
