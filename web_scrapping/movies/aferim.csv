A boisterous black-and-white Romanian faux-western should not, by rights, be this funny, this jaw-droppingly well photographed, or this incisive in its depiction of society and history.|Fresh
A twisted history lesson whose messages transcend its insular time period of 19th-century Romania.|Fresh
Aferim! is a landscape film of gorgeous variety, which sends Costandin and Ionita riding through mountains, fields, and forests, and a folkloric romp of increasingly grisly tone.|Fresh
So intricately textured, well observed and meticulously researched are the incidents these two encounter... that the film seems to combine the best pleasures of historical romp, road movie and western.|Fresh
Everybody in Aferim! seems to hate and demean everyone else. And yet, they all seem like parts of the same blend of cultures - not a melting pot, but sort of a stew - that reasserts itself throughout the film.|Fresh
The antithesis of warm and reassuring, hard to snuggle up to, but impossible to take our eyes off of.|Fresh
Both a stark, widescreen black-and-white Western and a deadpan Romanian dramedy in the manner of 'The Death of Mr. Lazarescu' and the recently released 'The Treasure.'|Fresh
Aferim! never tries to foreground its own significance and is ultimately much more affecting.|Fresh
Jude gets strong performances from his three leads and, with the help of cinematographer Marius Panduru, has created an uncommonly beautiful film ... that at times evokes the simple beauties of classic Westerns.|Fresh
In subject and style, it's a departure from [Jude's] contemporary satires, but the period story is evidence of the same keen eye for class hierarchy, codified cruelty and the limits of self-deception.|Fresh

Like many films set in contemporary Bucharest, this is a story of self-styled potentates, small-time graft, and inevitable disappointment.|Fresh
Violent, profane, and frequently hilarious.|Fresh
A funny and brutal costume drama with a potent contemporary kick.|Fresh
Shot in widescreen black-and-white on 35mm, the film combines the structure of a classic Western with the look of Eastern European films from the 1960s, to reasonably absorbing effect.|Fresh
The laughs come from our disorientation at witnessing a world that is insanely peculiar, so different from ours in its understanding of right and wrong that we sit in amazement.|Fresh
Lyrical and nightmarish in turns, but in no way nostalgic, Jude's reconstruction of this world makes for one of the most striking films of the last year, and a flamboyant anomaly in today's often cautious world of European art cinema.|Fresh
Its spotlight on racial prejudice has resonance given the current refugee crisis, as does its jaded attitude toward any political or economic change.|Fresh
Aferim! plays like a sleight of hand, amusing us at a distance with vulgarisms and entrancing us with countryside while the bloody work of civilization grinds on out of the corner of our eye.|Fresh
"""Aferim!"" may be set in the 19th century, but this Romanian drama couldn't be more contemporary in its themes. Bigotry and fear grip the characters in ways that will be uncomfortably familiar to modern eyes."|Fresh
The crisp black-and-white photography and brisk panning shots across alluring landscapes capture the cruelty of the times and the pitiless course of history with a bitter majesty.|Fresh
Despite subject matter that involves slavery, torture, and relentless bigotry, the film is wildly, bitterly funny.|Fresh
Like the USA, Romania is haunted by the slavery of the 19th century. The Roma, like the Africans, were less than human in the eyes of those above them, even when they too were seen as dirt by the ruling classes.|Fresh
Radu Jude's Aferim! isn't interested in the complexities and nuances of morality. His is a film of people-some are good, some are bad, most are both...|Fresh
Radu Jude's most accomplished and original feature yet.|Fresh
The film's black humor is inextricably tied to serious questions about moral relativism and personal responsibility.|Fresh
Through keeping the camera mostly at a distance, with the viewer observing and hearing rather being fed emotional cues, Radu invites an intellectual judgment.|Fresh
You get to say, truthfully, that you've seen a black and white, period Romanian art-house movie that intelligently dissects and contextualizes the historical roots of racism, and no one need ever know you've just had a blast.|Fresh
"The title translates as ""Bravo!"", and the irony runs thick through the film."|Fresh
A harsh history lesson leavened by bawdy humor and classic western elements.|Fresh
The movie foregrounds the ugly sentiments of the feudal era that define its quest-driven characters while steadily humanizing them.|Fresh
