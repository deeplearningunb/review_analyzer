Southside With You is a rare love story. One that doesn't put on rose tinted glasses and magic moments. Instead, the film focuses on real, obtainable love.|Fresh
It's sweet and honest in its simplicity, and despite an ultra-low budget that can barely mask that the events aren't actually taking place in the late 80s, Tanne still manages something softly entrancing.|Fresh

Southside With You is a lovely notion, a celebratory biography, and a slightly presumptuous memorial all wrapped up in a dreamy romantic date movie.|Fresh
Southside With You doesn't need to preach, shout or wave its racial bona fides like a battle-worn banner. Instead, it embraces us, conspiratorially acknowledging a shared understanding that change requires fighting for hope and love in every moment.|Fresh

Writer/director Richard Tanne's Southside with You manages a delicate and thrilling balancing act.|Fresh
Southside with You, while sweet and overly schmaltzy at times, powerfully reminds viewers that the story the Obamas gave us over the past eight years is one worth holding onto and retelling for future generations.|Fresh
The movie puts Michelle - an independent, empowered, black woman - up on a pedestal, which seems natural until you remember how rarely movies do this.|Fresh
Sumpter and Sawyers have beautifully captured all the smallest details about the larger than life, real-life characters they portray.|Fresh
There is simplicity and verisimilitude, even emotion and suspense, in the development of the plot but its incompleteness takes away much of the repercussion to which it aspires. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Even though the audience knows how this story ends up, the film does little to shed light on how it truthfully started.|Rotten
The film focuses on real, obtainable love. It's the kind of love that inspires you to be better.|Fresh
They end up seeing Spike Lee's revelatory Do the Right Thing, and the history in moments such as that give weight to Richard Tanne's sweet, sturdy romantic drama|Fresh
An ordinary story, told with realism and sobriety that are unusual in American cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A charming film, with dialogues and convincing situations and with two protagonists who know how to convey the feelings of the beginning in a love story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of those selective biopics, bathed in African American culture and that can be read just like a romantic comedy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Southside With You is a hagiography tormented by the truth.|Rotten
With a pair of great performances and a fascinating premise, Southside with You is a leisurely-paced, but intriguing, look at a piece of romantic history.|Fresh
The duo make for good company but the courtship can only just sustain the weight of history.|Fresh
Works best as both a combined character study and a snapshot of issues that remain all too relevant.|Fresh
The film turns a potentially grating one-trick pony into a fascinating snapshot of America, the black experience and two future leaders in the throes of some kind of awakening.|Fresh
...super likable, charming and romantic...|Fresh
[Southside With You] puts on a screen, for everyone to see, a romantic courtship between educated African Americans, the kind that Hollywood rarely depicts.|Fresh
A truly horrible TV movie premise -- let's re-create the first romantic date between Barack and Michelle Obama -- is given serious intellectual and emotional heft in the writer-director Richard Tanne's feature debut|Fresh
Decent performances notwithstanding, there's a cloying quality to some of the scenes that turns the romance of the president and his first lady into something akin to a magazine photo story.|Rotten
The film itself is relatively slight, but it's warm, engaging and likeable. In fact, it's a perfect choice for a first date.|Fresh
As a multi-faceted character study - of a couple, a nation, a racial identity - there are surprises around every corner.|Fresh
A gently likable, Linklaterish movie that ideologically conflates romantic excitement with progressive idealism, bringing in some unexpected subtleties.|Fresh
Even if you didn't know what comes next, this story of the first days of the Obamas would still seduce as a sweet, smart romance.|Fresh
Viewers get the sense of the couple as two intelligent, idealistic people simply getting to know each other, and they are admirably fleshed out by the actors.|Fresh
First-time filmmaker Richard Tanne conjures an effective sense of time and place -- Chicago, 1989 -- and the leads are a real find, radiating authority, charm and chemistry.|Fresh
A charming, cute, partially fictionalized dramatization of the Obamas' first date- but the film's centerpiece scene fails (Splice Today)|Fresh
Stumbles occasionally, but still manages to cast a hushed spell that never entirely fades.|Fresh
It's of great commendation to all involved that we're dealing with a film presented as a 'will they-won't they' where you know fully well they will, and yet it matters little.|Fresh
"Southside With You transcends ""date"" film terrain to a nuanced character study of the onset of the United States' future presidential family."|Fresh
"They attend 'Do the Right Thing,' and Spike Lee's provocative movie mirrors, in expressionistic fashion, the hours-long debate over racial identity, social responsibility and ""Afrocentric"" art that runs through Barack and Michelle's day together."|Fresh
"A tremendous walk-and-talk romance that would work just fine devoid of context. But it's that context that puts it over the top - into ""best of the year"" territory."|Fresh
In the closing months of their terms, Bush got a 'Nixon,' and Obama got a 'Before Sunrise.'|Fresh
Hagiographic retelling of Obama's first date likely to disappoint those uninitiated into his cult of personality.|Rotten
In our present climate, it's as welcome as a scoop of ice cream on a hot summer day.|Fresh
Southside With You isn't just a crystal ball look at history in the making. It's fun to peek into the past and figure out how Barack and Michelle became who they are today, but these characters also exude a timeless, universal appeal.|Fresh
Tanne focuses on showing who they are, not telling us through wordy dialogue. By filling in the blanks with the political landscape, the scope of this one date night broadens to capture the spirit of Chicago in the summer of 1989.|Fresh
Though often charming and clearly well-intentioned, it feels a bit awkward.|Fresh
Southside With You is a sweet date movie that serves as an unexpected respite from the current firestorm of political absurdity.|Fresh
Writer-director Richard Tanne, at times, creates banter between the pair worthy of a Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn exchange.|Fresh
Tanne's on-screen myth-making is a bland cocktail of race, class, and super-chaste sexuality, going so far past Authorized Flattery that it resembles a hustle.|Rotten
"If you can set politics aside for 80 delightful minutes, even the staunchest Republicans will swoon over ""Southside with You."""|Fresh
Southside with You is unmistakably worthy of a second date.|Fresh
A socially charged and robustly intellectual love story, but a love story nonetheless.|Fresh
A sweet and minor bit of hagiography ...|Fresh
Sawyers is uncannily good as Obama while avoiding plain mimicry. He's the proverbial young man in a hurry, only too cool to let you see him sprint. Sumpter has the trickier, tougher role (the first lady probably knows the feeling).|Fresh
People need to see Southside with You. It's a wonderful romance. Wistful, ebullient, full of energy and life, Tanne's movie crosses races and political boundaries.|Fresh
The joy in experiencing the movie is simply watching two people getting to know each other, with all of the awkward moments, little sparks and such that occur on first dates. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Southside With You is quietly romantic, but more than that, it burns with a deep sense of optimism.|Fresh
Southside with You stumbles like so many could-be great biopics, by being overly reverential to its subjects.|Fresh
Subtly sweet, a heartfelt date movie - aimed specifically at an audience that relishes fictionalized famous romances, like Jacqueline Bouvier/John Kennedy & Prince Charles/Diana Spencer.|Fresh
Southside With You, while sweet and never less than reverent with its subjects, is hardly one of the great on-screen romances. It's also remarkably devoid of tension.|Rotten
Southside gives us the background and back stories of this bright, attractive, ambitious couple.|Fresh
... scores by keeping its focus simple and its ambitions modest.|Fresh
Southside With You is more than a carefree portrait of young love, but how much more may depend on your ability to keep your political perspectives at arm's length.|Fresh
Though it's barely 84 minutes long, this buoyant yet reflective movie captures the ever-shifting mood of a daylong encounter that changed both its protagonists' lives.|Fresh
Witty, winning, but sometimes long-winded tale of love.|Fresh
A surprisingly delightful little treat.|Fresh
One of the surprising strengths of writer-director Richard Tanne's delightful film is that it doesn't rely on our knowledge that, someday, these two twenty-somethings we're watching will become president and first lady.|Fresh
It's breezy and cute and will do absolutely nothing to sway anyone's politics. Which is exactly the point.|Fresh
"""Southside With You"" plays like ""Before Sunrise"" if those two characters had a really epic epilogue."|Fresh
For a film with relatively modest intentions, Southside With You can stir up some epic and opposing waves of emotion.|Fresh
We just don't see this kind of thing here in America, but there's also never been a couple in the White House like Barack and Michelle Obama.|Fresh
It's so respectful I could barely keep my eyes open, but first-rate performances from Sumpter and Sawyers pulled me through.|Rotten
"""Southside With You"" is a terrific film - funny, romantic, respectful without being stuffy and, yes, inspiring."|Fresh
It's like an extended version of a convention video, crafted to please the faithful and maybe haul in a few uncommiteds.|Fresh
The actors prove their ability to make the jump to lead roles and Richard Tanne is off to a great start as a filmmaker of note.|Fresh
One wouldn't quite say this date movie is political, but this deeply personal portrayal of the President and First Lady is inherently political -- asserting their humanity and the specific life experiences that brought them to the White House.|Fresh
Utterly witty, charming, and captivating .|Fresh
A deceptively simple, remarkably lean, and well-paced indie pic about the young Barack Obama's first date with the young first-lady-to-be Michelle Robinson.|Fresh
...a delight from start to finish. As they begin to fall in love, so do we.|Fresh
Southside With You has a claim to relevance for anyone who was moved even a little bit by the inauguration, or, almost 20 years earlier, by Do the Right Thing.|Fresh
The point is not what they will become but ... the specific connection between these two people at this particular moment in time.|Fresh
Only a chosen few know how accurate the movie is, but to Tanne's credit, most of the effort feels like a documentary.|Fresh
The mollifying figure on display here bears little resemblance to the hyperpartisan president Obama turned out to be, but it's sweet to remember things could have been different.|Fresh
Tanne's imagining of the first couple's first date should prove both sweet and surprisingly revealing.|Fresh
[It's] breezy, warm and romantic, if ultimately somewhat slight. In other words, the complete opposite of the past eight years.|Fresh
How pleasant to watch a subtle, sweet-natured romantic tale about Barack and Michelle Obama devoid of the partisan rancor and rhetoric of the ongoing presidential campaign.|Fresh
Tanne presents a Richard Linklater-style examination of a day and evening together, where two people in their 20s - she a lawyer at a downtown firm and he a summer associate at the same shop - slowly come to know each other.|Fresh
A sweet date-night movie about a date that wasn't really a date. Until it was.|Fresh
"Unlike the vast majority of supposed love stories, ""Southside With You"" is a romance that makes it clear why the lovers are falling for each other."|Fresh
Mr. Tanne has clearly made a close study of his real-life inspirations, yet his movie is soon hostage to the couple's history. His characters feel on loan and, despite his actors, eventually make for dull company ...|Rotten
This insightfully written, tightly directed and superbly acted drama captures an adult first date's magical discoveries, growing attractions and the slowly earned melding of minds and hearts (plus the melting of ice cream later).|Fresh
As the one-day POTUS and first lady, Sawyers and Sumpter capture the familiar essence of this now well-known couple without impersonating them, imagining them with a fresh perspective about who they were long before becoming famous.|Fresh
Here's the date movie of the year, about a first 1989 date between Barack Obama (Parker Sawyers) and Michelle Robinson (Tika Sumpter). Both actors are terrific, suggesting the powerhouses they're playing without undue mimickry.|Fresh
This isn't pure hero worship, either; it's the work of a filmmaker enchanted by his subjects as a couple, not as conduits of history.|Fresh
Southside doesn't hang on epiphanies; instead, it delivers something more modest: a tender, unrushed love story.|Fresh
An irresistibly romantic and rousing success.|Fresh
First-time filmmaker Richard Tanne eschews politics and heavy foreshadowing, opting instead to craft a breezy, intimate and tender film about two people making that fateful first connection.|Fresh
It's a bit like Before Sunrise, only with the leader of the free world in the Ethan Hawke role.|Fresh
It's charming, sweet and smart, and it isn't loaded with destiny. Tanne, in his first feature, has found a way to make his point by barely making it at all.|Fresh
An awkward mix of low-key romantic drama and historical foreshadowing, with dialogue that sometimes sounds like the characters reciting their own Wikipedia entries.|Rotten
Southside With You is a small movie about a big thing -- that moment when two people realize they're going to spend the rest of their lives together.|Fresh
A delightfully low-key portrait that is as universal as it is grounded in a well-chronicled public-private life.|Fresh
Nuanced and charming, Southside With You is a sunny, strolling odyssey through African-American life in 1989, filtered through two future icons as they navigate the world around them and their place in it.|Fresh
One might question why a simple first-date story needs to involve the future president and first lady, but its near-total lack of precursors suggest that if it weren't about one of the most famous black couples, it would likely not have been made at all.|Fresh
As a work of imagination inspired by fact, the film shimmers with warmth.|Fresh
Sawyers and Sumpter ... [are] better than the writing, which follows its diagram and lays out the conflicts and personality differences very, very neatly.|Fresh
"""Southside With You"" proves once and for all that a romantic film doesn't rely on suspense. We know these people are getting together. What holds us to our seats is wondering how it will happen."|Fresh
Nicely conveys a broader, more intimate portrait of the First Couple, the movie probably would have been enriched if Tanne hadn't hemmed himself in so much with the conceit and instead traced more of the early stages of their courtship.|Fresh
An infectiously sweet, lovely tale about two young people who bring out the best and most hidden sides of each other.|Fresh
A sweet and enlightening peak into the early lives of the Obamas as director Richard Tanne takes us on their first date way back in 1989. Both stars are flawless.|Fresh
It's a sweet-natured, gentle film that might remind more than a few watchers of a special date in their own life, long ago.|Fresh
In the end, Tanne has given us a movie that is warm and watchable without overdoing it.|Fresh
Sawyers seems to have absconded with one of the real Obama's discarded cigarette butts and sucked in his Marlboro Red essence, while Sumpter gives a solid but overshadowed performance ...|Fresh
Not a film freighted with destiny, but a charming first-date romance, an affectionate farewell to a classy First Couple.|Fresh
This plausible account of the blossoming of love between Barack and Michelle serves up a pleasant, if sanitized version of their romantic launch en route to an historic rendezvous with destiny!|Fresh
It's the pleasant movie we deserve after a needlessly contentious eight years.|Fresh
The film may not announce itself as hagiography, but it's hero-worshipful to its core.|Rotten
This tender, intimate drama has the grand resonance of a historical epic.|Fresh
Of course this is a stylized -- and yes, on occasion, idealized -- version of the launching point of a lifelong romance between two young Chicago residents who would go on to make history. That's pretty much the point.|Fresh
Equally clever and charming, and ultimately a pretty good date movie in its own right.|Fresh
If you remove the historic importance of these two characters, Southside with You still mostly works as a simple love story between a pair of intellectuals striving for greatness.|Fresh
In a news cycle which can often make our leaders seem like impassive mouthpieces, Southside With You exceeds in humanizing them.|Fresh
It's a lovely film about two charismatic people walking, talking and slowing falling in love over ice cream.|Fresh
How often do we see movies where characters are given the freedom to just walk and talk?|Fresh
Airy and pleasant, a modest film that gets by on charm and aesthetics. We of course know what mighty things await these two young lovebirds, but for its brief spell, Southside With You's first blushes feel plenty big enough.|Fresh
That's what makes Southside With You work, because it just boils down to two people trying to figure out life and each other.|Fresh
A classic meet-cute with a twist.|Fresh
Southside With You is an affectionate look at two young people on their first date, unaware of what history has in store for them.|Fresh
A warm and surprisingly engaging account of the first date of Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson.|Fresh
Sumpter and newcomer Sawyers inhabit the roles of the future First Couple with easygoing charm.|Fresh
It may not offer a fresh perspective on the world's most famous couple, but effectively resurrects their initial appeal in public life by uncovering its roots.|Fresh
On some level, this enterprise was doomed from conception.|Rotten
If you set aside the famous names and everything we know about these two characters' futures, what's left is a wonderfully crafted romance between a pair of African-American individuals, in a context rarely seen onscreen.|Fresh
"There'd be no movie here if not for who the characters are; but even if Tanne had changed their names, ""Southside With You"" will still be a charmer."|Fresh
Richard Tanne has pieced together a lovely story that rises above its novelty premise. Southside with You is a rewarding bite-sized drama, rich with characters that we already know, but also don't really know.|Fresh
It deserves success. Moreover it should make stars of Sawyers and Sumpter.|Fresh
Makes Barack a predator to begin with. He is determined to ignore her boundaries. Fortunately, I don't believe that part is true. It is dramatic license and poorly thought out fiction.|Rotten
The JFK-ing of Obama ... it *almost* vindicates itself.|Rotten
We just don't see this kind of thing here in America, but there's also never been a couple in the White House like Barack and Michelle Obama.|Fresh
"Southside With You uses our affection for the Obamas to add urgency in the otherwise simple script. We want these two to get together, and we want them to say things like: ""I just want to do more to help out."""|Fresh
Fortunately, Tanne didn't have to compromise at all with his two charismatic leads: Not only are they dead ringers for Barack and Michelle, but they go beyond impression to deliver something real and human-sized.|Fresh
A romantic, frustrated, compassionate, quietly moving film.|Fresh
Barack and Michelle's Before Sunrise-esque first date makes for a charming indie romance.|Fresh
Tika Sumpter and Parker Sawyer are terrifically cast as younger versions of Michelle and Barack Obama in Richard Tanne's disarmingly romantic walkabout.|Fresh
