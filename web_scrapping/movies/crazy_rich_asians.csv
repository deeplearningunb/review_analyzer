When she lands in Singapore, Rachel is like an innocent butterfly emerging from her American middle-class cocoon - into the awaiting mouths of snobbish, bejeweled bullfrogs.|Fresh
Those who've lamented the dearth of rom-com films over the last several years will rejoice, for Crazy Rich Asians more than compensates.|Fresh
This is a terrific little picture, one that checks all the traditional rom-com boxes.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians hits all the expected notes expertly and stuck me right in the center of my romantic comedy-loving heart square with an opulent, diamond-studded arrow.|Fresh
On top of its historical significance, Crazy Rich Asians is a great movie, period. I laughed, I cried, sometimes both at the same time. Thanks Jon M. Chu and the phenomenal cast, it's such a joyful experience that's both funny AND romantic.|Fresh
Overall it's a movie that has it all!|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is a classic romantic comedy done right...|Fresh
Sure, there are some unnecessary side characters and the wealth worship is a bit off putting, but the romance and humor are mostly on point, and the cultural nuance and themes are crazy good.|Fresh
The wholehearted embrace of cultures is not the only reason why the film works. It succeeds just as much as a celebration of that as it does in returning the romantic-comedy back to its rightful crowning place, as a genre that can surprise and delight.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is a great romantic comedy that happened to star all Asians. This movie is great if you're Asian. This movie is also great if you're not!|Fresh

Crazy Rich Asians is a great romantic comedy that happened to star all Asians. This movie is great if you're Asian. This movie is also great if you're not!|Fresh
Flawed, yet still easily the biggest, best, and most memorable romcom in years. A single viewing won't suffice.|Fresh
While Crazy Rich Asians might be mired in melodrama and unoriginal story lines, it's not a bad movie.|Fresh
This somewhat cheesy crowd-pleaser offers a great deal of neurotic gossip addressed with annoying pomposity and superfluous multi-cultural fashion.|Rotten
A sumptuous visual feast.|Fresh
[Crazy Rich Asians is] bursting with culture, glamour, color, humor and heart.|Fresh
Apart from the representation-argument, the film itself was... average. The plot was trope-laden, the performances were average at best, and most characters were cut-outs of your usual rom-com cast.|Rotten
[Director Jon M. Chu] dares to tread where no Hollywood movie about Asia ever has.|Fresh
With great performances that made me cry a few times, a story that reaches the depths of a shark cage, and an absolutely impeccable production, you'll sure be sad to be poor.|Fresh
... funny, insightful, and psychologically astute, offering a sardonic view of life among super rich Chinese from the point of view of an outsider...|Fresh
When it comes to standard issue rom-com territory, Crazy Rich Asians nears perfection. It's impossible not to fall victim to the film's abundant charms.|Fresh
Fifty Shades of Cray.|Fresh
It may not be anything particularly new, but the movie presents well-crafted and likable characters, an enjoyable story and some good laughs to create a real feel-good time.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians looks more like a glossy tourist magazine produced for an international economics summit than a movie.|Rotten
Islands are rented out, a fairytale wedding will make for one of the most beautiful ever captured on film, and you will get lost in the beauty of Singapore.|Fresh
A sparkling and thought-provoking romcom (though as usual I wished the heroine ditched him). Ultimately this is about mothers doing their best for their children. And as all mothers know, whatever you do it'll probably turn out to be wrong.|Fresh
The camera ogles over the dresses, the jewelry, the houses, the cars, the feasts ... with a determination to render us helpless by sheer relentlessness.|Fresh
A satirical but affectionate view of Asian culture from the inside, a genuinely serious look at the place of cultural values in marriage, and most certainly far, far more fabulous set designs than any recent film. Entertaining and fun.|Fresh
... simply a great time at the movies built to relieve through catharsis and creature comforts alike.|Fresh
It is with great pleasure to say that Crazy Rich Asians is a load of fluffy, old-school rom-com fun, all thanks to likable leads, memorable characters, visual pizazz and some welcome thematic weight thanks to its respectful look at family traditions.|Fresh
A wholly enjoyable, delightful, and relevant rom-com that solidifies Constance Wu as an absolute star.|Fresh
Not often are the words 'rom-com' and 'spectacle' paired together. Crazy Rich Asians is an absolute must-see.|Fresh
If any Hollywood movie were so completely devoid of black, Asian or Latino characters it would be torn to shreds by the same critics that find Crazy Rich Asians refreshing and empowering.|Rotten
No matter how many jokes are made that pretend to laugh at the rich, there is a rejoicing in capitalist inequality that borders on obscenity. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten

A romantic comedy that connects with our times, but its artistic level does not transcend the generic rules and formulas. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten

One of the best times you will have in a cinema in 2018.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is a pleasant greeting card of a movie, designed to not so much impress as mollify.|Fresh
It's easy to appreciate yet another blockbuster with a cast of minority actors proving that they never had anything to prove in the first place.|Fresh
This is the accidental genius of Crazy Rich Asians; it shows how wealth, in the end, makes fools of us all.|Fresh
It seems fair to warn that the film shouldn't be seen on an empty stomach or after an itinerary-less month.|Fresh
I would watch a phone book if it were played by Awkwafina. She's a delight.|Fresh
It's lively and colorful, fun but significant; there's a little bit of everything here for everyone to enjoy.|Fresh
The best studio romantic comedy of the year|Fresh
Jon M. Chu's Crazy Rich Asians, the film, is sufficiently unastonishing; a meandering though nevertheless engrossing romantic comedy|Rotten
If you are tired of watching all those Disney princess movies coming out of Hollywood, then give this one a chance, just to see it done with an all-Asian cast.|Fresh
"Watching its characters, Steve Rogers' quip instantly comes to mind: ""Take away the money, what are you?"" Unfortunately for Crazy Rich Asians, it has neither the wit nor the likability of Tony Stark. Instead, it drawls like Bruce Wayne, ""I'm rich."""|Fresh
'Crazy Rich Asians' is a wealth of fun.|Fresh
A romantic comedy that manages to escape some of the genre's cliches, moving away from its potentially soap-operaish roots. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Despite Wu's sympathetic performance as an independent woman willing to sacrifice her own happiness, in the end it's still all about getting the guy.|Rotten
The razzle dazzle is eye popping, and after a while a bit wearing, as money appears to be the raison d'etre of the entire Singapore crew.|Fresh
...a delightful romantic comedy trapped within the confines of a bloated, hit-and-miss prestige production.|Fresh
A binge-able series might have been a better way to go, since the script squeezes a sprawling supporting cast into boisterous caricatures and transforms an intricate flow chart of status among Singapore's superrich into a flood of affectations.|Rotten
What I like most about Crazy Rich Asians is the way it combines the old and the new.|Fresh
Glimmers with emotion, exuberance and cultural specificity, engagingly and enjoyably so.|Fresh
The strong point of the film is the fascination of having an ordinary story in an extraordinary environment, always bearing in mind that it is an American production betting on something different, for a change. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Aside from these important issues of representation and diversity, Crazy Rich Asians marks a welcome return for the funny, giddy, likeable, glamorous Hollywood romcom.|Fresh
We want to see Rachel win [Eleanor] respect: Crouching Matriarch, Hidden Dragon. Hollywood, prepare to be beaten at more than mah jong.|Fresh
First impressions were that it's noisy, shouty and just not funny enough.|Rotten
A comedy with brains and glamour, Crazy Rich Asians arrives in cinemas long after most of us had given up hope of ever seeing a really great romcom again.|Fresh
It is the sweet and funny journey with its issues around wealth and family honour versus personal happiness and to an extent, nationality after immigration, that give the film a certain newness.|Fresh
Deeply satisfying in the way of a by-the-books romantic comedy that has found good character-based reasons for checking all of the boxes that need to be checked.|Fresh
Somewhere between My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a Jane Austen novel: meticulous and hilariously alert to social structures, family dynamics and money, with a plucky underdog heroine.|Fresh
Michelle Yeoh takes the acting honours as the heroine's steely prospective mother-in-law.|Fresh
Michelle Yoh is terrific not least because... you have [her] character who is very not funny in a way which is kind of impressive in a comedy.|Fresh
A culturally complex, swoon-worthy rom-com.|Fresh
In many ways, this supposed celebration of diversity disappoints. It doesn't matter. Its unpredictable female leads are as good as gold.|Fresh
Though undeniably sweet and funny in parts, I thought it mostly vacuous, lazily- plotted nonsense.|Rotten
Chu's film brings the wealth porn of Dallas and Dynasty back with a bang.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians has done the impossible - created a romantic comedy not only funny and dazzling but politically relevant too, without betraying its genre-bound duty to warm the heart.|Fresh
Watch this film, fall in love - and buy a handful of scratch cards on the way home.|Fresh
The director, Jon M Chu, thankfully, knows his rom-coms. There's Pretty Woman in here. There's Bridget Jones and Ever After, but he's made them new.|Fresh
And what it's doing right is showing white people that they don't own Hollywood any more, and maybe everyone wants to applaud that. In this way, it's a terrific film.|Fresh
[A] good-natured and spectacular comedy...|Fresh
Director Jon M. Chu keeps the plot racing along as Rachel is introduced to a small army of her boyfriend's relatives and friends.|Fresh
The whole film has an idiotic élan. It's a Jane Austen story done as razzmatazz romcom, plus a bit of all-singing, all-dancing Rebecca.|Fresh
It was refreshing to see a story that isn't the stereotypical story...we've heard it before and seen it in many different ways, but this one felt authentic.|Fresh
A beautiful cast, a great sense of humor, although I do have a bone to pick with this movie (and Black Panther) as the baton for people of color in films...|Fresh
Above all, it's got that romcom magic. Like any of the best real-life weddings, it makes you simultaneously laugh and cry and go 'awww!' in the kissy bits. Suffering from post-summer holiday blues? Consider them banished.|Fresh
It deserves all the kudos it can get for its representation of Asian people (but) more than that it deserves to be seen because it's a fun, well-made romance.|Fresh
There isn't a dull moment, and Chu keeps the visuals colourful and almost jaw-droppingly over the top, never pausing the stream of food, flowers, dancers, glorious settings and beautiful people.|Fresh
A decadent fever dream of gorgeous people, places and things.|Fresh
Jon M. Chu's adaptation of Kevin Kwan's book stands on its own, adding key scenes, tweaking character's roles while at the same time bringing the over-the-top opulence to life|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is as much an environment as it is a romantic comedy... The movie takes you away, and much of the trip is a pleasurable experience, with dazzling visuals, a bright score coupled with insanely catchy pop tunes, and a charismatic cast.|Fresh
Lavish, lush, gaudy...but the engine of the story it's telling, that works very well. Everything else is just padding...it's telling a more specific tale.|Fresh
For the most part, Crazy Rich Asians feels appealingly sincere, even if its obsession with image somewhat contradicts the those-who-project-perfection-rarely-have-perfect-lives message.|Fresh
There aren't too many surprises in terms of story but this is still fun, engaging and entertaining.|Fresh
a film that adheres strictly to the formulas demanded while also being as thorough an indulgent delight as the over-the-top as the antics of the super-rich that it portrays.|Fresh
Delivers a classic, yet timely and passionate love story that is to be embraced not only for its spirit, but also for its rarity.|Fresh
This is a glossy, energetic romance-drama-comedy that continues the process of putting Asia in a new light.|Fresh
This earnest and heartfelt effort seems too eager to pursue mainstream conformity by emphasizing similarities rather than embracing differences.|Rotten
An opulent, juicy, splendidly silly, tears-of-joy spectacle reminiscent of the escapist fluff of 1930s Hollywood... yet also a romantic fantasy that a progressive, feminist gal can actually feel good about.|Fresh
It's a sweet movie with a sweet story.|Fresh
Gives this decades-old Hollywood blueprint a welcome, refreshing makeover.|Fresh
Buckle up son and get ready to go on a romantic adventure... because Crazy Rich Asians is an entertaining blast.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is culturally significant, but it's still about a girl falling in love with the prince.|Rotten
It might not reinvent the wheel, but if there's a more satisfying studio release this summer, I've yet to see it. So what are you waiting for? Run, don't walk.|Fresh
It's a luxury-lifestyle catalogue on a 40-foot screen. How many other movies can say that?... We go to movies for escape, and Crazy Rich Asians provides it by letting viewers revel in limitless lucre guilt-free.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians brims over with charm... It's not an evenly complex portrait of wealth, but it's a film winningly possessed with heart.|Fresh
A society rom-com with all the dazzle of Sex and the City, but without the pornography of label-worship. Rather than fawning over the excess, we feel almost offended by it.|Fresh
The basic plot of this movie is conventional. Nothing unexpected happens. What makes this stand out are the characters, which although standard for a romantic comedy, are exceptionally well defined and developed.|Fresh
You can celebrate Crazy Rich Asians for many reasons, and all of them are valid - it's an unambiguously well made and well intentioned movie that does not lead the viewer into hell.|Fresh
A funny, feel good, crowd-pleasing movie [but it's] not the ground-breaker it's being made out to be. It's simply the latest logical progression in the growing prominence of Asians in Western films, something that has been evolving for more than 60 years.|Fresh
This reviewer is here to tell you the romantic dramedy's runaway success is no fluke, and more than warranted. It delivers a splendid time at the movies the likes of which is all too rare from a studio release.|Fresh
An effervescent breath of fresh cinematic air, this ridiculously entertaining film succeeds as an instant cultural touchstone and a reaffirmation of the joy of romantic comedies.|Fresh
The best romantic comedy from a big studio since Bridget Jones's Diary was released in 2001.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians was fun stuff and really surprising in how much I enjoyed it, even going in with slightly skeptical expectations.|Fresh
While Wu and Golding make for a very appealing screen couple, what really takes Crazy Rich Asians to the next level as a crowd-pleaser is how much life and laughable largesse can be detected deep into its supporting ranks.|Fresh
Glitzy detail, pleasing comedy and amiably broad performances propping up a very familiar plot line...|Fresh
Chu is resolved not just to say nothing about the grotesque behavior of the filthy rich - despite this being at the core of Crazy Rich Asians - but to condone it, celebrate it and wallow in its vacuity|Rotten
What's in a name? It should be quite obvious that such a book title is intended to be satirical. That Nick has been hiding his wealth and privileged background in order to woo Rachel tells exactly the opposite of what the book/movie title conveys.|Fresh
It's also first and foremost, a zingy, glossy entertainment that should resonate far and wide beyond its cultural specificity.|Fresh
Chu's direction displays a robust regard for the combined power of glamour and velocity.|Fresh
"At one juncture, someone actually intones ""this is like The Bachelor: Singapore"", which struck me as a telling moment of self-awareness in a film that far too often relies on empty spectacle and cliché for effect."|Rotten
It's crazy good.|Fresh
It's a boisterous ride that you'll want to jump on time and again, still chortling with each rewatch.|Fresh
...to decry it because it's just a fairy tale is to miss the point entirely.|Fresh
"Crazy Rich Asians offers a vibrant, wildly entertaining, and achingly sincere portrait of a rarely represented culture. As for that weighty proverb, Crazy Rich Asians doesn't necessarily ""move the world."" But it does nudge it in the right direction."|Fresh
As for the cast, though she doesn't make a false step, Wu is nonetheless totally wasted. So is Yeoh.|Rotten
Crazy Rich Asians presents a new conversation while also leaning on some of the clichés that have plagued the representations of Asians in film and television. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Such uniformly strong performances from so many little-seen or unknown actors is a stark reminder of the wealth of talent that is there for a slowly diversifying Hollywood to tap into.|Fresh
I've never cried at a wedding...this wedding they had in here, I couldn't help it... at least two choke-ups and a cry.|Fresh
What the leads do right is what the movie does right... this movie it gets the drama down... they really do feel like a couple that's in love and against all odds.|Fresh
A fairly-harmless, often-charming and entertaining paint-by-numbers romantic comedy...it has some good laughs along the way, and I walked out having been entertained.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is the perfect way to avoid reality, so if that sounds tempting, I suggest you avail yourself of its charms.|Fresh
[Jon Chu] really understands the tone of the film that he's making, and he really understands the visual palette that it needs and..he even elevates that.|Fresh
Even within what a lot of people view broadly as the same culture there are still cultural differences based on upbringing, based on background, and that's really where the strength in this movie really hit home.|Fresh
When the movie fully shifts from its dazzling milieu to something thornier, it finally comes alive.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is therefore less about love than understanding. And every little detail works towards exposing what that means on a small and large scale.|Fresh
This attention to the wealth of the 1% is just conspicuous consumption of another sort, and it ain't pretty or funny.|Rotten
Sure, Crazy Rich Asians doesn't capture my Asian American experience growing up in America, but it hits all the right notes.|Fresh
Charming and refreshing. Hits all the marks. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is a brilliant movie with a spectacular screenplay, amazing acting and set design that needs to be watched on the big screen. This is a must-watch film.|Fresh
The central irony in Crazy Rich Asians isn't that it's so much about Asians, it's more about crazy rich people - at which point ethnicity is really just a sub-category, an identifying accessory, a marketing niche.|Fresh
[Awkwafina] nails it...It's just a good ensemble cast. You care about these people.|Fresh
Constance Wu is a bona fide movie star ... She carries the emotional weight of the movie with sophistication and strength and vulnerability and humor.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians takes familiar tropes and revitalizes them and it's entire genre. It prospers from a great cast, amazing direction, and powerful writing|Fresh
As a stepping stone to greater things, this movie is important...and it's a great date movie.|Fresh
I was dancing, it was so much fun, and I left the theater feeling great.|Fresh
It's so vibrant...it has every rom-com trope that you miss from the 90s...|Fresh
A great movie that is so culturally significant.|Fresh
This two-hour feel good immersion will have you contemplating the next available flights, as well as who you can share this marvellous movie experience with next.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is a triumph of representation.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians uses elements of the golden age of Hollywood to tell a modern and entertaining story. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It doesn't pretend to be anything more than a lighthearted, glitzy crowd-pleaser. That's good and bad...overwrought moments are balanced with better ones, like the family dumpling-making scene where Rachel and Eleanor exchange frosty glances.|Fresh
As a romantic comedy, this film has nothing new to offer except the rise of a new comedy star, Awkwafina.|Fresh
Chu's career has been a tad uneven in the past, but he shows a sure hand here, drawing fine performance from a large ensemble - especially Wu, Golding, Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh.|Fresh
As a rom-com it falls a little short, not offering all that much 'com'. But it's romantic as hell.|Fresh
This slice of escapist entertainment is all about Rich People Problems, but looking in from the outside is just so much fun.|Fresh
The elements that create interest such as cultural differences, familial secrets and obligations, the love of a mother and her child and, of course, romance, strongly shine through.|Fresh
Storywise, it's all familiar territory, but the lead performances are charming, and the central characters are intelligent, complex people you enjoy spending time with.|Fresh
Judging by the talent on display here, Crazy Rich Asians could be a harbinger of more than the rom-com's rebirth.|Fresh
Jon M. Chu's landmark film glosses over questions of wealth and cultural identity for sake of spectacle.|Rotten
A solid, fun romantic comedy about very rich, very good-looking people whose dramas and obstacles are mostly self-inflicted.|Fresh
Constance Wu and Henry Golding are perfectly charming in this sweet romantic comedy, while Michelle Yeoh is here to remind us how amazing she has always been.|Fresh
Yes, it's a frothy, glittery rom com, but it's also a joyful, flashy, feel-good pic that takes you on a fabulous field trip you'll be gushing over for weeks.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is the rare film that shows we can have it all.|Fresh
Forget being an Asian American film or a rom-com-it's just a good film.|Fresh
This is a classic rom-com narrative that's been transported to the East, which adds its own mark to the genre's traditions.|Fresh
'Crazy Rich Asians' is a blast, and within minutes it will immerse you into its extraordinary extravagance and extraordinary talent.|Fresh
Wu and Golding make for a pleasant central couple, but it is the supporting characters that are most memorable.|Fresh
A glamorous confection of a romcom. It's basically the film equivalent of a chilled, bubbly glass of champagne on a steamy August night: a refreshing, classy party starter.|Fresh
Without lazily defaulting to formula, the film reinvigorates its genre.|Fresh
See Crazy Rich Asians . It's crazy entertaining, funny and sentimental. It stands as an important signpost marking new territory for Asian opportunities in Hollywood|Fresh
"Imagine the rowdy comedic timing of a Preston Sturges romp mixed with the subversive glamor of Ernest Lubitsch's patented ""touch."" Yet, beneath the glorious pomp and circumstance lies a very real conflict of cultural identity and family."|Fresh
It's been billed as rom-com, but Crazy Rich Asians can hold its own in the drama department.|Fresh
One of the best big studio-backed romantic comedies to come down the pike in years. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
It starts all flim-flam and multi coloured visuals, makes you smile and laugh until you're hooked and then it brings up the heavy guns of drama: broken loyalties, broken families, broken promises and broken hearts.|Fresh
The Singapore settings are eye-popping, the food looks amazing and the story is a mix of quirky, funny and romantic. You'd be crazy to miss it.|Fresh
...at once deeply formulaic and refreshingly unfamiliar.|Fresh
A dazzling, enchanting romantic comedy that shatters Asian stereotypes.|Fresh
"In Singapore, the term shiok is representative of a feeling of sheer happiness and pleasure. And I can't think of a better description for ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" the funniest, most joyous movie of the summer."|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is a romantic comedy giddy off its own supply -- the answer to the question of what a romantic comedy would look like if it were shot like an action film.|Fresh
A swooning fairy-tale romance that updates the Cinderella story to modern-day Singapore.|Fresh
Smartly funny, romantic without being cloying, and honest without resorting to manipulation.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is a rom-com that reveals the universal in the specific. The result is subtle in its message, sweet in sentiment, and swift in execution.|Fresh
Ethnicity aside, this is one of the best and most effective rom-coms in quite a while, a movie that is sure to win over the hearts and minds of any audience demographic.|Fresh
This is a straight-up jet-setting romcom, glossy, glam, very mainstream in style and tenor.|Fresh
This is all from the standard rom-com template, but the likable leads and sparky supporting cast manage to reinvigorate these old clichés.|Fresh
That status quo needs blowing up, and if Crazy Rich Asians can do that, great. For now, I'll settle for its well-heeled charms and the prospect of seeing some of these actors again in bigger roles.|Fresh
One of the great things that Crazy Rich Asians does is [show] you...the idea that Chinese people who continued to live in China or Singapore...have a very different view of Chinese people how grew up in America.|Fresh
[Awkwafina] almost steals the movie and never gives it back.|Fresh
Not only does director Jon M. Chu do a marvelous job of bringing the lavishness of Kevin Kwan's book to life but he's filled the movie with a supporting cast that's so strong any of them could star in their own movie.|Fresh
The rom-com is a dynamite showcase for cinema icon Michelle Yeoh.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians invites us to indulge in the lifestyles of the rich and semi-famous... and director Jon M. Chu does a deft job of making all that wealth look both super enticing and totally exhausting.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is an airy romcom that indulges our guilty cravings for family drama and the luxurious lifestyles of the obscenely wealthy. What's more American than that?|Fresh
"While I wish Wu's Rachel had more fire, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is frivolous fun that challenges non-Asians - white, black, Latino and Native American - to empathize with Asians and Asian-American characters."|Fresh
[Crazy Rich Asians is] also about old Chinese traditions, but more than that it is an excellent representation of contemporary China that the world has long been missing.|Fresh
In the end, though, it would all be for naught if the film didn't have heart and it does. We care deeply about these characters-and the film does, too.|Fresh
The same formula romance that has been churned out since the advent of movies. Not rich. Not crazy. Not funny when it's supposed to be and not all that dramatic.|Fresh
...a romantic comedy that breathes new life into the genre...|Fresh
"Awkwafina is great as Rachel's ""goofy best friend,"" and she almost makes viewers long for another film about her. Golding is agreeable, but one wishes he had more on his mind other than simply admiring Rachel."|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians is glorious, funny, and sexy, successfully fusing cultural specificity and crowd-pleasing romance.|Fresh
Little more than a cascade of genre clichés, lightly dusted with heavy-handed, and arguably insensitive, cultural trappings.|Rotten
Who knew the man who gave us Jem and the Holograms would be the one to save the rom-com?|Fresh
The world is on fire, enjoy this glass of champagne.|Fresh
There are meaningful observations about the ways that money warps relationships and how children struggle with their heritage. But by trying so hard to concoct a blowout party, the film exhausts and frustrates as much as it enlightens and delights.|Rotten
Marvelous reinvention of Cinderella. Constance Wu lights up the screen. Michelle Yeoh is great as evil matriarch. Scene-stealer Awkwafina slays it.|Fresh
Rom-coms are often lifestyle porn to some degree, 'Crazy Rich Asians' is just more straightforward about it. It's kitchy pop, done well.|Fresh
A beautiful, bland affair.|Rotten
Crazy Rich Asians is romantic-comedy gold that should be celebrated not only for its cast but also for its perfect execution of light, breezy escapism.|Fresh
It gets some wickedly funny jabs in at the fabulously wealthy. But it isn't mean-spirited. Rather, Crazy Rich Asians' prevailing mood is one of joyfulness. I got a contact high.|Fresh
It's the anti-Fifty Shades of Grey.|Fresh
See this movie you must. Maybe you won't fall in love, but you'll for sure want to go steady for a while - at least for the two hours you're in the theater.|Fresh
Crazy Rich Asians delivers an unabashedly glamorous love story, with a predictable but mostly satisfying narrative arc and plenty of entertaining, likable characters.|Fresh
Revels smartly in the excess of its subjects without being trite, superficial or dismissive.|Fresh
Dazzling delight that brings the romantic comedy genre roaring back to life.|Fresh
Think of it as a trip to a cinematic spa in the company of some of the world's best dressed and most attractive people.|Fresh
There's enough romance in this movie to power four weddings -- and if you can't appreciate that; well, it's your funeral.|Fresh
"Wu and Golding's chemistry translates well on the big screen and you want to root for them. Yeoh is also superb playing the ""mother-in-law from hell"". The supporting cast is equally as mesmerising and as a whole and the film does its job as a romcom."|Fresh
The film's side-trips to the ostentatious crib of Peik Lin's nouveau riche family are the best satire that Chu and the script, by Adele Lim and Peter Chiarelli, have to offer.|Fresh
A romantic comedy with a knock-out cast that shows us over-the-top glamour, money, privilege, and parties and raises thoughtful, nuanced questions.|Fresh
By burrowing into what makes this world so extraordinary-and finding what is universal along way-Chu and his terrific cast have made a romantic comedy for everyone.|Fresh
"While not nearly as scarce as an Asian-led Hollywood movie, a well-made romantic comedy is becoming very rare indeed. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" just may lead to a surge in both."|Fresh
Chu's not the most advanced filmmaker, bypassing a chance to truly rattle the world with something that remains inviting, but also emotionally penetrating and culturally incisive.|Fresh
At its core, the story's many themes - whether it's the clash of cultures, of class differences and of tradition versus modernity - are all universal.|Fresh
The first major Hollywood production in years to boast an all-Asian cast, this is precisely the movie entertainment we need at the end of summer―funny, refreshing, giddy and emotionally satisfying.|Fresh
'Crazy Rich Asians' is a groundbreaker steeped with familiarity and cliches|Rotten
It's simply great fun, a winsome romantic comedy and an occasionally over-the-top luxury fantasy that never flags.|Fresh
"""Crazy Rich Asians"" isn't just a good Hollywood movie for the Asian American population, and one that is overdue by about 24 years. It's a good movie, period."|Fresh
Like the great romantic comedies, it's made with a great deal of visible affection both in front of and behind the camera.|Fresh
It's great that commercial films are being made to appeal directly to groups that have previously been relegated to Hollywood's sidelines, but I can't get excited that they're being marketed the same generic crap as the rest of us.|Rotten
Chu and his writers find a delicate cultural balance that makes his characters universally familiar without forsaking Asian aspects of the story.|Fresh
