The discouraging reality regarding Trey Edward Shults' It Comes at Night is that it happens to suggest everything but means, ultimately, nothing.|Rotten
With wonderful performances, jarring music, nightmarish visuals, and devastating thematic exploration, Shults is confident in his ability to rattle you and disinterested in coddling his audience.|Fresh
It Comes at Night combines the post-apocalyptic interpersonal conflict of the late George Romero with haunting imagery and an unrelenting sense of fear.|Fresh
This is about as bleak as these things get.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is a film that is impossible to peg into one genre, and that is what makes it so effective... If you are willing to go with it, and allow the story to draw you in, Night should satisfy fans of the horror/suspense genre.|Fresh
There's no boogeyman. There's no hope for a cure. There's just the dread of losing someone you love, and that's a terror that is universal.|Fresh
When the most terrifying aspect of your horror film is the soundtrack and the most fully sympathetic character is the family dog, perhaps its time to re-examine your work.|Rotten
A realistic apocalypse where the deadlier things are what one can touch and be exposed to everyday. In the case of It Comes at Night, it is the reflection of oneself.|Fresh

It Comes at Night had the potential to grow into something special. Instead, we are left underwhelmed as we await its inevitable arrival. One which, sadly, never comes.|Rotten
More originality, or at least a better navigation of these well-worn tropes, would have improved this immensely.|Rotten
Engagingly unsettling with a lot of thrilling psychological elements|Fresh
Viewers seeking a character-driven end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it tale should be pleased.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is a powerful, slow-burning horror, a distressing and nihilistic examination of human nature that lingers in the mind long after the shocking denouement.|Fresh
On paper this sounds like a fresh exploration of the thriller genre, but It Comes at Night wears its tragedy far too proudly.|Rotten
It Comes at Night is one of the rare horror films that feature strong characters making smart decisions.|Fresh
...a horror experience that's mature, dark, and disturbing to the bone. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It Comes at Night is an engrossing and devastating movie on its own merits, but if you're expecting eviscerations, you'll be sitting disappointed in your seat long after the lights come up.|Fresh
It Comes at Night builds, and builds, and builds before unleashing a nightmarish, soul-sickening conclusion that will utterly devastate you if you've grown invested in the film's narrative.|Fresh
While the film is undeniably well-made, its outlook is so dark it crosses the line into making viewers feel more miserable than enlightened or entertained.|Rotten
The pacing and lack of gore/information might not play well with a mainstream crowd, but Shults's drawing out of tension without relying on clichés makes for a fascinating (and sweaty) watch.|Fresh
If you're tired of formulaic horror that leaves little to the imagination, It Comes at Night is the perfect remedy.|Fresh
The ending isn't wholly satisfying, but the film takes a pleasantly unsettling journey to get there.|Fresh
The film's crawling pace will no doubt alienate audiences looking for immediate thrills, but title is far from deceptive: the monsters are all there, only they are dressed in civilian clothing.|Fresh
It subverts just about every cliché you can think of as far as apocalyptic scenarios go, ignoring monsters and demons entirely to focus on the human mind, making bold statements regarding fear, paranoia, love, and family|Fresh
At its simplest form, this is highfalutin hokum.|Rotten
A quietly chilling nightmare of human frailty and strength, tense with a nameless disquietude. A supremely accomplished little film.|Fresh
The film's taut, insightful arc is a reminder of the lost power of restraint.|Fresh
... a minimalist and deeply suggestive film that uses elements of horror to establish a poignant apocalyptic metaphor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It Comes at Night demands that its audience's work with it and the end result, whilst not always entirely satisfactory, is never less than compelling and highly watchable.|Fresh
The film is still commanding and distinctive, regardless of its flaws, with the young director - who is still working his way up the industry ladder - showing great potential and a directing career worth keeping an eye on.|Fresh
This is no siege thriller and the zombies aren't scratching to get in. The drama and conflict arises from the nuances of family dynamics and strangers getting to know each other under extreme circumstances.|Fresh
This is the sort of stylish, low-budget offering that can kick-start a film-making career, but while its cast ratchet up the tension, the over-use of nightmares and some obvious plot holes may frustrate commercial audiences.|Fresh
But too often in It Comes at Night, no genuine shocks or cathartic release wait at the end of each taut thread. Instead, it's just deeper and deeper mystery.|Rotten
A thriller that moves away from the conventions of the genre in which the threads of paranoia move with solvency and dexterity. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Works almost entirely through ellipsis and withholding.|Fresh
If there's real horror here, it has less to do with jolts and gore than with the realization that under extreme conditions, mistrust can become an essential, if double-edged, survival tool. That's a truly scary idea.|Fresh
It Comes at Night balances on the knife edge between hope and despair, counterweighting the dire nature of its world with genuinely moving moments of warmth.|Fresh
The movie has its flaws. But one of Shults's main triumphs is to get us to believe in the danger of the outside world as fiercely as his characters do.|Fresh
When It Comes At Night came to an end, the entire audience collectively released the breath we'd all been inadvertently holding.|Fresh
Recommended for those who like psychological horror and stories of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The intimate film gets under the skin by examining paranoia, trust and fear of the unknown.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is a serious affair, well constructed and performed, and certainly effective.|Fresh
Shults's adoption of a more vicious mode sharpens his already discomfiting take on families in states of extreme duress in his debut feature Krisha.|Fresh
This isn't so much a horror film about monsters as it is a psychological thriller about isolation, the choices made for survival, and the struggle to remain rational against an unseen, enigmatic force.|Fresh
Shults has crafted a beautifully intelligent psychological thriller, where the most monstrous and horrific thing is ourselves.|Fresh
Edgerton, Drew Daniels's cinematography and Brian McOmber's score are leading lights in Trey Edward Shults's film. There is a slight sense of unfinished business about it all that leaves you wanting more, however,|Fresh
It's a simple exercise in terror that avoids too much explicit violence, and a quietly impressive little movie.|Fresh
It Comes At Night marks writer-director Trey Edward Shults as a talent to watch.|Fresh
The low-key, even uncannily quiet mood is also seriously unsettling, and makes sure that this lingers long after the final curtain and, just perhaps, sneaks into your mind late at night.|Fresh
With claustrophobic cinematography and an ominous score, It Comes at Night seethes with intimacy - not of the warm and friendly variety, but foreboding, unnerving and ruthless.|Fresh
The characters' behaviour rings true, the tension is strong and the oily darkness of it all looks good.|Fresh
The characters' behaviour rings true, the tension is strong and the oily darkness of it all looks good. Within his vaguely realistic constraints, however, Shults doesn't find a way to nudge the story to a satisfying ending.|Fresh
"The ""It"" of the title refers to the contagious disease that has devastated the outside world (a world that, like much in this beautifully minimalist film, we never see), but it also denotes something even more virulent and destructive: human fear."|Fresh
"Shults wants to ask his viewers, ""How far would you go to protect the people you love?"" But his work is so clinical and devoid of revelation that it's neither persuasive nor involving."|Rotten
Comes at Night will not be perfect, but you can't deny the great talent of this director who with just two films in his filmography, promises to be a force to be taken into account. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Shults's chiller delivers jolts and jitters rather than splatter and critters. Indeed, this is the sort of horror film in which man's inner demons are just as terrifying as anything lurking in the darkness outside.|Fresh
This is a stylish film that is constantly asking us questions. Sadly, answers are infuriatingly thin on the ground.|Rotten
It's a grim vision of a world losing track of objective facts, descending into a poisonous abyss of chaos and disorder. No wonder it strikes such a contemporary chord.|Fresh
This sharply original horror film not only approaches its premise from an unexpected angle, but it creates characters who add a psychological depth that makes the film far more involving than expected.|Fresh
The film's wilful ambiguity will doubtless prove frustrating for many, but this is a truly nightmarish tale, as real people in a terrible situation make snap decisions that lead to devastating consequences. It's gripping, terrifying, and heartbreaking.|Fresh
The film feels more like an indie art film than a generic shocker.|Fresh
It's not exactly scary but it made me so tense I could hardly breathe, let alone think.|Fresh
An eerie tale that is all the more effective for its restraint.|Fresh
The performances are all strong, but how anyone can say this doesn't bolt headlong into all the usual horror clichés, I don't know.|Rotten
One thing's for sure: loving thy neighbour will be a darned sight harder after this.|Fresh
A treat to ponder and deconstruct. Sombre nocturnes are rarely so entertaining.|Fresh
This is a dark and upsetting horror, with zero gimmicks but plenty of unease to leave you thinking about its final scenes for a long while.|Fresh
Full of character-based suspense, it's dramatic and ramped-up with tension.|Fresh
Think of Shults's film ... as the end of the world by lantern light: intimate and flickering up close, with unfathomable blackness beyond.|Fresh
The film is at its best in querulous, nervy scenes of cabined panic as the unknown lays shadowy siege.|Fresh
This is certainly a bleak story but it's also a rich and very nuanced one.|Fresh
Expertly crafted - astonishingly so, at times - and precisely, punishingly performed, It Comes at Night is a highly effective exercise in the controlled release of raw, relentless dread.|Fresh
A post-apocalyptic survival drama that is claustrophobic, chilling and unbearably tense.|Fresh
An intensely personal, extremely precise meditation on fear, grief, family and community ... challenging stuff that bears intellectual rigour, or, to put it another way: if you're not willing to think about it, you probably won't like it.|Fresh
It has this exploratory character that Shults showed in his first film, although, perhaps, the relationship with the background, with what he narrates, doesn't end with total cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is a fiercely watchable film.|Fresh
Rather disappointing in the end, but Shults delivers a few memorable scares.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is a masterclass in suspense building, it's a film all about the notion of trust, and is so intense, and uncompromising with it.|Fresh
It Comes At Night is a slow-burn family drama with thriller moments and a tone more in keeping with apocalyptic feel-bad flick, The Road.|Fresh
That's part of the power conveyed by the sparse storytelling - it keeps bringing connections and realisations to the surface. Little is said, but much becomes apparent.|Fresh
Shults clutches nerves deftly. Until the horror ends being a excuse to clog and it exposes that the tension between the characters doesn't worry as much as the outer threat. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It Comes at Night answers the cinematic question: Do movies even need an ending? (Yes.)|Rotten
This post-apocalyptic and claustrophobic story is full of suspense and psychological horror. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An uncompromisingly bleak slow burn, it leaves the pulse frantic and nerves frayed.|Fresh
A deeply personal exploration of the extremes of human behaviour, with a lean, real-world sensibility that makes it easy to empathise with the notion of survival at any cost.|Fresh
The film is far from being a breakthrough work within the horror arthouse, but reminds us that showing less often means getting more. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Edward Shults's work plays with a slow cinema, in which dream sequences flirt with the reality of a family in danger. However, the end of the film leaves us with much more doubts than answers. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is a well crafted film, but I am also saying this is definitely not my cup of tea, and I will never, ever subject myself to watching it again. This film rates a B, mainly for horror fans.|Fresh
The tension the movie generates is incredible and it explodes in moments that will linger in your mind for a long time.|Fresh
Mines the same dour forebodings as Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' ... a grim little cautionary fable that relies on mood, character development and performance, not 'Walking Dead' gore effects.|Fresh
Within that loose framework, a powerful tragedy centered around human nature unfolds, and it's terrifying.|Fresh
A progressively engrossing horror effort...|Fresh
It makes the audience leave the theater in angst. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
An icky, post-apocalyptic wallow that relies on gut-churning dread instead of traditional jump-scares. I hated it so much I didn't want to talk to anybody afterward and went for a long walk by myself.|Rotten
It might be a dirge of a film, but it's a beautiful, textured dirge that hangs in the air long after its last note has been played.|Fresh
Shults does a masterful job of creating a sense of place, the home suffused mostly with darkness and suggestive shadows, while his ability to push a scene from normality to unbearable tension is exceptional.|Fresh
It Comes at Night may well be the most minimalist horror movie ever made... an exceptionally tight, sly and, yes, heavy exercise in psychological suspense.|Fresh
Much is what Shults does is admirable, from his refusal to offer only the barest of exposition to his camera-work, in which he haunts the house's hallways, making it feel near-claustrophobic. What's lacking is a larger sense of purpose.|Fresh
If Krisha was a drama that eventually generated the aura of a horror film, the reverse could be said for It Comes at Night, an artful effort in genre-ambiguity that keeps Shults in the category of filmmakers to watch.|Fresh
It Comes At Night is a well-crafted examination of the human condition.|Fresh
It's chilling in its implications. Were it as chilling an experience, this would be a truly great horror film.|Fresh
It's beautiful and harrowing, and undoubtedly an accomplishment, but it ultimately feels like Shults can't decide what he wants to say.|Fresh
Trey Edward Shults. Make sure you remember that name. Burn it into your brain. It Comes at Night solidifies what a major talent he is.|Fresh
a penetrating exercise in escalating dread and despair|Fresh
A small-scaled picture that builds a striking degree of tension through very economical means, a cousin of Eli Roth's 'Cabin Fever' that depends on atmosphere rather than gore for its effect.|Fresh
It's the clear and defiant disregard for modern horror tropes that makes It Comes at Night such a refreshing watch.|Fresh
Will you be scared? Not really, but you will be made to squirm; not to mention forced to quell that uneasiness deep inside your gut.|Fresh
These big, dark gaps in the film, like the darkness around that small lantern's glow, invite us to project our worst fears into them.|Fresh
A post-apocalyptic nightmare-and-a-half where the horrors of humanity ... bleed out through wary eyes and weathered hands.|Fresh
In the end, I was left hungry for a payoff that never came, and lamenting that It Comes At Night's mood and nightmares are not enough to be satisfyingly scary.|Rotten
It Comes at Night is a relentlessly bleak exercise in paranoia and distrust that taps into some of the deepest fears within the human condition.|Fresh
Fascinating thriller by a director who understands tension, isolation and uncontrollable fear.|Fresh
Methodical, moving at its own unhurried pace, content to revel in silence and the mundane minutia of surviving in a world no longer filled with modern amenities, Shults shows the same attention to detail he [displayed in Krisha].|Fresh
It's like being on a conveyor belt headed to a darkened doom.|Fresh
It quickly becomes a so-so horror thriller that takes us deep into the woods and some other dark places.|Fresh
The solid cast acts accordingly, with young Harrison distinguishing himself as a young man whose awkwardness is alternately endearing and alarming.|Fresh
Trey Edward Shults, who made the powerful, harrowing Krisha, returns with a dark movie that's meticulously crafted and highly intelligent but also relentlessly pessimistic and deeply unsettling.|Fresh
"It Comes at Night is a total success, building dread gradually and avoiding an overreliance on the kind of jump scares lesser films mine to absurdity. It makes ""It Comes at Night"" less fun, but more resonant."|Fresh
It's a genre picture bathed in overwhelming darkness and torment.|Fresh
Home is where good health isn't in It Comes at Night, a terrifying saga about the corruption of a clan's safe haven by both external and internal forces.|Fresh
Writer-director Trey Edward Shults' sophomore feature won't do much to reaffirm faith in humanity under pressure, but it will put the screws to the viewer for a lean, nerve-wracking 90 minutes.|Fresh
After the success of recent low-budget horror films like Split and Get Out, It Comes at Night is far more demanding, even brazen.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is a masterful work of spooky suspense. Writer-director Trey Edward Shults has created a claustrophobic gem of a movie.|Fresh
"Trey Edward Shults' stark, sobering, and quietly fascinating It Comes at Night is for genre fans who are in the market for something more cerebral and personal than the average ""end of the world"" story."|Fresh
Those expecting a horror movie that's filled with a lot of those gross and scary moments will likely be disappointed, while those who might appreciate the film's less horrific storytelling will probably be scared away by the marketing.|Rotten
There's a fresh mound of metaphysical content to mull over, and in the end, that's the only thing that redeems this somewhat unsatisfying horror experiment: We're forced to think about what we might do in the same situation...|Fresh
It Comes at Night is technically accomplished-in fact it looks exactly like a film that made the most of a small budget-and the acting is good within the limitations of the roles.|Fresh
"Not really sure - even after seeing the movie - what ""it"" is and why it comes at night. Low budget boring."|Rotten
"""It Comes at Night"" is one of the most vexing and discomforting experiences witnessed since ""The Snowtown Murders."""|Fresh
The capable cast can only do so much to disguise the thin, predictable, paranoid survival thriller they're trapped playing out.|Rotten
Despite what the film's marketing says, it's not a horror film, and it doesn't function well as one. But it is a pretty darn good dark psychological thriller.|Fresh
Texas prodigy Trey Edward Shults creates a Night of the Living Dead for these paranoid us-against them times.|Fresh
More than a big-picture, end-of-the-world drama, it succeeds as a grave - and highly confined - journey through desperate emotional states.|Fresh
...at times, literally crackles with claustrophobic tension.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is the feel-bad movie of the year. I can't help but feel as if audiences are going to hate it. And I can't blame them if they do.|Rotten
This is the thriller equivalent of setting the timer on unnerving and letting it simmer for 97 nerve-wracking minutes.|Fresh
Slices into the darkness of every scene with a razor's edge of finely calibrated suspense, tension, grief, paranoia and primal fear.|Fresh
In a summer full of cacophony and bluster, It Comes at Night sneaks in and grabs with sharp claws, if you open yourself to it.|Fresh
"That's the genius of 'It Comes at Night''s ambiguity: its horror is widely applicable, and its title both makes a promise and asks a question (What is ""it,"" and why is it coming?) that it doesn't answer. And, frankly, it doesn't have to."|Fresh
Throughout its brief 97-minute run time, It Comes at Night seems to be building to something that simply isn't there. If movies were still shown on film, you'd swear the final reel was missing.|Rotten
In the absence of such answers, or the intimation of such answers, or even of characters in pursuit of answers, It Comes at Night begins to seem thin, a torment without purpose.|Rotten
It Comes At Night will be too dark and grim for a lot a viewers, but those of you that are into such dark arts will revel in just how pulverizing and unnerving a ride it is.|Fresh
Shults has crafted a very admirable and challenging piece of cinema. But it's also one that enthralls while never truly ensnaring the audience or their fears.|Fresh
[A] spare but savage horror movie ...|Fresh
For those who acutely empathize with the ravages of grief, Shults has delivered a film more horrific than any boogeyman or ghoul in recent memory.|Fresh
It's grim, bleak, uncomfortable and certainly no fun -- but performances are excellent and Shults' atmosphere of soul-corroding terror is hard to dismiss.|Fresh
Mr. Shults doesn't jolt the audience with false scares or showy plot twists. He builds up the dread with ruthless efficiency and minimal gimmickry, relying on and refreshing some of the oldest techniques in the book.|Fresh
But it's the depiction of the loneliness and resignation in the surviving few that resounds the loudest, even when Shults's now-trademark minimalism becomes a hurdle he can't overcome.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is not an easily watched time at the cinema, but through its perilous devastation and mood is a rewarding and valuable time, spent with your own anxiety and the lump in your throat that you try to choke down.|Fresh
Shults builds an effective atmosphere of mistrust and dread, with even the slightest hint of deception eating away at the fragile alliance among the characters.|Fresh
"As he did in ""Krisha,"" Shults avoids the conventional trap of exposition, relying instead on his striking command of the medium to evoke the inner life of a family under extraordinarily bleak circumstances."|Fresh
To my mind, It Comes at Night traffics in a fatally depthless cruelty.|Rotten
I'm hard-pressed to think of a recent movie that's as uncomfortable and disturbing as It Comes at Night.|Fresh
It Comes at Night shows that no matter how much you can prepare for the worst, no one is ever actually ready for it.|Fresh
It Comes at Night works best in the moments when it drills down into the social dynamics of the six survivors.|Fresh
"For much of its brisk running time, ""It Comes at Night"" teeters between delicious atmosphere and almost unbearable tension."|Fresh
Edgerton and Abbott are so locked into their diametrically opposed roles that they cancel each other out, while Ejogo and Keough only exist in mutual counterpoint.|Rotten
This may be a film about the end of the world, but ... It Comes at Night tracks something akin to a domestic apocalypse.|Fresh
The film creates authentic tension out of unanswered questions, and that works until you realize that none of the questions will be answered, and that is a frustrating disappointment.|Rotten
Writer/director Trey Edward Shults is a dab hand at creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and menace and does a fine job of showing how people disintegrate under duress. The performances are very convincing here.|Fresh
It Comes at Night intends to be a cautionary tale about the corrosive, terrible power of fear, but its isolationist bent and thinly disguised xenophobic message also feel creepily and politically prescient.|Fresh
Shults follows up his excellent Krisha with a movie that solidifies him as a director I will follow consistently. He plays with darkness and claustrophobia onscreen, but also makes his characters deeply human and relatable.|Fresh
Harrowing, visually striking, and almost too on the nose for the current sociopolitical moment, It Comes at Night is one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
The superb cast does a wonderful job of keeping us guessing as to everyone's motives.|Fresh
Taut, smart, intense and genuinely scary, Trey Edward Shults's It Comes at Night fulfills the promise, and then some, of the filmmaker's 2015 debut feature, Krisha.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is very close to a masterpiece. Enveloped in dread and oozing with tension, it's one of the great recent studies of the fear that comes from a desire for survival.|Fresh
Although It Comes at Night isn't quite as striking or as intelligent as it wants to be, it's enjoyable and there are definitely a few scenes that will keep creeping you out until late into the night.|Fresh
Heavy on mood but light on ideas, this is the sort of movie that equates ambiguity and draggy pacing with seriousness.|Rotten
Shults has both the instincts and the technical facility to make pretty much any kind of atypical picture he wants.|Fresh
I wouldn't want to watch Trey Edward Shults' It Comes at Night alone. Unless you're a particularly sturdy soul, I wouldn't recommend that you do so either.|Fresh
Shults' film, which he also wrote, is a model of nightmare minimalism, trusting the audience to use their imagination to supply their own, patently more terrifying, idea of what the hell is shrieking out there in the forest.|Fresh
I kept wanting Shults' film to add up to a little more in the end. Still, his chops behind the camera are undeniable. I can't wait to see what he does next.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is a masterpiece of subjective storytelling.|Fresh
It's challenging, artfully made work from Shults, requiring those electing to see it to relax some expectations as the movie endeavors to unnerve, not shock.|Fresh
The tension Shults builds is incredible, nearly unbearable in the most-satisfying way.|Fresh
"""It Comes At Night"" is a harrowing, horrifying effort told with brute conviction, a quivering meditation on grief and alienation haunts you to the brittle bone."|Fresh
a modern, post-apocalyptic spin on the 1961 Twilight Zone episode 'The Shelter.' Shults' film, though, is far more unnerving, its twist more ironic and devastating.|Fresh
It Comes at Night may disappoint some hardcore horror fans with its artful avoidance of genre pleasures, but its grim, tough-minded dystopia will prove hard to shake for many.|Fresh
The rawness of ... emotion translates to a palpable intensity, with the fear of losing those closest to you, either through death or through betrayal, smothering the film like a wet wool blanket.|Fresh
The final scenes are both ambiguous and terrifying, and they left a preview audience as shaken as any I've seen.|Fresh
It is one dark and downbeat mofo of a movie.|Fresh
An intense psychological thriller, slow-boiling and unsettling.|Fresh
An effectively creepy and at times gut-wrenching take on the pandemic genre.|Fresh
You want horror that screws with your head? This is your ticket, a haunting story of two families surviving the postapocalypse proves there's a major new filmmaking talent in town, Trey Edward Shults|Fresh
Once again, Shults demonstrates his extreme resourcefulness as a filmmaker, wringing blood-curdling tension out of controlled camera movements, creative practical lighting, and a red door.|Fresh
It's the minimalist apocalyptic nightmare we never knew we needed, and a master class in lingering, universal fear.|Fresh
A savvy riff on our current cultural anxieties.|Fresh
As minimalist horror movies go, this is pretty effective.|Fresh
It Comes at Night is emotional, haunting dystopian horror that will leave you shaken.|Fresh
Trey Edward Shults's nerve-shredding domestic thriller joins the rarified company of Cormac McCarthy's 2006 novel The Road and the handful of intimate post-apocalyptic scenarios that puncture through to our deepest fears.|Fresh
A soul-crushingly dark examination of human nature amid an invisible and unnatural threat... impossibly tense|Fresh
Shults ... is a good filmmaker who knows how to get the most out of a limited budget and a stale situation.|Fresh
Conjures an unsettling aura but does so at a deliberate tempo where its characters' emotional journey and insular world takes precedence over predictable genre tactics.|Fresh
With all of Shults' dark-night-of-the-soul mood manipulations, the film promises more than it delivers. Its buildups are impressive, but in the end its frights are mild.|Rotten
It's bleak, man. It's bleak.|Rotten
Stressful, dark, and emotionally exhausting, It Comes At Night is a truly haunting experience, and I still can't get the very last shot out of my mind.|Fresh
Small, vivid moments, squeezed into a small physical and dramatic space, then tightened with a vice of suspense and dread.|Fresh
Trey Edward Shults is quickly ascending the ranks of the best young directors working and this will only further cement his rising status.|Fresh
The details in this post-apocalyptic chamber drama - flat-out horror this is not - are spare, an initially refreshing decision that ultimately results in a rather empty, half-formed narrative.|Fresh
Shults, in only his second feature following his splashy debut with the family psychodrama Krisha, stylishly and effectively builds tension and mystery in this stripped-down experiment that crescendos occasionally into the stuff of nightmares.|Fresh
"As in [his first film] ""Krisha,"" the most fraught and dangerous relationships are those of family and those who purport to be friends. For all of their flesh-eating ferocity, zombies won't lie to you or play games. Only the living do that."|Fresh
Often scarier for what it doesn't say or show, which may also make it somewhat frustrating, since you're never sure exactly what's happening either.|Fresh
A well-crafted, albeit entirely bleak exploration of paranoia and fear.|Fresh
While there is an underlying existential anxiety to the whole thing, there's not enough pizzazz to either the visuals or the dialogue to make It Comes at Night worth going to see in the theater.|Rotten
You see it to jump in your seat; you wind with something even freakier: you get to watch what it's like to live when life is no longer worth living.|Fresh
It Comes At Night will divide horror audiences, but that doesn't stop Trey Edward Shults' deadly-tense doomsday thriller.|Fresh
There's truly not a wasted moment in this film, which is astounding for such a young director.|Fresh
A nightmare within a nightmare|Fresh
There are no zombies in the streets, boogeymen in the basement or witches in the woods -- and yet it is one of the most terrifying films in years.|Fresh
This modest science-fiction thriller brings the hands-on vigor of independent filmmaking to a high-concept premise, but the results are insubstantial and impersonal.|Rotten
Whaddya expect to happen in a scary, spine-tingler with such a big hint in the title?|Fresh
"Just as Trey Edward Shults withholds the ""it"" of the title, he never attempts to justify the escalating paranoia of his characters."|Rotten
The tension is beautifully modulated and powerfully deployed in It Comes At Night, the expert sophomore feature from Krisha writer-director Trey Edward Shults.|Fresh
The film confirms that Shults, working again with DP Drew Daniels, has a sure and fluent grasp of cinematic storytelling, his stripped-down narrative pulsing with dread and emotion.|Fresh
The movie is a close-quarters psychological thriller built artfully and honestly, from the ground up, with more of a nod to early John Carpenter than mid-period Danny Boyle.|Fresh
The decisions the characters make throughout the film are deeply rooted in who they are, not strictly because this disease forces them to make that choice, and that makes It Comes At Night an all-consuming and deeply disturbing film.|Fresh
The film, like its director, offers no answers, nor does it need to. It's an unnerving, masterful piece of horror filmmaking.|Fresh
Once again, Shults has delivered a top-notch psychological thriller.|Fresh
Shults's film is many things-heart-wrenching, paced to perfection, a masterclass in visual storytelling and genuinely terrifying-but that nothing about it feels beyond the grasp of what Shults wants it to be, of what he knows it can be.|Fresh
