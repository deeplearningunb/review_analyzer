That the crime is ultimately unsuccessful isn't a shocker - the film acknowledges this within the first few moments - but this detail hardly matters, because what's so intriguing is why the boys chose to attempt this crime in the first place.|Fresh
The best quasi-docu-comedy of the year so far about a gang of not-quite criminal masterminds stealing rare books.|Fresh
A gripping heist movie with a surprising amount on its mind, and a film that feels tailor-made for our post-truth times.|Fresh
A spectacularly playful and entertaining film that blurs the line between documentary and drama.|Fresh
While the aftermath is known from the start, the trip to get there is riveting.|Fresh
Never manages to balance the documentary and drama elements to make a meaningful whole.|Rotten
If you've ever daydreamed about plotting a robbery of your own, this film will remind you that you probably aren't as smart as you think you are.|Fresh
While American Animals might be as ambitious as The Imposter, it fails to hit the same levels of brilliance though it remains an entertaining watch.|Fresh
Real and make-believe merge seamlessly in this true story of a rare books heist by students. Even knowing the outcome it's hugely exciting, though what is most interesting is their (lack of) motivation and the real men's re-evaluation of their exploits.|Fresh
You really can tell that a documentarian made this movie. That's a compliment too.|Fresh

You really can tell that a documentarian made this movie. That's a compliment too.|Fresh
[It] sounds like a fascinating tale on the surface of it. Regrettably, when given the gold star treatment it becomes clear that the players and events are not nearly so interesting as the film would have you believe.|Rotten
An absorbing, detailed, unintentionally humourous account of [a] hare-brained heist.|Fresh
Equal parts hilarious and gut wrenching, the laughs and the tragedy ooze through both the narrative and documentary elements of the film.|Fresh
This slick caper boasts a unique storytelling approach and gripping moments of high tension but struggles with pacing and periphery character development.|Fresh
The problem with American Animals is that Bart Layton is too often enamored with his own style at the expense of having anything of value to say.|Rotten
The story is quite compelling, and Layton handles the scenes with the four actors quite efficiently, delivering a solid heist picture that checks off all the boxes in the genre.|Fresh
What initially appears to be a slight, if entertaining, true-crime heist romp, in fact, hides untold depths in a muscular offering.|Fresh
Having already blurred the lines between drama and documentary with his Bafta-winning 2012 debut The Imposter, Bart Layton now mashes them together to audacious effect.|Fresh
It is a popcorn movie dripping with arthouse flair, and populated with intriguing and complex characters, be they real or performed.|Fresh
Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Backed by a killer soundtrack, American Animals is an exhilarating and bloody good movie from start to finish.|Fresh
Layton entwines documentary and performance to create a true-crime heist film. The result is something that feels experimental.|Fresh
American Animals is anything but your ordinary crime thriller.|Fresh
American Animals is an incredibly smart take on perception and what it means to truthfully recount and tell a story as it happened|Fresh
Wildly, gleefully entertaining; I can't recommend it enough ... Layton sets up and maintains a terrific, jovial tone, and even when things get heavy, we're allowed to enjoy the ride. [His] incredible score with The Imposter was no fluke; he's big league.|Fresh
Layton has a very contemporary skepticism that suits the era of fake news: a feeling that even - and perhaps especially - factual events become campfire stories destined to be misrepresented.|Fresh
American Animals is a different kind of movie, a truly electrifying story with purpose and meaning but one that has also given us a new form of storytelling.|Fresh
It's a clever movie, but not too clever. It's also thoughtful and engrossing, weird as hell. And it's true - or truer than most films that claim that label.|Fresh
A fine movie which would also make for a ripping multi-part podcast.|Fresh
Regardless of the over-speculation, the movie works when it's hilarious and intense because we are invested in the result of the unlikely caper. After a long build-up, it's the boys' actions that matter most.|Fresh
Don't get it twisted: American Animals isn't merely a thought experiment about who gets to claim ownership of the truth. It's also a cracking heist flick.|Fresh
While [the] dedicated cast works hard to make the characters seem real, they're never anything but unpleasant and staggeringly deluded.|Rotten
Here's a movie that takes a tattered genre and manages to add some fresh elements to it.|Fresh
American Animals, like the young thieves whose story it tells, seeks inspiration from classic movies, but it transcends this foundation in a probing look at the arrogance and inexperience of its protagonists...|Fresh
As Layton makes sexy fiction an on-screen accomplice to messier reality, he gradually focuses on the violent consequences that the young men prefer to erase from their visionary plot.|Fresh
American Animals thrives on its messy humanity, giving a soul to these forgettable criminals but still pointing a finger at their foolishness in the process.|Fresh
Special mention must be given to the performance of young Irish rising star Barry Keoghan.|Fresh
It's a clever film even when its characters are the opposite.|Fresh
An incredibly astute combination of documentary interviews and dramatic re-enactments.|Fresh
Technically it's almost show-offy which...does perhaps make the film a little soulless on occasion, but overall it makes for an original and entertaining tale.|Fresh
Supremely watchable and surprisingly poignant...|Fresh
A very haunting film.|Fresh
At times, the film seems as hardboiled as the heist thrillers that Warren and Spencer study on DVD but the director never loses sight of the absurdity of the plan or of the bungling amateurism of the perpetrators.|Fresh
Their exploits are intercut with the reflections of the real protagonists, and surprisingly, this odd mix of documentary and drama works.|Fresh
This is one expertly crafted, bat-s**t crazy heist flick, and you know what else? It's up there with the best of them.|Fresh
A stylish, entertaining, well-acted and unpredictable mini-crime saga.|Fresh
Other directors have folded real-world figures into fictional narratives. It's the scale of the invasion that sets Layton's project apart.|Fresh
The complex relationship between truth and fiction lies at the very heart of this fascinating crime film.|Fresh
But as the men learn, violent crime isn't fun, or glamorous - it's terrifying and anxiety-laden and ultimately, doomed. But my god, is it fun to watch.|Fresh
A pure bonkers masterpiece.|Fresh
The hazy difference in the story's events and details depending on who is recalling is a masterstroke.|Fresh
Layton allows events to unfold with a distinctly comedic edge, referencing Reservoir Dogs and even Jaws, which makes his movie both extremely watchable and thoroughly disingenuous.|Fresh
The film functions as a sad indictment of social system that perpetuates the myth that the biggest crime is being ordinary.|Fresh
The movie reaches strange and savage heights...not just because it seems to be engaging with huge philosophical questions about the nature of identity in the modern world. It's more focused than that, because the context is specifically American.|Fresh
From minute one, the film comes in steamrolling with madcap confidence and assured style.|Fresh
It's really the style and performances, more than the pseudo-experimental structure Layton has chosen, that keep the film grabby.|Fresh
This is a film that takes deep pleasure in itself. Much of the time, you will be pleased with it too.|Fresh
American Animals manages to be simultaneously fast-paced and contemplative.|Fresh
The trick of American Animals is that the film creates powerfully gripping drama, even as we inwardly beg for the lads to call a halt.|Fresh
I was on the edge of my seat.|Fresh
Layton's trump cards are the five real people, who command the screen effortlessly, looking even better than their Hollywood counterparts.|Fresh
A documentary about the fictions we tell ourselves, a fiction about the reality we can never escape.|Fresh
Fuses documentary and drama in a masterfully balanced, insightful and impactful amalgam.|Fresh
American Animals is sharp, smart, often bravura filmmaking, a terrifically entertaining mix of fast facts and pulp fiction. But beneath the flash is a sad story of teens who feel their lives simply aren't good enough.|Fresh
An ingenious fusion of documentary and docudrama, American Animals fires a seemingly conventional heist film through a prism of questionable truth, abetted by marvellous performances and tenacious style.|Fresh
There are lots of moments of levity and humor...these are interesting characters.|Fresh
It's really worth seeing if you're just interested in film and how people can and do sometimes play with form, because [director Bart Layton] does it really well.|Fresh
[An] entertaining thrill ride to vicariously experience the danger of creating needless drama simply because you were lucky enough to avoid the type many face without choice.|Fresh
The film works best when it digs into the American preoccupation with unlimited potential, the individual's specialness.|Fresh
The visual flair and smart casting shows a lot of potential and I look forward to what Layton brings us next.|Fresh
Every actor turns in a enthralling performance and the four subjects have sincere, intelligent, and charismatic personalities. But it doesn't change the fact that making a film about them is an advertisement for while-male privilege in America.|Fresh
While there is a lot going on in American Animals, it is the performances in the movie which ultimately sell it. At its roots, this is still a character drama.|Fresh
Immensely crafted with detailed passion, commitment, and respect to the people associated to this unfortunate crime, American Animals is a powerful film.|Fresh
The middle-class kids chose the wrong prank. A seven-year sentence is a dandy proscenium breaker.... And we, the audience, get to vicariously experience an entertaining cautionary tale.|Fresh
A tonal mess of a movie that highlights inconsistencies between differing perspectives, while also reveling in the outright absurdity of what becomes an overly complicated plot.|Rotten
Look out 2018, here's the bar.|Fresh
Maybe they were just spoilt kids with a false sense of grandeur... Whatever it was, it made for a great and almost comical story, and Layton brings it home.|Fresh
Though it's mostly doing the expected thing, American Animals does it with great energy.|Fresh
"American Animals doesn't need an ""easy out"" to explain its characters' poor decisions. The propulsive energy of the movie, once it starts to take shape, mirrors the inevitability of them seeing their bad idea all the way through."|Fresh
[VIDEO ESSAY] Bart Layton adds a meaty layer of social realism to the film. Get out your knife and fork; this is one movie you can really sink your teeth into.|Fresh
There's something troubling about American Animals, but I think deliberately so. It sticks in your craw.|Fresh
Though ambitious, this documentary-feature hybrid, which includes both actors and the real-life characters they play, fails to fully engage or inspire much empathy.|Rotten
Layton manages to successfully separate this true-life film from other biographical films, mixing his re-enactments with elements of documentary.|Fresh
...we know these guys are doomed to failure, we just don't know exactly how or how much collateral damage they'll do in the process.|Fresh
Falling well short of a cautionary tale, the message declines from respecting others to just stop being stupid.|Rotten
In Bart Layton's immensely entertaining and unexpectedly thoughtful caper thriller, the line between taking part in a robbery and play-acting in a movie about a robbery is a thin one.|Fresh
Storytellers, at the end of the day, are the greatest con artists, because the best of them know which strings to pull to make us believe.|Fresh
The film offers a window into the millennial advent of purely nihilistic materialism.|Rotten
The combination of the two approaches is ambitious and daring and often exciting to watch, but like the bold and foolhardy crime it depicts, the end result is a bit of a mess.|Fresh
There are scenes where we feel real fear for these characters, and what starts as a comedy of errors sometimes twists into a drama of errors instead, particularly as the boys get deeper into their plan.|Fresh
The botched heist makes for much suspense and slapstick comedy.|Fresh
More than mere truth or fiction, fact or fakery; American Animals is a repackaging of modern cultural mythology.|Fresh
Filmmaker Bart Layton punctuates American Animals with interviews with the story's real-life figures...|Fresh
Shallow, if stylishly suspenseful, relating a criminal caper that goes awry.|Fresh
"""Animals"" a gripping tale of misspent youth."|Fresh
American Animals plays out as a hall-of-mirrors examination of responsibility and memory, both of which are aggravated by the heedlessness of these entitled college kids...|Fresh
This sort of self-awareness usually works on me like catnip, but Layton's concept of meta-cinema feels extremely basic.|Rotten
It doesn't quite work all the time, but give Layton credit for understanding the essential selfishness of his characters' actions and for crediting the real terror and damage they dealt out.|Fresh
We know the outcome of the heist, yet [Bart] Layton's film makes it difficult not to root for the foursome to emerge from this episode unscathed.|Fresh
Not since A Clockwork Orange has the pack mentality of young males been examined this compellingly.|Fresh
Without the documentary components, the film would still be more enjoyable than a lot of movies where...a crack team of beautiful misfits...steal a bag of bling. With them, Layton has discovered a new and extraordinary way of storytelling.|Fresh
"""American Animals"" twists and turns conventional heist movie formulas into a riotous blend, thereby delivering a wildly creative, tragicomic remix."|Fresh
The most repugnant aspect of American Animals is the limitless sympathy it offers the privileged criminals who are its primary characters...|Rotten
It makes viewers care so much about what drove them to be as feckless as they were reckless.|Fresh
The bleak comedy of the film's first half gives way to a more sombre mood in the second.|Fresh
American Animals offers a truly poignant look at what it costs us to cross an invisible line between right and wrong.|Fresh
American Animals is a meticulous and highly creative exploration into the vagaries of human nature.|Fresh
American Animals was an intriguing, well acted, and diabolically clever film.|Fresh
American Animals is a wild, rollicking story that makes us question how authenticity can be integrated into narrative filmmaking.|Fresh
"The ""other"" heist movie that can be found in theaters is the better of the two. This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It's a bit slow in the middle but that's forgivable."|Fresh
"A fascinating study of disaffected youth so devoid of empathy they can't conceive of their ""little prank"" hurting anyone but themselves."|Fresh
Layton takes cues from the most grandiloquent visual devices of cinematic masters-monsters like Michael Mann, Oliver Stone and Tony Scott and just gets on with it in his tonally insolent thriller.|Fresh
There is no denying that Bart Layton has once again found a creative way to play with the structure of biopics and reality versus dramatization|Fresh
The stylistic gambles that Layton takes pay off in that they add depth to what is a shallow story about young American ennui. However, the movie's artistic merits are not enough to make the men at the center of the story worth caring about.|Rotten
I kind of loved the Rashomon trick Layton waits until the best possible moment to reveal.|Fresh
Instead of thinking what a lark this all is, we realize somebody is going to get hurt because of these jackasses.|Fresh
While a narrative approach would have been just as compelling, American Animals does right by their subjects.|Fresh
Combining narrative with talking head interviews, and by having them play off each other as the story progresses, Layton has synthesized a scathingly brilliant cinema genre: the non-fiction narrative.|Fresh
What we have here ... is an entertaining mishmash of fiction and reality.|Fresh
An examination of the potentially dangerous entitlement of bored young men.|Fresh
"""American Animals"" is fascinating, funny and, in the end, deep."|Fresh
"""American Animals"" evokes the feeling of an anxiety dream, specifically the common one in which you know you've done something bad and irrevocable and now must live with the consequences."|Fresh
"Thanks to Layton's filmmaking choices, ""American Animals"" ends up being not so much a crime movie as an examination of truth and memory, as well as blame and responsibility."|Fresh
Director Layton makes a conventional narrative film, a companion documentary, splices them together, and actually blends them - putting real people in dramatized scenes.|Fresh
Crucially, there's humanity in this picture of four young men self-destructing, and the cast sizzles.|Fresh
The visually arresting, cannily constructed 'American Animals'... is more impressive for its surface slickness and narrative trickery than for psychological depth. Still, though the impact may be ephemeral, it's potent while you're watching.|Fresh
Which makes me wonder if Layton should have jettisoned the film's documentary elements entirely... Still, American Animals is interesting and entertaining enough that these questions just make me want to see it again.|Fresh
The drama palpably, potently conveys the group's misgivings, their jangling nerves, the foolhardy resignation pushing them on despite themselves.|Fresh
The film squanders [its] potential.|Rotten
A stylish and engaging caper.|Fresh
"There's a psychological examination worth pursuing here, but ""American Animals"" is too soft on the subjects and the filmmaking draws attention to itself."|Rotten
A mesmerizing blend of narrative and documentary storytelling that would seem too far-fetched to believe if it was just another run-of-the-mill thriller.|Fresh
... conceived and executed on a much higher level than the outrageous true-life criminal scheme it depicts.|Fresh
Perhaps the greatest trick up its sleeve is how deftly it weaves together different genres.|Fresh
Confusing? Not a bit. Writer/director Bart Layton employs all the tricks in the docufiction playbook...[to] create a uniquely tricky heist flick and he makes sure the audience can keep up.|Fresh
The state the film produces in its viewers - or in this one, at least - is something like muted dread coupled with weary amusement.|Fresh
How you feel about this film hinges solely on whether you think this redemption is warranted. I did not.|Rotten
An innovative hybrid of documentary and heist flick.|Fresh
It's a film that tosses questions at the viewer with no interest in answering them, one that can't decide if it feels for its subjects or just wants to mock their incompetence.|Rotten
American Animals is one fact-based heist frolic with a youthful slant that works in spite of itself.|Fresh
The holes in the script are a pesky issue, but filmmaker Bart Layton's blend of recreations and real-life participants commenting on the action gives this true-crime comedy an edge.|Fresh
Layton's movie is slick, perhaps a little too slick at times (compositions are sometimes too studied), but the filmmaker is talented...Interviews with real subjects are seamlessly edited into the fictionalized action.|Fresh
When dealing with a character who comes across larger than life, it's easy to overplay the role. [Evan] Peters has just enough energy and charisma to make this work.|Fresh
Bart Layton's tentative foray into fictional narrative is a success in melding the best personal aspects of documentary journalism with the emotional impact of cinematic performance.|Fresh
Layton shatters the brittle lines of cinematic convention, then pieces the jagged edges back together to form a decoupage of fiction and reality.|Fresh
But the robbery isn't sophisticated enough on its own to hold one's interest, and [director Bart] Layton's tactic of cutting to the members of the real-life robbery team, and having them weigh in on the action, short-circuits the film's electricity.|Rotten
There are more than two sides to this tale, however, and the filmmakers give us the fun and interesting view of a crime gone comically bad.|Fresh
This clever, twisty, incredible-but-true story also explores the nature of friendship and the difficulty of pulling off a crime. It's smart entertainment, a nice piece of counter-programming in the midst of so many mass-audience blockbusters.|Fresh
Writer-director Bart Layton's slick, music-fueled assemblage of recreated narrative and documentary manages to be as deftly comic and suspenseful as the bank job movies from which Layton, and the incident's perpetrators, took inspiration.|Fresh
Stuffed with references to classic crime flicks, American Animals is British writer-director Bart Layton's clever and assured bid to rival Stanley Kubrick and Quentin Tarantino.|Fresh
Miraculously American Animals manages to have the pace and tension of a thriller and the empathic fascination of true-crime journalism.|Fresh
American Animals is a stylish, entertaining and disturbing movie, a well-worn tale that's familiar and, paradoxically, brand-new.|Fresh
For this true-crime movie, writer/director Bart Layton attempts a new angle and succeeds.|Fresh
"While the participants in ""American Animals"" only imagine they're different, the film about them is the real deal."|Fresh
"There's a kernel of something interesting in the film, and it's the movement between performance and ""reality"" that makes it work."|Fresh
The lack of a concrete tone or a script that makes the emotions more solid lets the movie down, but it's ultimately an interesting and unique journey that will appeal to true crime enthusiasts.|Fresh
Although this might not all tonally flow, it's clear you're watching a dazzling new directorial career taking flight.|Fresh
Although featuring some good acting, and certainly ambitious in its critique of the characters, American Animals is too sleepy to strike a chord.|Fresh
The reality-bending narrative device turns an otherwise so-so true-crime dramedy into something noteworthy.|Fresh
It's a mundane stupid-crime story decked out with empty postmodern frills.|Rotten
"There is something soulless and mechanical about ""American Animals,"" as if it had been made by a Martin Scorsese smartphone app and scored to a Spotify classic rock playlist."|Rotten
Excellent heist drama with a real life twist that sets it apart from the pack in this genre. A terrific on-screen ensemble of the real and the reel makes this a keeper.|Fresh
The movie turned my stomach.|Rotten
Layton roots the story in a mixture of peer pressure, toxic masculinity, and the dread of young men who feel the fruits of capitalism growing beyond their reach.|Fresh
As he showed in The Imposter, writer-director Bart Layton knows how to spin a compelling yarn.|Fresh
Bart Layton's movie tells a true story, more or less, with an emphasis on the stories that the characters tell themselves, and the inevitable trouble that ensues.|Fresh
Director Bart Layton captures the humor in the heist.|Fresh
Clever to the point of bloody brilliant|Fresh
American Animals feels like a new kind of true-crime thriller: one that shamelessly rewrites its truths in real time as it goes.|Fresh
Director Bart Layton's heist yarn is an exhilarating exercise in art imitating life (that was imitating art).|Fresh
The fascinating insights of American Animals come from exploring just why these four college students decided to steal the books in the first place.|Fresh
It becomes, surprisingly enough, a stealth act of media critique.|Fresh
The heist genre is one that's been done to death, but with American Animals, filmmaker Bart Layton manages to pull off something wholly unique.|Fresh
It's a wild ride that shakes up a common narrative by way of a refreshingly multifaceted approach. It's about time someone made a heist film like this.|Fresh
Moreover, Layton stylishly smashes true crime into the film obsessions that powered the man-child posse. Part The Thin Blue Line, part The Taking of Pelham 123, it's an all-American tale of self-destruction through delusion.|Fresh
American Animals is like watching the project of the most technically talented film student, but who has absolutely nothing to say.|Rotten
The rich genre of crime film in which dumbasses get themselves in way over their heads has a proud new entry with American Animals.|Fresh
American Animals brilliantly confronts the epistemological conundrum at the heart of crafting truthful non-fiction while simultaneously undercutting the tools that fiction films use to elevate these based-on-life tales.|Fresh
Without Layton's unconventional style, American Animals would just be another heist movie. But with the documentary style woven into the narrative, it turns into a film about privilege and the lies of the American Dream.|Fresh
American Animals is fiercely entertaining from start to finish, even when its characters are acting so dumb that you start to suspect they still have some more evolving to do.|Fresh
The film is long, and it's not nearly as fun as it wants to be.|Rotten
It's interesting that AMERICAN ANIMALS is one of the few movies in recent memory where I didn't feel the leads had to be likable.|Fresh
Layton's style is in service of a story for which he never found the hook to justify telling it.|Rotten
American Animals is ultimately a fairly straightforward heist movie, albeit a stylish and engaging one.|Fresh
A crackerjack real-life heist thriller.|Fresh
A riveting college-boy crime caper that tiggers along on pure movie-movie adrenalin, before U-turning into a sobering reflection on young male privilege and entitlement.|Fresh
A supremely-crafted doc/fiction hybrid which is genuinely innovative, pleasingly entertaining and deliciously more than the sum of its parts.|Fresh
As a crime-thriller, it's suitably nerve-wracking and ludicrous, while somehow still poignant and thoughtful.|Fresh
Bart Layton's wildly entertaining and inventive American Animals, which is like Tarantino's iconic heist flick and a docudrama rolled into one.|Fresh
