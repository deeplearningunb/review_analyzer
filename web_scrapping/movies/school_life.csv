An unexpected humor that the camera captures with subtlety. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Boarding school, especially for these youngsters (aged eight to 12) has rarely looked more appealing.|Fresh
... a gentle, warm and enchanting observational film...|Fresh
It leaves us with a great lesson: that education and dreams start at home, but are formed and fostered in school. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
School Life provides a rare glimpse of a system of teaching and nurturing that seems to be a rarity this year, one in which an institution fulfills the multiple roles of a surrogate family.|Fresh
It's touching to see the affection this Mr and Mrs Chips have for their pupils.|Fresh
File this charming documentary alongside Être et Avoir in the list of films that make the case that teachers are the closest thing we have to superheroes in everyday life.|Fresh
An appealingly good-natured piece, chock-full of beautifully-observed moments, in both the teachers and pupils lives.|Fresh
There are some lovely observations from the directors Neasa Ni Chianáin and David Rane, especially the scenes of music lessons.|Fresh
Imagine Fred Wiseman directing a remake of School of Rock but in Ireland and you're almost there, but with more incidental music and a closer focus on the charming characters.|Fresh

Perhaps the filmmakers tried to do too much, include too much, film too much.|Rotten
"Late in the film John says of a pupil emerging from her almost cartoonish shyness ""I wish you could bottle that and sell it."" Well Ní Chianáin and Rane have, and it's called School Life. Go buy it."|Fresh
School Lifeserves as an intimate all-access pass to a rustic piece of Irish heaven. N Chianin and Rane offer a simple yet soothing salve which shows how an educational experience can provide worldly experience and confidence building.|Fresh
I don't know if you can extrapolate larger educational meanings from School Life, but I do know that I would have loved to attend such a school, this one located on the remnants of a large estate.|Fresh
School Life, on the whole, captures a world in which the attitude and approach of teachers are crucial to the responsiveness and success of their students.|Fresh
School Life remains endearingly naturalistic from start to finish, shying away from any of the cloying gimmicks documentaries too often cling to.|Fresh
Using an observational verite style, the film manages to pay tribute to its subjects without turning preachy or sentimental.|Fresh
A thoroughly entertaining documentary set in an Irish prep school where two eccentric teachers draw out the students' creativity.|Fresh
Boarding school doc has sweet messages; some smoking.|Fresh
"""School Life"" is a delightful little film. It's a true respite from some of the other nonsense at the cinema."|Fresh
"""School Life"" is not a documentary in the traditional sense. No one is interviewed, nobody offers their opinion about any subject while looking into a camera. All we see are ever-changing snippets of life at the Headfort School in Ireland"|Fresh
The filmmakers demonstrate mastery of documentary style by achieving an extraordinary level of on-camera comfort with their subjects, intimate access where everyone seems unaware they are being filmed.|Fresh
School Life is unfortunately committed to keeping its subjects, especially Headfort's students, at arm's length.|Rotten
School Life is a bit woolly in its pacing, but the picture's easygoing structure is part of its charm-it mimics, perhaps, the passage of time at Headfort itself.|Fresh
The central couple's unforced benevolence is hard to resist ...|Fresh
A celebration of the importance of teachers and putting faith into the next generation of kids, School Life is quite the pleasing little documentary.|Fresh
Really, none of In Loco Parentis is particularly new or exciting... But it certainly succeeds in being a joyous, humane look at the role that school, education, and, most importantly, teachers have in the lives of such malleable minds.|Fresh
Everything in and about this film is eccentric, old-fashioned, [and] charmingly anachronistic.|Fresh
From shooting in the dormitories at night to recording in the homes of teachers, filmmaker Neasa Ní Chianáin and her partner and co-director, David Rane, have really managed to get an all-access pass to the school.|Fresh
A gentle and often whimsical look at the art of raising children at Ireland's only primary boarding school.|Fresh
In Loco Parentis remains a lovely, likeable picture, but one that, ironically, might have benefitted from some old-school discipline.|Fresh
Ostensibly documenting a year in the life of Headfort School... the Spanish co-production instead quickly reveals itself as an irresistibly admiring portrait of long-married couple John and Amanda Leyden, both staff members for over 40 years.|Fresh
This is a film with tons of charm.|Fresh
It's hard not to be moved by the dedication and affection that the Headfort staff -- given a bit more individual scrutiny here than the children -- put into their work.|Fresh
[The film] thrives whenever it regards Headfort as a place suspended between an ancient institution and an overgrown home, one that fosters both the transient children and the adults who have become part of the furniture.|Fresh
