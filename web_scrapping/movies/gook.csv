The timing of Gook... seems very relevant, and I urge everyone to see it.|Fresh
There's a remarkably emotional undercurrent through every scene, with tiny details that take the breath away.|Fresh
A powerful tale of kinship in the face of adversity.|Fresh
In rooftop conversations, an impressionistic dance sequence that takes place in a parking lot and a devastating conclusion that teeters on the edge of melodrama, Chon finds a tone all of his own.|Fresh
It's witty, stylish and ultimately devastating.|Fresh
A progressive, refreshing take on the unseen stories of the LA riots.|Fresh
A punchy, freewheeling movie set around the LA riots, shot in black-and-white, with something of Spike Lee's style.|Fresh
The spirit of early Spike Lee infuses this patchy but energetic sophomore feature by writer-actor-director Justin Chon.|Fresh
Has much to say on America's racial melting pot that feels pertinent.|Fresh

Has much to say on America's racial melting pot that feels pertinent.|Fresh
|Fresh
The racial discussions happening throughout are far from simplistic or rudimentary, this fearless multidimensionality giving Chon's script an impressive edge that's invigorating.|Fresh
Works best in its slow, steady moments, which allow its characters to breathe and help the film's sense of time and place flower to life.|Fresh
[John] Chon shows a definite talent for drawing out strong performances from his actors, as well as marshaling expressive imagery that's enhanced by Roger Suen's lyrical music score.|Fresh
"Like ""Clerks"" with a conscience."|Fresh
Justin Chon's Gook, an admittedly uneven film with a lot on its mind, acts as an ever-present undercurrent to a particular form of racial strife.|Fresh
The cacophonous result comes a lot closer to recapturing the spirit of Crash than to recapturing the spirit of 1990s independent cinema.|Rotten
... it's as if  Gook  came out at the exact time we needed it.|Fresh
Although it's rough around the edges, the expected low-budget trappings work mostly to the benefit of this gritty and evocative drama.|Fresh
Poignant, powerful black-and-white drama set amid '92 riots.|Fresh
Gook is a movie that's very aware of its history, both good and bad.|Fresh
Now with Gook, Chon combines his innate talent for building immediately likable and relatable characters with natural chemistry amongst his cast to tell a more socially substantive story.|Fresh
It's a heartfelt passion project that marks Chon as a filmmaker to watch.|Fresh
Gook is a bite-sized film with giant implications.|Fresh
[Gook] slipped on the words, but understood the music.|Fresh
Raw and compelling from its poetic opening shot to its gut-punch finale, Gook doesn't always find the best way to express itself, but it knows what needs to be said.|Fresh
There's not much to take away from the movie besides its sound and fury.|Rotten
Chon directs with style and a humane eye for all parties; he's a dynamic young director to keep your eye on.|Fresh
Justin Chon proves he can deliver cinematic art that impresses on both an aesthetic and thematic level.|Fresh
Chon's drama is uneven but bristling with life, and it offers a new perspective on a calamitous moment, one whose 25th anniversary has been commemorated in recent months with a slew of potent documentaries.|Fresh
[Justin] Chon has a vision and a voice and a good story to tell, full of social relevance and fiery emotion. Something this energetic and cared for is hard to criticize all that much.|Fresh
Chon's black-and-white indie throwback is cinematic, emotional, and authentic-yet undeniably problematic.|Fresh
"Director, writer and actor Justin Chon remembers the 1992 LA Riots with a rare Korean-American perspective in ""Gook,"" which reveals itself as a poignant picture of race and friendship."|Fresh
"A touching, disheartening and surprising Korean-American ""Do the Right Thing."""|Fresh
It fumbles the take on how its characters' anger fits into the greater landscape of L.A. during the aftermath of the Rodney King beating.|Rotten
Capitalizes on the chemistry between and eleven-year-old African-American girl and two Asian-American retailers.|Fresh
We'll definitely be seeing more from actor/director Chon in the future.|Fresh
With appropriately fiery performances from the entire ensemble, Gook is irresistible - equal parts harrowing and hilarious, not to mention thoroughly moving throughout.|Fresh
Nodding to Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing and Kevin Smith's Clerks, this sophomore feature exemplifies the grunge and angst-ridden energy of the 90s, with a humorous streak as frank as its racially charged title.|Fresh
Gook may not come close to the electric greatness of Lee's 1989 film but, as a gesture in its direction, it's alive with biting promise.|Fresh
[Chon]'s message is as powerful and heartfelt as his performance.|Fresh
Chon's sophomore feature wavers uncertainly in tone, getting a little too cute for comfort in spots, but is otherwise a lively, auspicious breakthrough.|Fresh
Chon doesn't quite have the instincts of a great filmmaker yet, but if 'Gook' is occasionally amateurish, it also burns with a young artist's raw intensity.|Fresh
[Gook] has the air of someone working through ideas, but damn if you can't see the passion in every single frame of this movie.|Fresh
Gook rises above message-movie mediocrity, enjoying its characters too much to use them as political mouthpieces.|Fresh
