In clear rebellion from the Saga franchise, Edwards has taken Star Wars in a glorious new direction.|Fresh
I know that for the next few years, at least, I'll see fewer and fewer interesting, engaging, stories, and more and more interchangeable shells surrounding interchangeable explosions.|Rotten
[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story] is a full and engaging addition to the Star Wars canon, the sort of striking cinematic experience that is reminiscent of the reasons we came to love the Star Wars in the first place.|Fresh
Edwards submits a distinct, though ultimately uneven work that never quite manages to become the spectacle or ensemble piece it hopes to be.|Rotten
Rogue One demonstrates that filmmakers can still do great things and expand this fascinating universe. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The first half felt like all action and no real character development, by the end of the film I found myself caring for the Rebel team as they undertook their last mission...|Fresh
Rogue One isn't a bad film, but it has some serious problems, which prevent it from being great.|Fresh
The truth is, what Rogue One truly succeeds at is repackaging a familiar experience so expertly that it feels unique.|Rotten
Chirrut's abilities borderline the trope of portraying disability as a superpower, but thankfully writers avoid offense by giving him a personality and character development that has nothing to do with his eyesight.|Fresh

This is the prequel we were looking for.|Fresh
Having people of all racial, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds gives Star Wars the legitimacy it needs as both a contemporary film in a multicultural world and as a space opera itself.|Fresh
An engrossing tale of war showing the hearts of those who fight it, fans of all ages are likely to find a resonant story worth telling.|Fresh
"A truly worthy entry in the ""[Wo]men on a mission"" subgenre of war film, Rogue One roars triumphantly into theaters as one of the very best Star Wars films ever made."|Fresh
It may be the best suicide squad movie of 2016.|Rotten
I enjoyed every minute of it.|Fresh
As a piece of fan fiction, Rogue One neatly ties into the original movie in an impressive way. But as a piece of cinema, it is entirely inconsequential and no amount of impressive special effects can hide the fact that it is soul crushingly dull.|Rotten
What Rogue One does differently than its predecessors is turn the black-and-white dichotomy of the Empire and the Rebellion on its axis.|Fresh
"When Rogue One is following the ""cool and different"" edict, that's when it's awesome"|Fresh
The nadir of this film's cynical, marketed traipse through the iconography of its franchise is in the preposterously pantomime mythologisation of Darth Vader.|Rotten
Anyone worried that the Mouse House might take the edge off the franchise should take comfort in Rogue One being probably the grittiest entry since The Empire Strikes Back in 1980.|Fresh
It really puts the 'wars' of this franchise front-and-centre like never before, and what it lacks in depth and polish it more than makes up for with spectacle and grit.|Fresh
It's a mixed bag of a Star Wars movie, so it's basically par for the course.|Fresh
Its loyal to the franchise without ever being slavish, and it bends the established story at just the right angle, giving the saga's central conflict a new kind of life.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the worst theatrically released Star Wars yet. I know that many will lambast the work that George Lucas did in this prequel trilogy, but I have a soft spot for his vision with those films.|Rotten
For those who grew up loving Star Wars, but have wanted the film series to grow up and become more nuanced and dangerous along with them, Rogue One does this, while still squarely existing within the design and narrative parameters of the universe.|Fresh
This film brings something slightly different to the Star Wars universe while at the same time giving us a lot more of what we already know and love.|Fresh
Great battle scenes, heartfelt characters, and the knowledge that there can only ever be one make this a real gem amongst stones that have, at times, struggled to shine.|Fresh
A surprisingly dark yet brilliantly action packed and fun anthology film|Fresh
When the action pivots on the exciting plot point of data transfer rates ... this mundane crisis doesn't seem elevated to a planetary level of urgency.|Rotten
As the Rogue One draws to its utterly stunning space-battle close, it seems to feel it needs to hold hands with A New Hope - when it really just needs to pass the baton.|Fresh
Edwards has a keen sense of awe and little regard for the humans underfoot.|Rotten
I wanted to feel more in the trenches with these guys...but the action that was there was really good...I liked it more than the Force Awakens, and if you are a Star Wars fan, I'd say go see this right away.|Fresh
It has everything hard core Star Wars fans want -- a feisty heroine, comic relief, quirky and unlikely heroes, incredible sets, and a soaring score.|Fresh
There is zero depth here. You keep hoping for a transgressive moment that will make the cringe-inducing dialogue and gratuitous fan service worthwhile, but it never comes.|Rotten
If you miss this point, the sacrifices of a revolution, then you will not understand the greatness of Rogue One.|Fresh
This is the plot-driven space opera (with delightful elements of a space western) that I wanted/needed.|Fresh
Rogue One is an enjoyable addition to the franchise and Jones's Jyn is a compelling lead.|Fresh
hankfully, with a cast like this one, you're treated to a vast array of characters to cling on to. Some of them feel more like action figures than characters, but it's a delight to have characters that are colourful - in more than one sense of the word.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a reminder of your dreams, of the barriers you'd break to create a better world, one full of hope and liberty where the word sacrifice takes on a whole new meaning... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
While we don't have the same nostalgic attachment to Cassian, Bodhi and Jyn, that's what unburdens Rogue One, giving it a freedom to tell a story on its own terms.|Fresh
It was nice to see something that was set in the Star Wars universe, but had a different tone to it.|Fresh
By shifting to a higher power characters actually cry out to, Edwards achieves a rousing tale of honor and sacrifice that both deepens and broadens the rest of the Star Wars world.|Fresh
When the film slows down enough for the dialogue to sink in, we realize that the story, such as it is, has been cobbled together from all previousStar Wars films combined.|Rotten
... the flaws in the film are in that first hour of build up the rest of the movie is really good if not great...|Fresh
While I loved The Force Awakens, it relied a lot on the nostalgia...But this movie? It could stand on its own and still be amazing.|Fresh
Can I just say that I liked Rogue One: A Star Wars Story better than the last four Star Wars stories--even The Force Awakens, which was the top grossing film of 2015?|Fresh
"The action in ""Rogue One"" is extremely well-staged and exciting, and it's fun to see its small connections to the larger ""Star Wars"" universe..."|Fresh
... the directing is heavy-handed and uninspired, the plot with its many turns - lots of action that includes more fight scenes than the saga's other movies - develops predictably, even if it's not always easy to follow.|Rotten
[Rogue One] is thrilling, at times dark, but also extremely entertaining regardless of your Star Wars knowledge.|Fresh
The ending is filled with both a bittersweet tragedy and hard-fought victory; ' a new hope' is earned, and so is this film's place in the upper echelon of Star Wars lore.|Fresh
There are Suicide Squad-level moments of confusion, weak characters and regressive storytelling that left me downright angry.|Rotten
...this is a film that gives us another strong independent woman such as Jyn in the Star Wars universe and we need more of them.|Fresh
"It is now a great starting point for someone new to this franchise. To quote one of the familiar lines from this space opera - ""the Force is strong with this one""!"|Fresh
This is Star Wars for adults. Well-loved characters die, the violence is gory by and large and the atmosphere is more on the lines of the French Resistance during World War II than the light-hearted thrillers that George Lucas films were.|Fresh
Rogue One certainly doesn't hit all its marks. But it surely hits enough to keep holiday audiences happy, particularly as its story begins to merge with the one we discovered all those years ago.|Fresh
It works more than it doesn't, and the story itself feels fresher than Force Awakens because it isn't a repeat of a previous Star Wars movie.|Fresh
This is meant to be a standalone spin-off from the Star Wars movie universe, but it feels like Episode 3.5.|Fresh
... a reason to hit theaters this holiday season.|Fresh
... the film is mostly a triumph - heavy on the action, light on the romance, and one of the best heroines to come out of the big screen in 2016.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story sets the benchmark of how a good standalone film can be made without ruining a tight story with unnecessary sequels.|Fresh
While Rogue One: A Star Wars Story does not bring the excitement of the surprising, original 1977 Star Wars (almost 40 years ago!), it does offer many similar pleasures.|Fresh
Rogue One captures and develops the epic yearning and philosophical difficulty of the original series' DNA.|Fresh
Ultimately, Rogue One is a movie for Star Wars fans.|Fresh
What ought to be a raging call for rebellion sputters and coughs and then finally lapses into stupefied incoherence.|Rotten
Luckily, this is a film so rooted in the archetypal heroic quest that everyone can enjoy in varying degrees: hardcore fans, newcomers and young children alike can appreciate the rebels and their fight against the Leviathan|Fresh
A truly stand-alone Star Wars film is worth waiting for. But a prequel this good is a first for Star Wars, too.|Fresh
There's a certain weight here that hasn't necessarily been present in most of the other films. And that, plus the film's talented, diverse cast, makes Rogue One a truly unique twist on the familiar format.|Fresh
Rogue One is not about people who get a medal and a kiss from the princess. Rogue One is a war film. And it's very, very good.|Fresh
Rogue One starts wearing out its welcome at about the hour mark, and there's another 75 minutes to go; the movie, lumbering like those AT-ATs, feels like it stomps along forever.|Rotten
This is a slightly darker shade of Star Wars adventure, for better and for worse. But it's also a refreshingly diverse collection of heroes this time, a multi-cultural crew against a white supremacist dictatorship.|Fresh
Hopping from planet to planet, battle to battle, the fast-paced narrative means there's little time to flesh out everyone involved. Yet even if their characters remain sketchy, several make vivid impressions... [Tudyk's K-2SO] is a scene-stealing delight.|Fresh
...for those of us who remember the prequel DVDs being events unto themselves, the overall package is a letdown.|Rotten
It emphasizes the necessity of sacrifice for victory, and celebrates the anonymous, forgotten fighters who put it all on the line before that Skywalker kid even got up to bat.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has gorgeous visuals, including an excellent production design and great special effects, but when it comes to the narrative, there's a lot left to be desired thanks to a screenplay that refuses to develop the characters.|Rotten
More proof that diverse casts can actually lead to big box office numbers.|Fresh
Despite its insubstantial characters, Rogue One is an interesting entry in the Star Wars franchise, and the flawless A/V transfer of Disney's Blu-ray fully translates its aesthetic beauty.|Fresh
Not all Star Wars fans will embrace Rogue One. In so many ways, though, it does fit the tenor of our time.|Fresh
Did I love it? Not really. But I liked it just fine. It needed it to be much better than those best-forgotten Episodes I-III, and it does just that.|Fresh
It's a movie that nails what it means to be Star Wars in seemingly every way, and it's not afraid to scare the bejeezus out of a few kids to get there.|Fresh
An origin story that stays true to its predecessors while crafting its own unique identity.|Fresh
Everyone gasped, shouted, and laughed throughout the film, culminating in a well-deserved, thunderous applause to one of the best films of this franchise and 2016. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A hugely entertaining film in which all of the elements fall into place so seamlessly that it can't help but make the vast majority of recent would-be blockbusters look even lamer than they already do.|Fresh
Disney brilliantly executed another film in the Star Wars franchise, easing the doubts of fans and furthering our expectations on what we can expect from the films to follow.|Fresh
Edwards reminds us of the real reasons we love these movies. Rogue One gives us hope in Star Wars. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In the first 'Star Wars' film, in 1977, heroism is rewarded (literally, in the form of a medal); but here, heroism requires extreme sacrifice. That (ultimately lethal) distinction is a key to the difference between previous chapters and this sidebar...|Fresh
As the lost piece of an intricate puzzle, Rogue One satisfyingly presses into its rightful place in the series' universe. Filling in that blank space might never have seemed necessary, but, once you've seen it, there's no denying the richness added.|Fresh
"Though it's certainly worth a look, ""Rogue One"" is a minor ""Star Wars"" story."|Fresh
A deep cut for Star Wars fanatics,|Fresh
"This latest ""origin story"" features no storytelling development but simply repeats Star Wars formulae...Rogue One, a huckster's tale, confirms the Disney Corporation's routine indoctrination of its captive audience."|Rotten
Fans of the Star Wars films--and don't be ashamed to admit it if you are one-- will see a more complete expansion of the mainline story and a lot of visual excitement.|Fresh
Since Rogue One slides neatly into the preexisting plot of the original Star Wars trilogy, it doesn't feel glaringly imitative of it, as The Force Awakens did.|Fresh
A thrifty footnote in the Star Wars saga.|Rotten
Rogue One is fine (if you're a Star Wars fan).|Fresh
Technically sophisticated and emotionally engaging.|Fresh
It's all action, hopping from planet to planet and blasting all the way. That makes it faster and more serious than anything in the series.|Fresh
For a sublime third act, Rogue One is a resounding success. For the perversity of slavish desire for performers to be as interchangeable as video game characters, this Star Wars dude does not abide.|Fresh
This is a Star Wars film for fans, not casual observers. It has plenty of nice touches that bring back fond memories of the original and may well be the best Star Wars films since the original trilogy.|Fresh
The first act is the frenetic embodiment of the Hollywood machine, but the final 30 minutes is a rousing climactic battle on the empire's home turf.|Fresh
It's already apparent that Disney's plans for Star Wars are cause for excitement.|Fresh
Rogue One isn't taking any chances: It's desperate to ensure a seamless transition with Episode IV, as if this constitutes a meaningful end in itself.|Rotten
Yes!!!|Fresh
Apart from Ben Mendelsohn's weaselly Orson Krennic [and perhaps Donnie Yen]... the faces are unmemorable and the characters unexceptional, their meaningful glances unearned.|Rotten
There's weight to this world, no longer defined by clashes between politicians and spiritual warriors; instead, there's a sense of the desperation of the people and creatures that have always existed just outside the margins of the series' frame.|Fresh
Starts off slow, but boasts a fantastic third act and a very satisfying ending. A worthy addition to the Star Wars canon (Splice Today)|Fresh
An exciting film full of heroism and redemption, that has great action scenes and political intrigues and achieves several touching moments. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's pretty routine, but Star Wars faithful should find it plenty good enough; director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving well enough for the modest needs of the script.|Fresh
When Rogue One is good, it is VERY good. When it is bad, it is... well not prequel trilogy-bad, at least.|Fresh
"An original story about ""ordinary beings achieving extraordinary things"" that only exists in science fiction, without jedis and Skywalker. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
A film that is embedded throughout the saga as a beautiful appendix, at times awkward, but finally satisfying. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Star Wars expanded universe kicks off with this entertaining yet far from flawless prequel to A New Hope...|Fresh
While there is some humor in the movie, I would have liked more of that and less of the several scenes featuring characters stoically waiting to die. I can't really blame them for their fatalistic outlook since the Empire is indestructible.|Fresh
The first 'Star Wars Story' is a success.|Fresh
Those with patience will find that its second half is fully rewarding, with its epic battles and grand conflicts between good and evil bearing most of the weight of the astronomical expectations that are now part and parcel of the franchise.|Fresh
Earns its intergalactic stripes as a Star Wars spin-off of visual gumption and gritty action filmmaking, securing its place as the glue between trilogies in this ever-expanding space saga.|Fresh
... makes many of the other Star Wars films feel inferior - can we postpone the numbered movies and just tell these little big stories for a while?|Fresh
Really, this is the prequel that should have been made 10 years ago instead of that dreck that George Lucas defecated into the world.|Fresh
Rogue One slots satisfyingly into the canon, pushing the franchise in a slightly more edgy, contemporary direction without causing a disturbance in the Force.|Fresh
While Rogue One isn't as grand or consequential as The Force Awakens, it finds space in the margins to leave a mark all its own.|Fresh
"A unique and superb ""Star Wars"" adventure..."|Fresh
[Rogue One] might not be as grand a space opera as its predecessors, but certainly holds its own.|Fresh
A film that is only worth if you're a big fan of the universe created by George Lucas. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Jones, Mendelsohn and Forest Whitaker (as a militia leader) stand out in a strong cast.|Fresh
A routine CGI extravaganza primarily interested in creating a Pavlovian response every time someone or something familiar appears.|Rotten
"A film that gives a new value to the term ""prequel"" in this universe, in addition to ""fanservice"", which is done in favor of a solid and exciting script. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Disney may be squeezing the franchise to the fullest, but as long as it continues to produce Star Wars movies of this quality, I doubt many people will complain. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
You never knew Donnie Yen whomping stormtroopers was something you needed in your life until you saw it happening.|Fresh
These Star Wars movies are pretty much the same story each time nowadays. This one has new names for basically the same characters, played by different actors...the same bad guys. How many times can they make the same movie and get people to pay?|Rotten
While Rogue One never comes close to matching the heights of the series at its most dazzling (basically, Episodes IV and V, with honorable mention to Episode VII), it's still a worthy addition to the canon.|Fresh
Not just a dull but an oppressive experience, being force-fed a corporate product: a film that never comes alive, with none of the characters properly developed, none of the relationships gelling, the very adventure formulaic.|Rotten
A cleverly conceived one-off that forges its own identity with a new set of characters, a contained storyline and a kind of stripped-down tone and visual approach free of the grandiosity of the series.|Fresh
Edwards appears to have elevated what could have been simply a cash-in into something that feels essential, even magical. It has the distinct smell of victory.|Fresh
It's most distinctive as a stylistic departure from the original Star Wars template.|Fresh
"Rousing ""Rogue One"" a worthy entry in the ""Star Wars"" saga."|Fresh
A well-crafted and thoughtful story drives Rogue One - in a sandbox that provides a perfect blend of modern action and classic Star Wars style.|Fresh
A shot in the arm of apathy, a timely Christmas fantasy, proof of a fully-rejuvenated franchise.|Fresh
This Star Wars film is functional, has strength and in one way or another contributes to the cause. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story meets expectations, the fears of thousands of fans can dissipate, this is a worthy product. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"In addition to giving us exactly what we should expect from our blockbuster event-movies, ""Rogue One"" means we've only just begun to explore this galaxy far, far away."|Fresh
The stars are gone, much of the spirit has been lost, leaving only a lot more wars. So this is a space-faring, big-screen computer game with hoards of Stormtroopers.|Fresh
Even if it's not great, it is a quality sci-fi film that won't disappoint its fan base.|Fresh
It's a giant universe out there, but in these movies it just keeps getting smaller.|Rotten
Explosive action, interesting characters and a compelling story make this stand-alone movie in the Star Wars universe a winner all the way.|Fresh
Fans will be happy.|Fresh
Rogue One is at its best when it explores the relationship between the characters at ground level. They are a scrappy lot with a lot of heart.|Fresh
These disparate elements do not come together to make a cohesive whole. At times, Rogue One feels like a rehash of previous Star Wars films, only with newer faces.|Rotten
Jyn represents a new breed of (almost gender-neutral) hero: dogged, tenacious, resolute. And in a world as bleak as this one, that's what amounts to hope.|Fresh
Its characters are largely new, which means the movie can do with them as it wants. It isn't hemmed in the way most prequels are.|Fresh
Rogue One does a brilliant job capturing the look and feel of Star Wars, but narratively, it's a footnote, and some of the creative choices are baffling.|Rotten
Much of Rogue One is a push-me pull-you with George Lucas' original films.|Fresh
Rogue One feels more like a movie with Star Wars stuff in it than an actual Star Wars movie.|Rotten
Rogue One is set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, yet feels more immediate, even prescient, than any Hollywood film in recent memory.|Fresh
Rogue one is the Star Wars film, that as an adult (who grew up with the originals), I've always wanted to see. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a film that remains fun thanks to its rich universe, spectacular set pieces and superb supporting cast, while still being held back from achieving the same excellence as its predecessor.|Fresh
Rogue One sure pulls no punches and it is a gritty war picture that perfectly captures a galaxy ruled and impoverished by the tyranny of the cold and clinical Empire.|Fresh
Let's get this out of the way -- Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.|Fresh
Ben Mendelsohn is satisfyingly nasty as the film's principal villain, and while I'd like to have seen a little more of Mads Mikkelsen, an ensemble cast of proper actors gives the film authenticity, and grit.|Fresh
...an attempt to squeeze one more movie out of a used MacGuffin.|Rotten
I believe devoted Star Wars fans will be thrilled with the intense Rogue One. I liked it okay.|Fresh
The studios announced that Rogue One will be a stand-alone affair without any sequels or spin-offs, which is just as well. There's nothing here that's worth carrying into future movies.|Rotten
It ranks among the series' best -- just below A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back (Episodes IV and V), and just above The Force Awakens.|Fresh
From a visual standpoint it's stunning, as the production values are a real knockout. Plus the battle scenes are really well executed. That said the plot is not always that engaging.|Fresh
This off-shoot is a heck of a fun science-fiction film, and the last third of the movie is a wild, epic battle.|Fresh
Suffice it to say, if the filmmakers had actually put up this tangle of a screenplay to K-2SO to rate his opinion, it wouldn't have been encouraging.|Rotten
As rousing as it is respectful, carving out its own path while playing within the boundaries of the previous blockbusters, this is one of the best Star Wars stories ever put to film|Fresh
"Maybe its modesty is the key to the success of ""Rogue One,"" that it doesn't seek to build on the mythology of the other seven films, but simply fill in a gap."|Fresh
Epic but violent adventure offers diversity, role models.|Fresh
The 2:13 length and cookie cutter characters and events suck the life out of an underwhelming story. Great effects but the Force just isn't with this one.|Rotten
This standalone prequel/sequel takes a few beats to get going but once it does, Star Wars fans are taken on an intense, thrilling ride.|Fresh
Trading emotion and depth for sci-fi magic and bombast, Rogue One is the start of a darker, more grown-up direction for the saga, and I applaud it.|Fresh
There's genuine fun here, but the humor is cynical, the heroics are tinged with regret, and it's all delivered with a cold smack of - yes - political relevance.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is thrilling, harrowing, and slightly rushed, a beautifully shot film that could have given its characters more time to develop.|Fresh
If you've ever wondered where Princess Leia got those Death Star plans from, well, here you go. Hope I'm not spoiling anything.|Rotten
The best Star Wars movie ever by a longshot.|Fresh
I had a bad feeling about this, but Rogue One proves it belongs in the Star Wars universe.|Fresh
Stylistic touches and new characters make 'Rogue One' seem fresh, which also invigorates the ongoing franchise.|Fresh
We must trust this series, a series that made us fall in love with scruffy-looking nerf herders, trigger happy fuzzballs and pessimistic droids. We must trust the Force.|Fresh
"By the note-perfect closing moments, ""Rogue One"" has transformed into a richly rewarding experience."|Fresh
As we rebels prepare to fight the empire of Trump, the film is more pertinent than ever.|Fresh
"The Force is with ""Rogue One"" because by looking back, it helps carry the ""Star Wars"" saga forward."|Fresh
Rogue One is technically a spin-off but it is a rip-roaring, do-or-die adventure yarn in the best tradition of the space-age saga.|Fresh
Gareth Edwards has expanded his story to its maximum while keeping it lean, raw and morally murky, outdoing The Force Awakens in the most satisfying installment since The Empire Strikes Back.|Fresh
A seriously rousing action film with a riveting cast of characters and a surprising willingness to embrace even the darkest elements of storytelling.|Fresh
With strong work from Jones, Luna, Mikkelsen and Mendelsohn, a handful of exciting set-pieces... and plenty of expensive CG (surprise, surprise), this still doesn't quite work as the epic it so wants to be.|Rotten
There's a sense of familiarity and a refreshing sense of being offered something we haven't quite seen before, and that Rogue One is actually entertaining about it makes the experience all the sweeter.|Fresh
The film isn't as excting as Episode VII, but there are a few reasons to get excited about it: the incredible stages, Death troopers and a pair of cameos that serve as anchor to this universe. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With amazing battles that live up to the original saga, this film is more than a close relative worthy of Star Wars. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As a prequel, it brings depth and strength to the existing canon, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will probably leave fans wishing it could have spun off into a franchise of its own.|Fresh
It's a film that should further the genuine sense of excitement surrounding this particular franchise revival, while standing as something of a classic in its own right.|Fresh
The Force is strong in this spin-off.|Fresh
Rogue Ones establishes its own identity while fitting perfectly in the Star Wars universe. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
We're used to the characters in this series existing primarily as archetypes. The characters here, though, barely qualify as archetypes.|Rotten
This is the Star Wars film to be excited for since a galaxy far, far away has never looked as promising as it does now. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is everything The Force Awakens should have been and then some.|Fresh
Certainly there is pleasure in revisiting a favorite place you've been many times before. But it's not an 'event' film. For the first time, it really does just feel like an episode.|Fresh
Rogue One finds a way to forge its own path.|Fresh
A film with amazing performances and an absolutely memorable ending, where action, emotion, joy and sadness embrace in a totemic spectacle. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Gareth Edwards'] technical vision shines through in the battle scenes, but his work with actors leaves something to be desired|Fresh
[A]n eye-popping heart-stopping joyride that leaves you breathless... a grand and operatic vision...|Fresh
Edwards pushes the saga out of its comfort zone to offer a complex look at the universe created by George Lucas, making it truly feel diverse and complicated. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sadly, that Felicity Jones isn't a standout as Rogue One's lead speaks to how more effort seems to have been spent on fan service than character development...|Fresh
A fun ride that repeats the Star Wars legacy without really adding to it.|Fresh
It's an enthralling go, with little pops of surprise and revelation that should please, nostalgically so.|Fresh
An energetic and very surprising film from the galactic saga with the very successful and simple resource of telling the same story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Rogue One may be more intense than fun, but it's the best Star Wars prequel film by a long shot.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is what the fans expected and more. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A serious and occasionally spectacular addition to the Star Wars universe that only suffers in comparison to the original saga when measured by the charisma and likability of its characters.|Fresh
Action-packed and glorious in its engaging and often times, exotic dimensions of storytelling is absolutely stirring.|Fresh
This is a movie made for fans.|Fresh
Tudyk's K-2S0 has in miniature what Edwards's movie lacks overall: the soul of a new machine.|Rotten
Star Wars Wars is such an immersive world heavy in lore and esoteric facts that being able to balance fan service without scaring off the casual moviegoer is no easy feat. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story manages to do exactly that.|Fresh
It's a real shame the character side of things is so weak, because otherwise this is a strong addition to the franchise.|Fresh
Some sci-fi/fantasy fans may wonder if every last drop has already been milked out of the Star Wars franchise. But, judging from this energetic standalone tangent/prequel, more can be exploited for many years to come.|Fresh
[K-2SO] has all the good lines. I'm not sure if it's such a good thing that the best character in a sci-fi movie is a robot. But then again, the best character in 2001: A Space Odyssey was HAL, and that film wasn't half-bad.|Fresh
Except for a few jocose, fan-serving moments, the movie is a dour affair, lacking the charm and chills of J.J. Abrams's spirited Star Wars: The Force Awakens, not to mention George Lucas's founding trilogy.|Rotten
Like an Imperial Star Destroyer, it starts off slow and somewhat clunky, but by the time the mind-blowing third act arrives, it's all a fan can do not to stand up and cheer.|Fresh
Often it looks dingy and cheap. Speed of action ought to compensate. But when the action is standardised chases-through-space, turgid and repetitive, that doesn't compensate for anything.|Rotten
[Rogue One] is sometimes as admirable as it is enjoyable, but it also has some glaring problems that are clearly holding the movie back from reaching its full potential.|Fresh
This prequel delivers more levels than the Death Star's elevator.|Fresh
One of the most exhilarating in the series, a film with a real sense of how to tell a story - and tell it well.|Fresh
Familiar Star Wars action scenarios are revisited, revamped and revitalised courtesy of bleeding edge effects and genuine love for the material.|Fresh
Rogue One does a great job of walking the fine line between being a Star Wars film and not feeling like any other Star Wars film.|Fresh
A highly entertaining mess...the kind of loopy, stumblebum spectacle you get when state-of-the-art visual effects collide head-on with the erratic sensibilities of a resolutely mediocre director and the crushing need for a studio to meet a release date.|Fresh
The rebel yell is a little croaky.|Fresh
It also works as its own stand-alone film. One which, despite some lumpy pacing in its first half, turns out to be possibly the best Star Wars war film of the bunch.|Fresh
Rogue One works best because its story is so narrowly focused.|Fresh
Rogue One is an explosive, brilliant entry into the Star Wars universe. It's a bracing slap in the face, but a bloody fun one to watch.|Fresh
The good news is that it's something genuinely fresh, a Star Wars story unlike any big screen adventure yet.|Fresh
In short, this movie is what the Star Wars prequels should have been, and that's meant as high praise indeed.|Fresh
The resonant and entertaining Rogue One is about the persistence of hope and faith in the darkest of hours. As we stagger to the end of this epically turbulent year, the movie is all but guaranteed to strike a chord.|Fresh
Efficiently made...but it comes across as an assembly-line product, an elaborate but fairly conventional action-adventure movie too dependent for its effect on references to earlier entries in the series.|Rotten
That's what people love about these Star Wars movies, right? We get older, they stay the same.|Fresh
Rogue One packs an emotional punch and shows much promise for stories to come from a rich universe with an astonishing cultural impact.|Fresh
Dark, gritty and heavy on the nostalgia, what Rogue One lacks in dialogue it makes up for in action.|Fresh
a boots-on-the-ground war story about flawed and forgotten heroes|Fresh
The performances in this film are among the best the franchise has seen. This isn't a film of supermen. It's one of everyday people trying to justify, morally and practically, their roles in the struggles against an overwhelming, evil adversary.|Fresh
The film comes home strong, with large-scale warfare, feats of great daring and sacrifice, and acres of dead storm-troopers.|Fresh
I enjoyed the film that nicely balances being its own standalone offering and one that pays homage to and serves as an important thread in the sci-fi series. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Stuff, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Rogue One is entertaining enough, but there is not much surprise as to how things turn out.|Fresh
Hemmed in by a script that assigns truly theatrical sinisterness to pre-existing creations (i.e. Darth Vader) Ben Mendelsohn doesn't get to go 'the full Mendo', filled with pure, baleful, blackhearted menace, but hot damn - it's good to have him on board.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is what the fans were waiting for. Ideal for the ones that aren't passionate about the saga because they will find reasons to fall in love with this universe. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Above all else, it is on a technical level that Rogue One truly excels, allowing Edwards to conjure a sizeable number of intergalactic spectacles that are as stirring as they are stylish.|Fresh
"Imitation, they say, is the highest form of flattery. If so, the makers of ""Rogue One"" flatter the heck out of its predecessors."|Fresh
Gareth Edwards tries to generate suspense by using well-worn movie cliches that display a lack of imagination and point to the flaws of telling this tale in the first place.|Fresh
Rogue One is still an achievement. Every other Star Wars movie has only ever had the responsibility of telling part of a story - this manages the whole thing in one go.|Fresh
A fun outing, if also a derivative one. Donnie Yen and the droid steal the film from the leads...|Fresh
There's a comfort in being in the Star Wars Universe and you immediately feel a renewed affection for it upon re-entry. But a Star Wars film shouldn't rely on its Star Wars-yness.|Rotten
Rogue One does not extend the Star Wars story but there are times when it deepens it.|Fresh
The story clicks nicely into place with the events of Star Wars but that narrative is really just a blank sky in which the film's other elements can sparkle like stars.|Fresh
Rogue One might not necessarily be a film that was needed but once the credits roll, you realise how much you desperately wanted it regardless.|Fresh
Nothing is exultant, dramatic, epic, heroic, complex or just entertaining to me. The film is overwhelmingly empty, and lacks minimal grace and rhythm. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Rogue One is one of the best films of our favorite space saga and will undoubtedly delight the fans, even on the verge of a nostalgic and involuntary tear of emotion. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Rogue One is like its heroes. It is flawed in some ways, but it's still well worth the wait.|Fresh
It suffers, like many blockbusters, from too much spectacle and not enough truth, but its greatest sin is that it feels dull, insipid and underwhelming despite a plethora of loud action scenes and dazzling visual effects.|Rotten
enhances as well as annotates the Star Wars mythos, making the story we thought we knew in A NEW HOPE richer and more urgent.|Fresh
In previous Star Wars movies, one side wore black hats and the other wore white...Here that's not the case. For some, this is a selling point. For me, it's close to a deal-breaker.|Rotten
There's nothing to sink our teeth into, especially when we already know how it ends. There's no suspense.|Rotten
Rogue One is at its best when it's at war .|Fresh
Admittedly, this can be viewed as simply another rehash of old stories and themes, but hash is rarely this tasty.|Fresh
A Star Wars story for the ages.|Fresh
The movie the prequels should have been. Perfectly captures the spirit of the original trilogy and delivers a genuinely thrilling Star Wars film.|Fresh
Rogue One is Star Wars for hard core fans who felt left behind by the prequels, but it's got little to offer casual viewers beyond competent, uninspired thrills.|Fresh
Of space dust, Joni Mitchell and the Force: a visually splendid, dramatically stirring journey spanning both yesteryear and tomorrow.|Fresh
The Force is not only well and truly with us again, it seems as if it's never been gone.|Fresh
An almighty triumph, the best-constructed and most fun Star Wars flick since The Empire Strikes Back. The force is truly strong with this one.|Fresh
It was always one of 2016's most anticipated films and it doesn't let down the legions who have been waiting for it.|Fresh
Gareth Edwards has crafted the most satisfying Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.|Fresh
The movie didn't rekindle the thrill of seeing, say, The Empire Strikes Back, but Rogue One will loom pretty large in the Star Wars galaxy - if only because there's so little competition.|Fresh
While the principal characters are new, Edwards ensures there are enough significant nods to the Star Wars universe to enchant fans.|Fresh
A movie experience that is supremely captivating.|Fresh
Jones' portrayal is quite different from what we have come to expect from the Oscar nominee, and she proves she can handle the role of an action heroine with surprising ferocity.|Fresh
"""...has the urgency and battlefield heroism that great war movies are made of. It's incredible stuff all around."""|Fresh
"""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a fine stand-alone film and one that will have you anticipating ""Episode VIII,"" which is just a short 367 days away!"|Fresh
ROGUE ONE begins as an inspired concept, only to conclude with a soulless stare.|Rotten
Coming from someone who is not really a Star Wars freak, I have to say I was impressed. This could be the best one yet.|Fresh
There is always the danger with a film of this high profile to expect or want it to over-deliver. Sadly - though understandably - Rogue One just doesn't do that.|Fresh
Rogue One accomplishes what fans have wanted to see for a few decades now: making Darth Vader scary again.|Fresh
It's the trio of Tudyk, Wen and especially Yen who steal the show, each bringing to life characters that will likely go down as three of the best ever to grace a story set in the Star Wars universe.|Fresh
This is a gorgeous and immersive film.|Fresh
Though not meant to be an episode in the great intergalactic narrative of the series of trilogies, Edwards' Rogue One is an enthralling companion piece that fully embodies the Star Wars spirit and delivers the rousing pleasures.|Fresh
Technically brilliant, Rogue One delivers the spectacle and the aerial combat that are such signatures of the Star Wars ethos, with some eye pleasing vistas of a hectic part of the stunningly beautiful universe|Fresh
New diverse actors from around our world breathe new life into prequel that just entertainingly barely satisfactorily, repeats the tried and true themes and expensive action.|Fresh
This spin-off/prequel has the same primitive, lived-in, emotional, loopy, let's-put-on-a-show spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy.|Fresh
Of the three sidekicks, Yen's rueful but deadly martial artist leaves the best action impression.|Fresh
Rogue One somehow delivers on almost all of its weighty pre-release promises whilst at the same time besting The Force Awakens for sheer spectacle.|Fresh
A hugely enjoyable film, and an impressive sign of things to come. This is the perfect film for a Star Wars fan.|Fresh
"It's an experiment that mostly works, but there are moments when it's clear that the task of finding new areas of ""Star Wars"" to play with is a bit too much for director Gareth Edwards to handle."|Fresh
We already knew this was going to be a thrilling epic, but I had no idea of the emotional punch it would pack.|Fresh
I enjoyed this scrappy little movie, the second consecutive one to feature a female heroine.|Fresh
Rogue One left me feeling giddy with joy at seeing the Star Wars franchise expanded with such a genuine sense of affection and understanding for what made us fall in love with a galaxy far, far away.|Fresh
It offers more details of interoffice politics among the squabbling factions of both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance than probably anyone but a mid-level manager cares for. Yet you generally feel you're in good hands.|Fresh
"Star Wars movies have been dazzling, infuriating, heartbreaking, silly, witty, convoluted, gripping and overblown. But until Rogue One: A Star Wars story, I don't think ""dull"" was the most appropriate adjective."|Rotten
[Rogue One has] well-placed humor, inside jokes, aliens, droids and creepy CGI renderings of two key Star Wars characters, all set against the backdrops of mind-bending production designs and hypnotic visual effects.|Fresh
It's a downer. It's morally tangled. The characters are as depressed as the scenario, and Michael Giacchino's music can't make it better.|Rotten
Disney refuses to waver from what makes 'Star Wars' matter - the battle between good and evil. Where can we send the 'thank you' notes?|Fresh
If you're not a fan, Rogue One may not be the revelation that The Force Awakens turned out to be. But it won't have you wishing for your own personal Death Star either.|Fresh
...while it's great to see Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen placed into Star Wars lore as a catalyst for the Rebel Alliance the British Jones lacks the fire Daisy Ridley brought to Chapter VII.|Fresh
Lucasfilm has outdone themselves. They've delivered a thrilling installment that embodies the best of Star Wars. Rogue One surpasses every expectation.|Fresh
The most thrilling Star Wars experience yet.|Fresh
What results is a poignant, powerful paean to the Star Wars Universe, set in a world where the best thing you can hope for is hope itself. It's a perfect and complete standalone, but it changes everything.|Fresh
If The Force Awakens was an exercise in giving Star Wars fans exactly what they want, Rogue One does its best to show them what else there is in the galaxy.|Fresh
Credit to Jones, then, for imbuing the character with a steely melancholy. Moreover, her chemistry with bad-boy Andor visibly sizzles, so that you feel genuine investment in their story.|Fresh
The new characters are nicely fleshed out, particularly Jones's Jyn, whose initial cynicism gradually morphs into a steely resolve, its seed planted by the memory of her father, but watered by the idealism of the Rebellion.|Fresh
A classic adventure story and worthy spin off of one of the most popular sagas of contemporary cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
At its best, Rogue One is scrappy and epic in equal measure, aware of the potential to be glorified fan fiction and using exactly what it needs from the Star Wars mythology to create a vibrant, stand-alone adventure.|Fresh
"""Rogue One"" is definitive proof: ""Star Wars"" is back, baby."|Fresh
When you realize where it's all been heading -- ending on a moment that's as transcendent as anything in 40 years of the franchise -- you'll be so, so happy.|Fresh
Rogue One is one of the best Star Wars flicks to date -- as well as the grittiest, darkest, and most grounded.|Fresh
Rogue One features stirring action scenes, vivid characterisation and one or two truly eye-popping explosions. Nonetheless, what it lacks is any real originality.|Fresh
"Doesn't break the mold in terms of franchise formula, and it's an enjoyable installment in the ""Star Wars"" canon. However, it's not much more than that."|Fresh
'Because it's awesome' is enough reason for Rogue One, and it is awesome. The final space battle is the best space battle of any Star Wars movie.|Fresh
Much more than a mere sideshow in the Star Wars saga, these rebels build on a brilliant legacy.|Fresh
Star Wars has been filled with political commentary since the first in 1977, and this film is no different. [...] I enjoyed this more than The Force Awakens.|Fresh
"As the kickoff of a new phase of ""Star Wars"" on the big screen, ""Rogue One"" is a smashing success, showing there is a lot more to this galaxy than lightsabers and Skywalkers."|Fresh
A perfectly satisfying summer fun film. Untidy and a little clich at first, but eventually ends up standing out because of its humor and its subversive energy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Rogue One"" is pure, unbridled ""Star Wars."""|Fresh
For all that feels uninspired and unnecessary in Rogue One, it's no disaster.|Fresh
Gareth Edwards' venture into a galaxy far, far away is the Star Wars film we never knew we needed. It's a triumphantly thrilling, serious-minded war movie that is incalculably stronger for the fact that it's NOT the first chapter in a new franchise.|Fresh
Rogue One is a bright light in the Star Wars canon.|Fresh
Edwards has created the rare Star Wars property that can be appreciated as a film. And it is about as violent and downbeat as Star Wars gets on the big screen-more downbeat than The Empire Strikes Back, in fact.|Fresh
Let's face it: Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie in a long, long time. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Towering like a stick-man over the rest of the cast, K-2SO provides most of the laughs in this portentous voyage into that same old galaxy far, far away.|Fresh
Rogue One, directed by Gareth Edwards with a sharp script by Tony Gilroy and Chris Weitz, is a bracing and dizzying marvel, propulsively pitched and even, I dare say, moving.|Fresh
In the end, this hardening of the franchise seems likely to alienate both the fans and the uninitiated.|Rotten
A more than worthy adventure but lacks the brilliance of the original trilogy. It makes us have a good time, but not a memorable one. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
In between all the crash bang and wallop, there are also some truly odious villains, with Vader as sinister as he's ever been and Australia's Ben Mendelsohn clearly relishing his role as the human-cyborg's psychotic chief enforcer.|Fresh
The movie works even if you only have a passing knowledge of the Star Wars universe or haven't seen the original in years. But there are several enjoyable callbacks and some eye-popping surprises for die-hard fans.|Fresh
The Force is strong with this film -- a perfect fit as a prequel to A New Hope.|Fresh
"""Rogue One"" represents an unobjectionable exercise in franchise extension. It's fine. It'll do. For now."|Fresh
"Even though the film is much grungier and more realistic than all the previous chapters, this corner of the ""Star Wars"" universe still is a thrilling place to visit."|Fresh
"The movie has a completely different, more sophisticated feel than most recent special effects-driven entries, including last year's so-so ""The Force Awakens."""|Fresh
It's too grimy and relentlessly bleak to be any fun, and lacks the substance and drama to be taken seriously.|Rotten
It tries so hard to be an epic masterpiece - with self-important speeches and an insanely outsize orchestral score - that it ends up a laughable parody of itself.|Rotten
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the best Star Wars movie since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back.|Fresh
A solid film with its own vision and tone, yet undeniably still a part of that wonderful galaxy far, far away.|Fresh
If the franchise can continually pull off blockbusters with the same level of creative energy and the proper amount of reverence as Rogue One does, there's every reason to expect greatness for years to come.|Fresh
If only the two-hour plus runtime made time to dig into its heroes like the original trilogy or The Force Awakens did, Rogue One could have been as sensational and satisfying.|Rotten
For this lived-in universe, Rogue One features some distinctly CGI distractions: revisiting classic characters and resuscitating them 2016-style. It's crude and unnecessary in a film that's otherwise fairly sturdy, if unremarkable.|Fresh
This is exactly what Edwards always said he was going to make - a STAR WARS war film. People die, and tears will be shed. Anyone who thought it would be watered-down should think again.|Fresh
"""Rogue One"" stands on its own, an entry that is at once part of the ""Star Wars"" franchise (obviously) but also separate - a tougher, grittier film."|Fresh
Almost pedantic in its inoffensiveness.|Rotten
All the pieces are there ... like Lego figures in a box. The problem is that the filmmakers haven't really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them.|Rotten
"The action sequences, both on the ground and in space, are rousingly staged. But the losses incurred in those sequences are sobering. The stakes in the ""Star Wars"" rebellion are high indeed."|Fresh
"When the universe ""expands"" in this way, it actually makes it seem so much smaller."|Rotten
It is a brave attempt at making a new kind of Star Wars movie but seems all too eager to express its fealty to the source material without thinking up any ideas of its own.|Rotten
"Intriguing and richly diverse characters, a suspenseful plot, an amusing sidekick, and a very satisfying answer to one of the most persistent questions from ""New Hope."""|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story succeeds far more than it doesn't, and has some rich characters and terrific performances (specifically Tudyk and Yen) to go along with the beautiful visuals and intense action.|Fresh
Rogue One isn't so much a movie as a feature-length promotional film for itself; it's a movie that is still waiting to be made.|Rotten
Rogue One is a bold and stirring adventure film that will have both fans and casual observers spellbound.|Fresh
"It's constant blowing stuff up. Jyn Erso is STAR WARS ""Joan of Arc"" without a zealot's fervor or dynamic leadership presence. She is the only female fighter and all the nomad soldiers blindly follow her. What happened to Mendelsohn's face?"|Rotten
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story does exactly what it is supposed to do by incrementally expanding the Star Wars universe that we already know.|Fresh
Hard-core fans who thought Episode VII was a dumbed-down rehash will bask in an action-packed film that refuses to spoon-feed information. Mind you, that's the same reason why the casual fan will be disengaged.|Fresh
This is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we know by heart. When you think about it, that's pretty exciting. And it opens up a world of cinematic possibilities moving forward.|Fresh
Aside from [K-2SO's] killer lines, wonderfully voiced by the indispensable Alan Tudyk, most big satisfactions in this big, big movie come from references to Star Wars adventures you've loved before.|Fresh
It stands alone as the best Star Wars entry since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. Yes, it's that good.|Fresh
Just once I'd like to see a Star Wars film and be wowed by seeing something completely new and fresh. I didn't hate it, however it commits the crime of being underwhelming and unoriginal.|Rotten
Rogue One is groundbreaking for the Star Wars franchise, a rousing side story that blows the doors wide open for future installments of the series. That it stands on its own as a slam-bam action thrill ride is a bonus.|Fresh
As pure retcon-meets-thought experiment, Rogue One scratches an itch that has been tickling since that initial screening in '77.|Fresh
Rogue One is worthy of standing alongside the original trilogy. Not only in terms of quality, but in creativity, imagination, and inspiration.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story answers the question of whether that galaxy far, far away is big enough to sustain multiple offshoots with an emphatic yes.|Fresh
Contained yet expansive, nostalgic yet new, Rogue One introduces striking heroes and villains and fills its two hours and 13 minutes with a narrative that fits snugly into canon.|Fresh
Rogue One is a more-than-worthy prequel. Which is a first in the Star Wars universe.|Fresh
Rogue One is better than [the prequels] by a long shot, but after the high bar set by last year's Episode VII - The Force Awakens, simply being better than the prequels isn't good enough anymore.|Fresh
"The chaps are heroic. The villains are dastardly. All that's missing is Burton and ""Broadsword calling Danny Boy""."|Fresh
The Force Awakens may have reanimated the once-dormant franchise, but it's Rogue One that will give Star Wars fans a new hope.|Fresh
K-2S0 contributes sorely needed humor, but nowhere near enough.|Rotten
The good news is that Star Wars fans will never want again... but the movies themselves may have gotten a little less special as a result.|Fresh
Despite its darker tone, Rogue One feels cosily at home in the Star Wars universe, and is crowded with the kind of imagination-tickling details the franchise thrives on.|Fresh
Rogue One shouldn't work - from everything from the reshoots to just the fact Star Wars is breaking from centering its story around the Skywalkers - but, yet, it does work. Mostly.|Fresh
Technically deft but emotionally cold.|Fresh
Even an underwhelming Star Wars is a pretty decent Star Wars, but Rogue One misses a real chance to turn the familiar into something remarkable.|Fresh
"Star wars, indeed: The thrilling ""Rogue One"" brings a gritty combat-movie aesthetic to George Lucas's beloved space opera, but not at the expense of a thoughtful, emotional story about the foot soldiers who make sacrifices in the name of a movement."|Fresh
"A little bit ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" a little bit ""Dirty Dozen"" in its mass wartime slaughter, and a pretty good time once it gets going."|Fresh
A more-than-worthy addition to the galaxy far far away.|Fresh
...doesn't move the bar on what it means to be a Star Wars movie in any significant way.|Rotten
A much bolder addition to the franchise that makes risky deviations from the winning formula. That those bold decisions pay off is impressive, most ...well, you know the rest.|Fresh
For all its vivid visual imagination, the film left me almost totally cold. And I say that as a man who has cried actual tears at more than one Star Wars movie.|Rotten
Rogue One is a movie crammed with fan service, but when fan service is done this well, there's little to complain about and much to adore.|Fresh
Very good, and often great... A true cockle-tickler for fans hoping to stoke the excitement of their inner nine-year-olds.|Fresh
A movie that pushes boundaries and takes the kinds of risks this series needs to take in order to evolve to a point where it can tell completely new Star Wars stories featuring characters we've never seen before.|Fresh
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story upends Lucas' familiar saga by zeroing in on the compelling lives outside the orbit of the Skywalkers. There's one word that accurately conveys what this movie does to the Star Wars universe: Rebellion.|Fresh
"A swiftly paced, rough-and-ready entertainment that, in anticipating the canonical events of ""A New Hope,"" manages the tricky feat of seeming at once casually diverting and hugely consequential."|Fresh
The ultimate Star Wars fan film, it's short on whimsy but when it gets going there's enough risk-taking and spectacle to bode well for future standalones.|Fresh
In a series of by-the-bible films, this is the iconoclastic one. And that's its charm.|Fresh
Rogue One manages to succeed as both super-nerdy fan service and the first entry since the 1977 original that will satisfy people who have never seen a Star Wars film.|Fresh
This story isn't going to be like any Star Wars movie you've ever seen.|Fresh
"For the original generation of ""Star Wars"" fans who weren't sure what to make of episodes one, two, and three, ""Rogue One"" is the prequel they've always wanted."|Fresh
It's a flawed movie, but a good one, sometimes more interesting as a concept than a story. But, oh, what a concept!|Fresh
Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.|Fresh
Rogue One might trade heavily in nostalgia but it's bold enough to take risks, and will leave you stirred, fired up and raring for more.|Fresh
Rogue One is a big, crazy video game movie -- but even big, crazy video game movies are allowed to say something.|Fresh
This movie is about the journey, not the destination. And the journey is about as exciting as a long drive down the Florida Turnpike.|Rotten
Rogue One is a return to form and the Star Wars movie fans have been waiting for since the '80s.|Fresh
Despite a galaxy of potential and a number of killer moments, Gareth Edwards' Star Wars spinoff feels painfully forced.|Fresh
I'm recommending it, if only as a three-star action movie. But I think it's important to consider how the original Star Wars movies transcended their pulpy influences and how Rogue One gets mired in them.|Fresh
If nothing else, Gareth Edwards' combative, hard-working installment answers why the Death Star was so easy to destroy in the first place.|Fresh
Its variations on a theme are muscular and adroit. This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack.|Fresh
A punchy standalone action tale about a spunky Rebel Alliance resistance group.|Fresh
This instalment isn't about looking backwards. In essence, it's a war movie and director Gareth Edwards keeps the momentum going with a string of stunning set pieces.|Fresh
Still too reliant on nostalgic fan-service, but a clear step in the right direction for these newfangled 'Star Wars' movies.|Fresh
The Force should have been stronger with this one.|Rotten
The Star Wars franchise has built up a massive amount of cachet over the last several decades; Rogue One is going to need every bit of it.|Rotten
Loaded with more battle action than any of its seven predecessors, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story plays like a set-up for the events in the 1977 original and, for the most part, does so quite entertainingly.|Fresh
Yes, it's part of a series that is now eight movies strong, but it also works alone as a movie about war, oppression, a dangerous heist, a daring rebellion and a spark of hope that ignites the final stages of a revolution.|Fresh
Rogue One is less the fetish object that The Force Awakens is because it at least has the ambitions to create its own character dynamics and plot routes rather than coast on existing ones.|Rotten
Will give die-hard Star Wars fans multiple orgasms...runneth over with Star Wars spectacle.|Fresh
A thrilling, but flawed drama that considers the cost of fighting for one's beliefs.|Fresh
This is more like it...the 'Star Wars' movie J.J. Abrams SHOULD have made.|Fresh
"This ""Star Wars"" spinoff doesn't spin very far off from the franchise, but it's a serviceable stopgap between chapters."|Fresh
Seems to want nothing more than for the audience to pat itself on the back because they know what Yavin 4 is: It's a fun game to play at Comic-Con, but it doesn't make for much of a movie.|Rotten
"Boasts thin characters played by great actors scampering about far too many planets with names that sound like obscure venereal diseases. It's a ""Star Wars"" knockoff that happens to look a lot like a ""Star Wars"" movie."|Rotten
Rogue One builds to one of the best third acts in the entire franchise.|Fresh
Rogue One makes up for a shaky first act by punching into overdrive for an outstanding third act battle sequence that overwhelms in scale and intensity.|Fresh
A darker, grittier Star Wars than we've seen before that suggests, as much as one can, what it was like to discover George Lucas' space opera in the first place.|Fresh
