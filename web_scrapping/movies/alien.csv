"This is a screamingly spooky sci-fi tale with more than a few echoes of ""The Thing"" but echoes which enhance rather than detract."|Fresh
Seen again a quarter-century later, we marvel at how the filmmaker generates so much tension and sweat with a bare minimum of moving parts.|Fresh
The limited strengths of its staple sci-fi horrors always derived from either the offhand organic/ Freudian resonances of its design or the purely (brilliantly) manipulative editing and pacing of its above-average shock quota.|Fresh
The most startling thing watching Alien again is its pacing. For the first 45 minutes, little happens. It's all slow, exquisite build-up, which makes the second half seem all the more horrific.|Fresh
It is depressing to watch an expensive, crafty movie that never soars beyond its cold desire to score the big bucks.|Rotten
The limited strengths of its staple sci-fi horrors always derived from either the offhand organic/ Freudian resonances of its design or the purely (brilliantly) manipulative editing and pacing of its above-average shock quota.|Fresh
Has never looked better or more terrifying. If you're a 4K junkie, this one is most certainly a must-have.|Fresh
This gorgeous, leisurely horror film expresses a spectacularly British xenophobia, a parenthetical nightmare of invasion envisioned between an awakening (at the start of the film) and a return to sleep (at its close).|Fresh
After 40 years, this sci-fi horror masterpiece still feels lethally contemporary.|Fresh
Ridley Scott slowly drains every droplet of hope from his audience as the tension rises in a crescendo, his camera lingering for an age on the crew's desperate faces. Even after multiple watches it remains brutally frightening. (4k restoration)|Fresh
"Everything shrieks fit to burst, ignoring the poster tagline (""In space no one can hear you scream"")."|Fresh
An real classic, that rare case of top cast, top script, top directing, top set and practice effects, everything. In terms of tense sci-fi horrors, it's hard to top Alien.|Fresh
So much of filmmaking is a crapshoot, but every once in awhile, the elements pulled together in front of and behind the camera make for a kind of cinematic alchemy. Alien is one of those instances.|Fresh
Scream all you want-Alien is eternal.|Fresh
Even now, Alien packs a visceral punch...|Fresh
What makes it so effectively terrifying is not an urban legend that could spark an ill-advised, teenage-led hunt nor an array of ominous visuals; it is far simpler than that. It is the thought of finding yourself in Ripley's position.|Fresh
the first part of the movie is essentially Marx in space, and the second part of the movie is Darwin in space.|Fresh
I adore this movie. It's a movie that has engaging characters, an incredible creature, and its incredibly scary. It's one of Ridley Scott's best films.|Fresh
A horror masterpiece that doesn't age at all because its main theme is the fear of the unknown and that's one of the deepest fears. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There have also been digital restorations and improvements to the original film's negative and sound mix, but the best thing about this rerelease is simply the opportunity to see the awesome Alien in theatres again.|Fresh
It's tempting to describe the brilliantly staged scenes of horror and surprise but it would be a shame not to allow the film to reveal its own secrets, enough to say that the tension is savage and you are held in suspense right up to the end frames.|Fresh
A sci-fi thriller of palpable, nerve-tingling tension, with Sigourney Weaver -- playing warrant officer Ellen Ripley -- in stunning form.|Fresh
Bloody brilliant.|Fresh
Still one of the creepiest, scariest, most shocking films ever.|Fresh
it never feels dated and holds up remarkably well.|Fresh
"Director Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is a near masterpiece with many imitators and zero superiors."|Fresh
This 1979 horror-sci-fi masterpiece still holds up remarkably well on the big screen, a testament to the skill of director Ridley Scott.|Fresh
"This revolutionary ""haunted house in space"" thrill-ride is the classic business, stunning you with shock after shock, even when the fascinating monster is exposed in all its hideous glory."|Fresh
If you want cinematic kicks, Ridley Scott's massively successful Alien will give you them in profusion.|Fresh
Look as hard as you like, you won't spot a single flaw, even though the film's had 24 years to date.|Fresh
A perfect roller coaster blend of horror and science fiction. Sigourney Weaver was an amazing discovery.|Fresh
In a century of sci-fi/horror hybrids, few if any movies do such a good job at reaching the absolute highest peaks of both halves of that equation as this one.|Fresh
...a seminal feminist action flick.|Fresh
Alien has power, elicits terror, and the acid blood scars your consciousness.|Fresh
It remains a benchmark of extra-terrestrial horror, and gave us a bona fide A-list star in the shape of Sigourney Weaver.|Fresh
My favorite film of all time is one of the finest blu-rays in my collection.|Fresh
The monster itself is still one of the flat-out scariest ever designed for the movies.|Fresh
Ridley Scott's Alien is nothing short of a masterpiece. Technically brilliant, tense, horrifying and visually breathtaking, there's not a moment in this B-monster movie that doesn't excel well beyond the usual genre trappings.|Fresh
Dated but still extremely scary. Not for younger kids.|Fresh
Science fiction horror doesn't get any better than this.|Fresh
It's a chilling, slow-paced, space horror movie using the same formula as the B-films of the 1950s.|Fresh
Alien proved that material derided as B-movie fodder could be handled with finesse and glossy production values, without diminishing the thrills or polishing over the hard-edged horror.|Fresh
Better than most of today's big budget sci-fi/horror films.|Fresh
It certainly doesn't look like a 24-year-old movie.|Fresh
An old-fashioned scary movie set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, made all the more believable by expert technical craftmanship.|Fresh
There's nothing terribly complex or original about the movie, but it is distinguished by its clever and innovative use of B-movie staples in a hi-tech setting.|Fresh
An empty-headed horror movie with nothing to recommend it beyond the disco-inspired art direction and some handsome, if gimmicky, cinematography.|Rotten
This scary feature breathed new life into the horror genre, launching a length film franchise and introducing to audiences a major actress, Sigourney Weaver, in a tough role typically allotted to men.|Fresh
A movie masterpiece. And on the big screen, the chestburster scene just kills.|Fresh
|Fresh
A wondrous reminder of how imagination can triumph over budget.|Fresh
A genuine fright classic.|Fresh
These things no longer surprise or tantalize us as they once did. In a very short time, science-fiction films have developed their own jargon that's now become a part of the grammar.|Rotten
Alien will upset your mind and upset your stomach.|Fresh
Still one scary mother.|Fresh
...a movie so good, so involving and so jolting that it not only takes is place among the great science fiction films of our time, but also the great thrillers.|Fresh
Ripley, the protagonist of Alien, has more in common with our Puritan ancestors than with us.|Fresh
Alien looks amazing, almost like a new film.|Fresh
This is still a great film and it should be seen on the big screen.|Fresh
Alien is a scare machine that really works.|Fresh
Hoo ha! Twenty-four years later, Alien still kicks some serious butt.|Fresh
One of those rare, timeless movies.|Fresh
This is still the stuff of nightmares.|Fresh
Ridley Scott's new cut won't change the way people think about the movie, but it reinforces the film's strengths without alienating the series' biggest fans.|Fresh
Superbly paced, imaginatively designed, consistently suspenseful and never attracts an unintentional laugh.|Fresh
Ridley Scott's 1979 movie is a great original.|Fresh
Scott can still get me to jump by putting me almost on edge and then throwing me overboard with a small but loud hiss or from something that leaps out of the darkness.|Fresh
|Fresh
It's a most satisfying return to one of the few sci-fi films that deserves to be called a masterpiece.|Fresh
Remains one of the best examples of sustained tension. There is a sense of ominousness, a sense that something bad is going to happen, from the moment the film begins.|Fresh
Besides Weaver and Skeritt, the top-notch ensemble includes two of Britain's best actors -- Ian Holm, as the untrustworthy science officer, and John Hurt.|Fresh
The film remains as gripping today as it was when it was first released in 1979.|Fresh
At the risk of sounding like an old man, they really don't make 'em like this anymore.|Fresh
It's one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.|Fresh
A lot of horror/thriller directors assume that people see a movie for the blood and guts. However, the splatter means nothing if we don't know the characters.|Fresh
Though some of Scott's editing decisions in this new version are questionable -- one even violates continuity -- he has left the film's most suspenseful and chilling moments intact.|Fresh
A beautiful, quiet, and amazingly poetic film visually that lets its shots linger and build a mood of genuine isolation and dread.|Fresh
One of the finest examples of the scary sci-fi genre, with its sequel, Aliens, being the absolute best.|Fresh
What's most unusual about the original 24 years later, though, is its elegant minimalism.|Fresh
...a memorable (yet demonstrably erratic) landmark of the cinematic sci-fi field...|Fresh
It scares us despite our knowing what is coming.|Fresh
The greatest science fiction horror film ever made.|Fresh
Widely imitated but never surpassed.|Fresh
It's all good, and just getting to see this freakin' frightening and visually stimulating flick on a big screen (especially for those who've never seen it in a theater) makes this well worth a trip to your homeworld multiplex.|Fresh
As for the new scenes, most of them don't really add too much. Even more, they aren't going to be all that new to anyone who's watched the wonderful collector's edition DVD that's currently available.|Fresh
The scariest movie in history is actually a bit shy.|Fresh
It's a scream from another era that still echoes around us.|Fresh
A haunted-house movie set in space, Alien also has a profoundly existentialist undertow that makes it feel like a film noir -- the other genre to feature a slithery, sexualized monster as its classic villain.|Fresh
The first half of the film is lyrical and dreamy but when it turns into a nightmare it's cold, dark and eerie.|Fresh
Intriguing, sometimes scary.|Fresh
What makes Alien truly terrifying is Scott's vision of a future where the line between man and machine is disappearing.|Fresh
A crucial film, a unique meld of genuine science-fiction and hardcore horror.|Fresh
(The Director's Cut re-release) doesn't hold up as well as I'd anticipated, (but) the chest-bursting scene is still a seat-gripper.|Fresh
A welcome re-release for Scott's classic sci-fi horror, with a couple of directorial tweaks for good measure.|Fresh
Perfection pure and simple.|Fresh
|Fresh
It still has the power to scare the life out of us.|Fresh
In an era where the horror genre has faded into a laughable mix of teen slashers and formulaic storylines, Alien provides a welcome nostalgic dose of authentic terror.|Fresh
Also welcome is the late-70s distrust of corporate authority, where the mother ship winds up being more duplicitous and evil than the marauding alien.|Fresh
A Claustrophobic spaceship and excellent cast help build layers of atmosphere and dread. The birth of the modern horror/sci-fi genre.|Fresh
Alien remains an impeccably crafted thriller that seems almost as fresh today as it was 24 years ago.|Fresh
|Fresh
Superior science fiction and the best haunted house movie ever made.|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
Scott is canny enough not to let the audience see too much of his monster until the very end. Even then we aren't sure what we've actually seen, except that it's really scary.|Fresh
Where 2001 and Close Encounters suggested that humanity would bring its best impulses and brightest hopes beyond the clouds, Alien served as a reminder that its worst fears would also be part of the package.|Fresh
...more than a hair-raising sci-fi thriller...one of the best horror films ever made.|Fresh
Technically, Scott has consistently demonstrated that he ranks among the best popular film artists. Unfortunately, Scott's film doesn't work for me as well in other areas.|Fresh
Both the Nostromo and the alien world where the alien gets picked up are strange and unforgettably original.|Fresh
The way [Ridley] Scott meticulously raises the sense of menace and tension is worthy of Hitchcock.|Fresh
|Fresh
Alien (1979) is 20th Century Fox's extremely suspenseful, space science-fiction horror film about a menacing, unstoppable,|Fresh
An atmospheric, claustriophobic, slow-moving creep-fest.|Fresh
...a seminal movie in the history of horror...|Fresh
The best recommendation for this film is the multitude of fans that watch this movie time and time again, re-experiencing same, often not so pleasant emotions, yet enjoying the rarely good work of art when they see one.|Fresh
An exercise in pure, raw, unadulterated fear.|Fresh
It delivers a frightening, visionary look at a cold, inhuman future.|Fresh
In space, the famous tagline went, no one can hear you scream. In Alien, you can hear lessons for the sci-fi future in a great milestone from the recent past.|Fresh
