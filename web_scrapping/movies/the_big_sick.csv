The Big Sick takes on some pretty big themes. Luckily, the talent involved both behind the camera and in front of it is able to not only explore those themes, but to incorporate them both honestly and humorously.|Fresh
The Big Sick hits all the right notes at all the right times. It's funny and silly when it needs to be. It's romantic and cute at the right moments. And it sprinkles the drama and realism throughout.|Fresh

There are certain movies that are so intensely personal, so fiercely credible that there's no question they are based on true stories. The Big Sick feels authentic because it is authentic.|Fresh
The Big Sick is one of the most honest, straightforward, quality pieces of American cinema this decade.|Fresh
this is a real American story about cultures clashing and finding a common ground. [Emily] Gordon and [Kumail] Nanjiani's writing shows that we as Americans have many more similarities than we realize; all we have to do is dig deeper.|Fresh

The Big Sick is hilarious, heartbreaking, and heartwarming all at the same time.|Fresh
It may seem like an incredibly simple romantic comedy on paper, but The Big Sick succeeds by avoiding all the usual rom com traps and hones in on the emotional content.|Fresh
It has a strong script that delivers the promised comedy, a rare phenomenon. The characters are relatable and refreshingly unfilmy. Kumail comes through as a writer, as an actor and as a comedian.|Fresh
Movies like The Big Sick don't come around that often.|Fresh
The Big Sick is the kind of film that can cause tears from both joy and pain in the same scene -- a lovely blend of drama and laughs that strikes just the right balance.|Fresh
This movie provided a fresh and different take on that formula that I think many of us were getting burnt out on. It has brilliant writing and storytelling and feels realistic while still being fun and funny.|Fresh
It deals love, death, faith, country, family, friendship and career in a way that's never sentimental, though I defy you to get to the end without shedding a tear.|Fresh
In a very real sense, you'll laugh and you'll cry in equal measure.|Fresh
The Big Sick will open your eyes to a culture many have never witnessed and a couple that is more mainstream than Hollywood would typically care to admit.|Fresh
There is something in that ungainly mixture of gratification and denial that makes The Big Sick work so well in its latter half. If it does not begin on the strongest of legs, it makes sure to have its ending count.|Fresh
Between the stellar cast, likable characters and the engaging script, there is plenty here to like.|Fresh
Isn't just a romantic comedy that defines its genre but a movie that defines the art of screenwriting and what romance stories should be.|Fresh
Happily, The Big Sick makes a welcome recovery from all these potential setbacks to be that rare thing, a genuinely feelgood comedy centred around an absolute bummer of an event.|Fresh
This film is actually one of the year's best so far. If you want to know what budding young relationships look like in America these days, this is the most pleasurable tutorial you'll ever see.|Fresh
Despite the seemingly downer subject matter, The Big Sick is indeed very funny and moving, if slightly bloated.|Fresh
I left The Big Sick feeling charmed, even though I could probably count the amount of times I laughed on one hand.|Fresh
The film's formula is evocative of feelings, without losing the internal tragedy and without trivializing anything. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The ultimate message is that, once we find love, vows are worth both taking and keeping.|Fresh
The Big Sick is that rarest of romantic comedies, in that it's both funny (often hilariously so) and poignant while still allowing its characters to grow and develop despite the constraints of the genre.|Fresh
"It's a pity that ""The Big Sick"" didn't get released in Peruvian theatres; I'm sure people looking for something different, entertaining, intelligent and deeply personal would have enjoyed it. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh

... Kumail's scenes with his parents, his brother and his sister-in-law are the best in the film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A success like The Big Sick really needs to be celebrated, if only to prove that there ARE audiences out there for good, small, well-told stories of love and family, and that the American moviegoing public hasn't completely abandoned quality film.|Fresh
The Big Sick stars Nanjiani as himself (or a version thereof), joined by Zoe Kazan (Ruby Sparks) as Emily. Together they have a genuinely sweet chemistry.|Fresh
The Big Sick is offering hope that comedy isn't dead at the box office.|Fresh
Working with director Michael Showalter and producer Judd Apatow, Nanjiani and Gordon have crafted a deft and appearling film that addresses subjects ranging from cultural change to the unhappy lot of the Uber driver.|Fresh
What The Big Sick ends up accomplishing, is -- in my mind -- perfect romantic comedy.|Fresh
It's a hybridized rom-com that is this summer's winning feature, equal parts funny, cringey, heartwarming and wise (and you might even shed a tear or two).|Fresh
Nanjiani expertly underplays the comedy but the true MVPs are the parents on all sides: Bollywood legend Anupam Kher as Nanjiani's taciturn father and Holly Hunter as Emily's mother.|Fresh
"With its honesty and adroit mix of drama and dark humor, ""The Big Sick"" breathes new life into the commercial contemporary romantic comedy. It's a genuine crowd-pleaser with substance."|Fresh
"It's a joy to watch two ""real people"" (albeit unusually witty, clever and attractive ""real people"") fall in and out and back in love. And, it's particularly satisfying that their mothers have so much to do with it."|Fresh

[The Big Sick] has much humor and love, but not in the doses or formats that you'd expect. Fortunately. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
As far as performances go, Ray and Holly lead the way; Anupam Kher is adept and Kumail with his mostly-comic expressions passes muster.|Fresh
An effortlessly great film is born in the process. This is the best Judd Apatow movie and it wasn't even directed by Apatow|Fresh
... gives us a conciliatory message on the understanding between cultures, in times much in need of them. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There is a real dramatic streak throughout the film, but its real strength lies in being at once uproariously funny and endlessly charming.|Fresh
This multicultural romance succeeds because the filmmakers have avoided the cultural clichés that usually dog the genre.|Fresh
Suddenly, the comatose RomCom has a pulse ...|Fresh
... The Big Sick tells a heart-warming tale of how the couple go through the ups and downs brought about by their cultural differences.|Fresh
Like Apatow's best, it is filled with quirkiness, pathos, drama - there are stakes involved. And the story like real life - and in this case, it was real life - has its ups and downs.|Fresh
The Big Sick is a brilliant film. It's funny and warm, and for anyone who has married across differing cultures, very, very real.|Fresh
The Big Sick signals the arrival of a new prince in the comic kingdom.|Fresh
The acting is very good and the story (co-written by Emily V. Gordon) is highly original. As a bonus, it is based on a true story which is pretty upbeat, even though this edgy movie is less so.|Fresh
There's nothing quite like The Big Sick out there, and particularly in these times, there's nothing like a gentle reminder that even across vast differences in cultural values and beliefs, love can conquer all.|Fresh
The Big Sick proceeds into a palpably puffed-up midsection that's rife with overlong sequences and somewhat needless digressions...|Fresh
A textured, multifaceted example of rom-coms at their very best.|Fresh
Seldom do films achieve the delicate balance of humor and serious commentary. Kudos, then, to The Big Sick, a funny, sweet character study steeped in cultural issues.|Fresh
The Big Sick comes to life just fine. But it's a little unsettling to consider that what might turn out to be the best romantic comedy of the year depends so heavily on a girlfriend in a coma.|Fresh
It's exceedingly amusing in a light, affable register, even as it gets increasingly grey and grim in terms of the emotional states it depicts.|Fresh
Cozy but not cloying; funny without trying too hard.|Fresh
Clearly, The Big Sick has its roots in autobiography -- which, after all, may be the basis of some of our best comedies.|Fresh
The film does push against most of the easy rom-com cliches to deliver a satisfying adult comedy. One value it does share with most American comedies is how its veneer of humour packages a set of values that are chiefly conservative and very American.|Fresh
An intelligent film that offers a blend of real-life material and genre conventions.|Fresh
The Big Sick has a true and beating heart, and it adds up to a sweet and wonderful romance|Fresh
Without overemphasising either the laughs or the emotion, The Big Sick is a romantic comedy that feels genuine.|Fresh
Utterly refreshing, like a big bowl of ice cream after a serving of spicy food.|Fresh
What sets the film apart is an oddness that could only have sprung from real life. That and sincerity, compassion, humanity.|Fresh
Both the script and the direction, from Michael Showalter, move with such pleasing assurance, held aloft by warm currents of banter backstage and at the dinner table, that you don't notice the deceptions that Kumail practises in the name of deference.|Fresh
a film filled with big laughs|Fresh
After a slow start, the film gradually accumulates funny and surprising details, many of them surely drawn directly from life.|Fresh
It may be rather long for a romantic comedy, but this film has such a strikingly original script that it grabs hold and never lets go.|Fresh
The Big Sick gives us a love to aspire to, and when you're dating while sick sometimes you need to be reminded that -- as cheesy as it is -- love conquers all.|Fresh
Very charming and certainly close to the bone.|Fresh
A refreshingly entertaining film with a hell of a lot of heart.|Fresh
The secret sauce flavouring this wonderful movie ... [is that] it's sincere ... This beautiful film will appeal to all, but it is built by grown-ups, and not afraid to wear its intelligence proudly.|Fresh
The Big Sick is so funny and so heartfelt it leaves the audience delighted, while expertly examining romance, relationships and the importance of family.|Fresh
A timeless and timely look at love in all of its complicated forms, The Big Sick also examines parental sacrifice and the immigrant's dilemma of assimilation versus tradition.|Fresh
Nanjiani and Gordon's sharp, intuitive scripting has a lot to say about modern love, age-old prejudices and the simple act of being there for someone who doesn't even know you're there.|Fresh
A very funny and authentic film, with effective drama that gives it weight but doesn't weigh it down.|Fresh
The film's message - that cultures are different but can coexist peacefully - is a welcome one in these riven times.|Fresh
This is the kind of rom-com anyone can get behind - even the manliest of Vin Diesel-watching men - because there's nothing more universal than falling in love.|Fresh
[A] very special movie, and one I was happy to live inside of 124 minutes.|Fresh
At 125 minutes, it's a grind that never finds an equilibrium between feel-good comedy and incisive slice of life. And it's never quite funny enough.|Fresh
Nanjiani is a wonderful screen presence, combining George Clooney good looks with a kind of soft-spoken gormlessness.|Fresh
"Nanjiani and Kazan are joined by a darling supporting cast that includes Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. And yes, the ending will very much leave you with ""all the feels"", as the kids say today."|Fresh
It has moments that are deeply serious, and some that are deeply funny, but it never truly commits to those dramatic peaks and valleys.|Fresh
A comedy with heart and soul to spare.|Fresh
Many films have been made about cross-cultural relationships but The Big Sick will win over most in the audience with its delicately balanced mix of comedy and authenticity.|Fresh
The originality here, though, is in the cultural detail, and the earthy likeability of the two leads.|Fresh
The Big Sick is messy and complex in a fantastic way, exuding a deeply-felt empathy for all its charming characters.|Fresh
The Big Sick is an enchanting film with a terrible title. Don't be put off by it.|Fresh
We're aways off awards season, but it would be an awful pity if The Big Sick wasn't at the business end of things at the start of 2018.|Fresh
These are real characters living real lives, and the humour -- much of it is extremely funny -- is rooted in this reality.|Fresh
A rom-com for people who hate rom-coms. A painfully funny movie, full of enrapturing emotion that captures the glorious contradictions of all kinds of love.|Fresh
Watching this Judd Apatow-produced romcom is like clicking on a for-real YouTube clip of a kitten juggling spoons. Cute. Clever. No wonder The Big Sick has gone viral.|Fresh
Often laugh-out-loud funny, bravely fencing with interracial tensions in post-9/11 America.|Fresh
Donald Trump would surely hate it - and that has to be a good thing.|Fresh
The film is a hoot. It's a hit. It's a smash.|Fresh
This is a touching, refreshing, hilarious and lovely film. See it immediately.|Fresh
Feels so true to the realities of modern relationships that even though it's filled with the sort of bizarre true life scenarios that sound contrived in a movie, it's easy to relate to the complications and dilemmas they generate.|Fresh
The Big Sick is a rom-com that's smarter than most rom-coms, which isn't saying much, admittedly.|Fresh
A hugely enjoyable, lovable comedy.|Fresh
The Big Sick finds plots by losing them. That's its genius. One moment we are in an ethnic satire; the next a romcom; the next a hospital comedy-drama. But that's existence.|Fresh
Despite the aches and creaks in its extremities, The Big Sick is in rude health where it counts.|Fresh
One of the glories of the film is its ability to find comic details in the most bleak and oppressive situations.|Fresh
Working on a script from Nanjiani and Gordon, director Michael Showalter, who helmed the little-seen but funny Hello, My Name Is Doris, goes soft and gentle when most others would go big and loud.|Fresh
Not quite life-or-death viewing, but as good a star vehicle as Nanjiani might have wished for.|Fresh
Mixing a rom-coma into the romcom, this smart, sweet and highly personal love story finds a winning formula.|Fresh
Edgy and hilarious, Nanjiani and Gordon's true story of cross-cultural love is a Trump-baiting marvel that's worth the hype.|Fresh
The culture-clash comedy plays out with charming, sometimes toe-curling honesty and an acknowledgement of how complicated life can get when expectations weigh heavy and tradition unceremoniously intervenes.|Fresh
A lovely and most welcomed breathe of fresh air for the romantic comedy genre. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a romantic comedy that is not beholden to any formula or any of the tired tropes of this genre. It's main focus is to do justice to a real life romance that seems to have happened only to put on display on the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Michael Showalter directs one of the year's best movies. I'm so glad I got to type those words.|Fresh
Plagiarising their real life experiences on the road to romance, Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon have written a screenplay that oozes with the black comedy of life, which is of course the good oil of strong comedy.|Fresh
It's delicious. A highly entertaining, laugh outlaid film that explores emotions and behaviour and makes us scratch our heads at the complexity of the human condition. Blends humour, pathos, tragedy and fun like a perfect bouquet.|Fresh
An entertaining and deeply felt film.|Fresh
The Big Sick works because its humor feels effortless and true, and the laughs spring out of genuine tragedy.|Fresh
The year's best comedy, an Annie Hall for the age of ISIS.|Fresh
The Big Sick is funny but not laugh-out-loud hysterical, and it's moving but not enough to bring you to tears.|Fresh
The Big Sick is one of the best romantic comedies of our time. A work of 100% sincerity.|Fresh
A hilarious and touching romantic comedy that qualifies as one of best films of 2017.|Fresh
Having previously helped skewer the American romantic comedy, Michael Showalter has created one of the sweetest, funniest modern examples of the genre.|Fresh
A challenging true relationship story.|Fresh
The movie is no fairy tale; it rings sincere because it shows the warts and blemishes that make perfect love nearly impossible, but allows true love to climb its way to the top of relationship mountain.|Fresh
Ramano's character adores his daughter and his wife but tends to ramble on and on about this, that and the other, often to hysterical effect. Hunter's character's intensity is fierce and funny.|Fresh
The all-American The Big Sick is one of the best-edited comedies in memory... Michael Showalter's [movie] that could have sputtered or confounded without the amazing scene-to-scene, shot-to-shot timing of its jokes and sobs.|Fresh
Endearing, surprisingly witty romantic comedy...perfect 'date movie.'|Fresh
A charming love letter to humor and how it helps us cope with life, sickness and the craziness that is life. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Big Sick is a lovely film, at once familiar and unique in its story of relationships and family and the membranes that can separate us or which we create to isolate ourselves.|Fresh
The film earns its silly and sweet moments just as much as all of the serious. It deserves to be the surprise hit of the summer, which it's on its way to being.|Fresh
And now I've found the romantic comedy of the summer and perhaps the year.|Fresh
Rich in emotional honesty and equal parts funny/moving, The Big Sick successfully infuses the traditional rom-com formula with a modern sensibility.|Fresh
At 119 minutes long, it may be too much of a good thing-I have rarely been so aggravated by such a funny and heartwarming film.|Rotten
It is first and foremost a romantic comedy, one that should be enjoyable regardless of your political views. Hysterical, heartbreaking and ultimately heartwarming, you'd be hard-pressed not to fall in love with The Big Sick.|Fresh
The Big Sick turns out to be more than a boy-meets-girl tale. The story that announces itself as an interfaith, interracial romance turns out to be an intergenerational -- and healing -- one as well.|Fresh
The Big Sick is a comedy with real meat and meaning, something that's been lacking from the genre in recent years.|Fresh
It's taken a while, but we finally have the first great comedy of 2017 in The Big Sick.|Fresh
On paper, it sounds over-the-top wacky and saccharine, but The Big Sick treats its subject matter seriously and mines humor from the characters realistically reacting to awkward and extreme situations.|Fresh
Always engaging, if overlong, formulaic and anti-climactic.|Fresh
'The Big Sick,' a sweet little romantic comedy, might ease what ails you from other recent movie-going experiences.|Fresh
A feel-great legit Oscar contender and one of 2017's most heartfelt and enjoyable efforts.|Fresh
You'll leave the theatre with a smile on your face. And that's a pretty nice feeling.|Fresh
The most romantic comedy so far this year.|Fresh
The Big Sick is a healthy breath of fresh air.|Fresh
The Big Sick is a sweet film, even with some rough edges, and it will be fun to see more from Nanjiani in the future.|Fresh
Turning your own life into material for a show is the most stand-up thing in the world, but it's seldom done as skillfully as in this film.|Fresh
"We know where things are going. But frankly, we know where most movies are going. It's how it gets there, and the company we get to keep along the way, that makes ""The Big Sick"" such a winner."|Fresh
The material may be at the sitcom level, but watching these performers play off each other is pure pleasure.|Fresh
See it now, don't wait for it to become a cable TV series. A comatose love interest is definitely anti-episodic.|Fresh
Where some movies would just settle for some good laughs, this one does that and warms the heart, too.|Fresh
Kumail Nanjiani's autobiographical love story has a fantastic hook but its mild demeanor keeps the comedy from having quite the right sting.|Fresh
All the characters are flawed but sympathetic-the film has a true generosity of spirit.|Fresh
"It's hard to overstate just how effectively ""The Big Sick"" balances its romantic inclinations against life-or-death drama, or how its comedy co-exists with potential heartbreak."|Fresh
It delivers a real love story with real humor from real people, and the movies can always use more of those.|Fresh
All of the thoughtful characters missing from the last ten comedies you've seen? They're here.|Fresh
Kumail Nanjiani's performance can't be undervalued... The comic had to sell us every single piece of the puzzle to take us to a tender place. We had to buy his performance without feeling the sheen of revisionism.|Fresh
Human and humane, it is sweet without being saccharine, funny without becoming raucous, and touching without degenerating into mawkishness-the rare rom-com that appeals to your intelligence rather than insulting it.|Fresh
It helps that the story is a true original - one that you have to really see to believe.|Fresh
Wickedly funny, this is a film that does not shy away from conflict and heartbreak, but it also finds the reason that love is worth going through it all.|Fresh
Heartwarming, compassionate and wholly human, The Big Sick is highly recommended.|Fresh
While Nanjiani often rambles off during his stand-up routines in the film, his deadpan comedy is at home in the movie, elevating it during its several uncomfortable interactions.|Fresh
Yes, The Big Sick is a comedy, but it's a comedy that offers up about a million reasons to cry.|Fresh
It's a slightly messy, often funny and humanity-filled alternative to summer blockbusters.|Fresh
Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon have told their own story in a funny, highly engaging way that doesn't feel precious or sanitized, but instead is relatable and engrossing from start to finish. And you'll laugh a hell of a lot.|Fresh
With director Michael Showalter's assured comic tone, The Big Sick rates as a fearless and fearlessly funny look at how cultural collisions can end happily.|Fresh
Where the film comes up short is in the character of Emily herself, Zoe Kazan's open and quick-witted Emily becoming infantalized during her illness and recovery.|Fresh
This heartfelt and frequently hilarious comedy provides a vibrant and life-affirming twist on familiar themes about immigration, cultural traditions, romantic entanglements and fledgling comedians.|Fresh
The best and most original romantic comedy of the year. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Like all Judd Apatow-supervised productions, it's about 10 minutes too long, but that is a small complaint when weighed against Nanjiani and Co.'s remarkable achievement.|Fresh
The Big Sick stands out among the usual rom-com fare, and not just because of the cultural flavours of its lead|Fresh
It's all very naturalistic, funny and surprising, all the more so for not taking the easy path of milking the stand-up scenes for laughs.|Fresh
[Nanjiani and Gordon have] written a comedy that, yes, does recognize the seriousness of the situation but also focuses on the uncomfortable, awkward, and difficult nature of it, too.|Fresh
The movie chugs along on the chemistry between Nanjiani, acquitting himself well as a droll leading man, and Zoe Kazan as his sunny, devoted sweetheart, though they're completely upstaged by Holly Hunter and Ray Romano as the girlfriend's parents|Fresh
Hilarious and heartbreaking with no clear trajectory, frequently catching viewers off guard, it's a rom-com of both heart and brain about a couple tested by illness and clashing cultures.|Fresh
The Big Sick is as personal as it gets, but Gordon and Nanjiani pull no punches and steer well clear of preciousness. I laughed plenty at their film, cried my guts out, too, and went home elated.|Fresh
It's a movie that not only puts human imperfections and incongruities on display, but also revels in them.|Fresh
The movie treats the people on screen generously, and it's a romantic comedy with surprising depth of feeling, glancing on all sorts of things: race, religion, tolerance, understanding, the competitive peculiarity of stand-up comedy ...|Fresh
"There are a lot of reasons to love ""The Big Sick,"" in addition to its intelligence and complex characters. It's hilarious, from start to finish."|Fresh
"You don't have to hole up at home praying to the Netflix, Amazon and Hulu gods for cinematic salvation until the fall. Case in point: ""The Big Sick,"" a small movie that makes a big impact."|Fresh
"I love ""The Big Sick."""|Fresh
With his welcome appearance at the top of the bill, Silicon Valley's Kumail Nanjiani is just one of the good reasons to catch this summer charmer.|Fresh
Despite its pandemic-sounding title, The Big Sick delivers a fresh, funny, endearing and surprisingly emotional story of romance and survival, not necessarily in that order.|Fresh
Nanjiani and Gordon having difficulty managing the nuance of their story and the needs of mainstream cinema. They come up with a picture that has a defined cultural perspective, but remains bland overall.|Rotten
"""The Big Sick,"" with ease and seeming effortlessness, makes us care a lot of about these people, together and separately. And their journey is odd enough to be interesting."|Fresh
Functions...not only as a boilerplate rom-com that's consistently amusing and possessed with charming leads, but also as a heartwarming drama.|Fresh
I could talk about this movie and their story for hours, but I'll leave it at this: please go see The Big Sick.|Fresh
One of the best romantic comedies to hit theaters in a decade.|Fresh
The recent death of the American rom-com has been much remarked upon, but it only takes one great film to zap it back into life. The Big Sick just might be that film.|Fresh
"It's a wildly different experience and the fact that it's true makes ""The Big Sick"" even more unique."|Fresh
Excellent writing, superb acting, expert direction, and more --- it is easily one of the best films of this, or any other, year.|Fresh
It's painstakingly authentic in its evocation of what sometimes feels like the entire conceivable range of emotions. That's because Nanjiani... and Gordon are sharp writers with a knack for underpinning deadpan dialogue with understated emotions.|Fresh
The often slick, just occasionally slack Sick is first and foremost an autobiography, and while it's been designed to deliver maximum laughs and emotion, a quirky authenticity hovers over even its most manipulative moments.|Fresh
Those are a lot of plates for any film to keep spinning, and while it isn't always a complete success - it could stand to lose 15 or 20 minutes - it's the kind of sweetly funny movie love story that's so bizarre that it has to be real.|Fresh
There is comic gold in the cultural disconnect between Kumail and Emily's congenial, if politically incorrect, father.|Fresh
To call The Big Sick the best comedy so far this year is to skimp its appeal. It's a very funny movie with a surprising amount of depth, and somehow the jokes and the seriousness heighten each other.|Fresh
Thoughtful romantic dramedy has swearing, drinking, sex.|Fresh
Easily the best rom-com of 2017, so far, and one of the most touching and daring in years, too.|Fresh
Nanjiani's face has an Old Hollywood repose, but his eyes can melt into pools of concern with barely a flicker of transition.|Fresh
Smart, funny, touching, heartfelt.|Fresh
The Big Sick is bracingly funny, heartrending, and intelligent, a perfect alternative to the pirates, mummies, and other creatures inhabiting multiplexes this summer. No wonder it was the runaway hit of this year's Sundance Film Festival.|Fresh
Anyone who's dealt with an extended hospital stay on either side will relate to this. Hopefully people who have been fortunate enough not to spend time in a hospital will be able to relate to what it's like just waiting, not knowing, not being told.|Fresh
The Big Sick can sometimes be awfully conventional, but among its key assets is its radiant view of its characters.|Fresh
"Movie characters spend more time lounging around hospitals than pharmacy reps, but The Big Sick is the first ""hospital film"" in a while that makes us feel the stakes of a vicious mystery disease in our guts."|Fresh
It's a lot for any movie to take on. The Big Sick pulls it off with unquenchable humor and ineffable grace.|Fresh
There are some sweet early scenes establishing the characters' rapport... but Gordon and Nanjiani are so enamored of the standup-comedy world that it takes nearly 40 minutes for an actual conflict to be brought up.|Rotten
Tore than a love story, this is a story about Kumail's relationship with two sets of parents, his own and Emily's -- and both are full of conflicts that range from hilarious to frustrating to incredibly sweet.|Fresh
Invigorates the Apatovian formula and indeed an entire genre with a thorny study of interracial relationships and the bonds that hold immigrant families together across an ever-widening generation gap.|Fresh
Nanjiani and Gordon are reluctant to paint themselves or their families in broad strikes, each character a dysfunctional maelstrom of good and bad, and it's this genuine fact-based texture that helps to make the film feel far from a Hollywood construct.|Fresh
This is an impressive first feature, one that resonates more strongly thanks to its fact-based underpinnings.|Fresh
What The Big Sick gets at, in its obvious but necessary manner, is how America undermines traditions from other countries, and always has.|Fresh
"""Authentic"" is an overused word in movie reviews, but there's no better way to describe The Big Sick: Every inch of it feels true, and not just because it's drawn from real life."|Fresh
Again and again, [Showalter] finds that laughter-through-tears sweet spot, often in the unlikeliest of places.|Fresh
A joyous, generous-hearted romantic comedy that, even as it veers into difficult terrain, insists that we just need to keep on laughing.|Fresh
"It's an exceedingly high degree of difficulty to hit the perfect chord of humor and heart, plucking the heartstrings just so, blending laughter and tears, and ""The Big Sick"" strums them just right."|Fresh
