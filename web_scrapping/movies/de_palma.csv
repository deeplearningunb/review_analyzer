"... de Palma is honest about the probability that his glory days are behind him. Still, ""De Palma"" makes a great case for the merits of films like ""Carrie"" and ""Blow Out"" and leaves one wishing for a de Palma retro."|Fresh
No one kills people with the bravura relish of De Palma. He is the Michelangelo of Murder, a man who crafts decadent, deviant works of art using viscera and celluloid in lieu of paint.|Fresh
The film may live as little more than a supplement on a future box set, but Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow do well enough to give a sense of the breadth De Palma's career while letting the iconoclastic director write his history in his own way.|Fresh
For over 100 deliriously entertaining minutes, De Palma unspools like a mixtape of the master's most arresting flourishes and set pieces. All killer, no filler.|Fresh
Meant to be a tribute, De Palma mostly reminds you of how many terrible movies he's made.|Rotten
A serious examination of De Palma as an auteur, coming through one of the most fevered epochs of Hollywood history and surviving to tell the tale.|Fresh
You'll dig this movie a ton, because it's basically a master filmmaker taking a stroll down memory lane and exploring what makes his work stand out.|Fresh
You'll learn more about the art of filmmaking in this documentary than from any course in the UCLA or NYU film school.|Fresh
[His] candid commentary reveals him to be a cultivated man with a gut-bucket sensibility trying to make mass-market commercial hits but who rarely finds the right combination of style and substance. At least we now know why he did what he did.|Fresh
Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow are the co-directors of De Palma, a scrumptious documentary about the creator of Carrie and Scarface.|Fresh

By the end, regardless of how one feels about any number of his pictures, there is no question that he was a man who made movies exactly the way he intended.|Fresh
De Palma is a straightforward interview with the director of Carrie and Scarface, who talks about his movies with a beefy vigour akin to his cinematic style.|Fresh
Just to hear the director discuss his work and his influences, all while seeing his iconic scenes on the big screen once again make this essential viewing for cinephiles.|Fresh
At 76, the New Jersey native is able to laugh at himself and his missteps (Mission To Mars, Obsession) while speaking candidly and squarely about the times he got it right (take your pick from any of Scarface, Carrie, The Untouchables, Carlito's Way).|Fresh
The man himself is the sole interviewee -- a risky strategy but one that pays off here; whether dissing his Obsession star Cliff Robertson or conceding mistakes on The Bonfire of the Vanities, he's illuminating, hilarious company.|Fresh
De Palma the movie makes a good argument for a re-assessment of De Palma the director, an artist whose work remains a fascinating and entertaining study in the public's fickle taste.|Fresh
Fascinating ...|Fresh
De Palma's work is explored in his own words, and his words only, uncluttered by talking heads and critical evaluations. And frankly, De Palma is such an entertaining and open raconteur, his words are all you need.|Fresh
For cinephiles and De Palma fans, this is essential viewing.|Fresh
Rational and often hilarious, De Palma the raconteur is as brazen as his films.|Fresh
The documentary convinces us of De Palma's logistical and visual flair -- his ability to choreograph astonishingly elaborate sequences and his pioneering use of Steadicam.|Fresh
This is a very entertaining guide.|Fresh
Whether one is a fan of those films or not, this makes for a fascinating insight into the craft.|Fresh
Riveting and highly entertaining.|Fresh
Anyone who loves the movie business will find his anecdotes, revelations, and observations both enlightening and entertaining.|Fresh
DePalma repeating himself is better than most filmmakers saying something for the first time.|Fresh
It's this frankness, free of artifice, devoid of a censor, that makes this documentary what it is.|Fresh
We emerge with a profound understanding of a singularly talented, wildly creative filmmaker who invested himself fully in everything he did, and whose oeuvre more than merits a second look.|Fresh
Doesn't hold us to the same exacting standards De Palma would.|Rotten
"Brian De Palma is currently one of America's best filmmakers, or at least one of its most stylishly singular, and... ""De Palma"" cannily sheds light on exactly why."|Fresh
If you ever wonder why movies are too long, listen to a director talk about himself for almost two hours. It's interesting but I would have liked to have heard from others about what it was like to work with him, too.|Fresh
By all measures, he's made it. Yet De Palma's rosy round face carries a hint of garden-troll darkness, an itch of bitterness that never quite blisters into a boil, but seethes beneath the skin all the same.|Fresh
De Palma, based on the life of Brian, is an instant film-school classic, distilling a whole career into a tidy 107 minutes and offering a crash course to anyone who loves the language of cinema.|Fresh
There's more than enough of merit here to recommend it, particularly to cineasts who live and breathe film.|Fresh
As a cinematic appetizer platter of clips and stories, De Palma is a chance to gorge. If you care about movies, you'll gobble this up with a knife and fork.|Fresh
Since so many of De Palma's films have become part and parcel with the American cultural consciousness of the last 50 years, I can't imagine this filmmaker's insights not providing every viewer with some memorable takeaways.|Fresh
De Palma fans will eat it up.|Fresh
It's De Palma's breakdown of the unwritten laws of Hollywood and his demystification of filmmaking technique that make this an important film for any moviegoer.|Fresh
Unlike some interviews with directors, he's not sharing stories and anecdotes we've heard dozens of times before. Even more fascinating, the stories of his flops are, in most cases, way better than the hits. (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
The De Palma of De Palma ultimately comes off as the same one behind his movies: a talented filmmaker, but not a deeply introspective one.|Fresh
If you love movies, see De Palma. Then you need to cue up his films and start watching or re-watching his entire filmography.|Fresh
De Palma resembles more of a visual IMDB page than a film.|Rotten
By the end, what registers is something more than just a trek through a filmography -- though it will make you want to stage your own mini film retrospective. It's a portrait of a man in full, his wisdom, his trials and his triumphs.|Fresh
One of the best movies ever made about making movies.|Fresh
The film is a masterclass in filmmaking as De Palma discusses his use of the camera, split screen and makes mention of the split diopter.|Fresh
"For those who have an interest in film as an art and cinema as a culture, ""De Palma"" is fairly riveting, a master class in filmmaking tied into a history of contemporary cinema, with an unexpectedly personal look into the life of De Palma himself."|Fresh
"De Palma is not a shallow artist, but this documentary offers a shallow retrospective on his art, his celebrity, and his ""controversy."""|Rotten
The film will appeal mostly to fans of the director's work, but even the more general cinephile will find much of interest here in its plainspoken ways.|Fresh
De Palma proves the filmmaker to be a great storyteller without the use of a camera.|Fresh
De Palma enthusiasts will benefit the most here (small surprise), but there's good material for anyone interested in how their cinematic sausage gets made.|Fresh
An engaging if superficial sit, not just for his fans but also for anyone who seeks to understand cinematic grammar and the often un-pretty process of how movies get made.|Fresh
"""De Palma"" deftly covers the full gamut of the man's films, from the early Robert De Niro collaboration ""The Wedding Party"" (shot in 1963) through commercial breakthroughs in the 1970s and then several more career ups and downs afterward."|Fresh
If you love movies, it's time well spent.|Fresh
He's allowed to ruminate, largely, and what's revealed is an artist impulsively self-reflective, whatever side of the camera he's on.|Fresh
It's a ride through a broad filmography that, while varied in terms of stories told, always finds room for elaborate homages to the cinema that shaped it.|Fresh
None of this will win over the De Palma haters, but they are clearly outside the intended audience here.|Fresh
Brian De Palma has been the most neglected of the '70s Movie Brats in recent critical discourse - and unfairly so.|Fresh
The documentary's commitment to being thorough is admirable. But that urge to be comprehensive is also how De Palma shoots itself in the foot.|Fresh
Alluringly smooth and uncluttered, as if taking its cue from one of the tracking shots so beloved by its subject.|Fresh
Pungent retellings project-by-project across the decades of De Palma's career|Fresh
Made for fans, by fans, De Palma is a straightforward, riveting doc about one of the brightest movie minds we've ever known.|Fresh

A full-throated defense of a man whose work towers over so many of his peers and yet is so often casually dismissed|Fresh
"More than just a big-screen fetish object for Brian De Palma's still-loyal cult, ""De Palma"" is one of the essential documentaries on Hollywood."|Fresh
This documentary is so endlessly fascinating as DePalma talks about every aspect of filmmaking from costume to camera shots to casting that one can only hope at least several of the hours left on the cutting room floor end up on a blu ray release.|Fresh
"""De Palma's"" biggest asset, not surprisingly, is the man himself."|Fresh
De Palma walked away from Hollywood 15 years ago. He has nothing to lose by telling these stories now. They make De Palma brisk and engaging ...|Fresh
De Palma has the best kind of ending for a director documentary: it leaves us wondering what's yet to come from this protean and multifaceted filmmaker.|Fresh
Mr. De Palma is remarkable company - witty, insightful and neither unduly modest nor overbearingly vain.|Fresh
Mr. De Palma is an American director of great consequence, and this movie about him and his remarkable career is long overdue.|Fresh
More rewarding for neophytes and casual fans than it is for the titular director's hardcore devotees, Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow's doc is nevertheless essential viewing for everyone.|Fresh
"""De Palma"" treats its subject as the gonzo genius of genre cinema, which is to say it gives him his due."|Fresh
Can simply be enjoyed simply as comfort food, a chance for acolytes to escape from the world for two hours - not just into one movie but into an entire life's worth.|Fresh
This conversation with polarizing director Brian De Palma accompanied by brilliantly chosen clips from his dark masterworks is heaven for movie lovers. By all means, geek out. I did; now it's your turn.|Fresh
De Palma is just De Palma gabbing for two hours into a camera, and that's its ultimate limitation, but also its great strength.|Fresh
It all adds up to an exposure that goes well beyond appraisal, entering into rare realms of frustration, dysfunction, euphoria and cynicism.|Fresh
In [directors Baumbach and Paltrow's] minimalist take on a maximalist artist, they leave the man and his work free to stand or fall on their own.|Fresh
For all the interestingly schizophrenic attitudes it captures, its gaze is finally too straightforward to honor a director who has always kept us guessing about the best place to look.|Rotten
Garrulous and good-humored, De Palma presides over Paltrow and Baumbach's film, taking us through his life and career step by step, title by title, in chronological order.|Fresh
This is a film about a great artist reckoning with a much-debated body of work|Fresh
Like Hitchcock, De Palma reveals himself to be guided by an unusual mixture of intuition and intellectualization.|Fresh
...the picture boasts a decidedly fascinating vibe that persists for the duration of its 107 minutes.|Fresh
A remarkable film.|Fresh
'De Palma' has both the scope and specificity of the essential text 'Hitchcock/Truffaut,' covering the entire career while pausing for in-depth explanations.|Fresh
A fascinating, revealing, and compelling overview of a remarkably eclectic career.|Fresh
As a fan of De Palma's work-which doesn't mean I've liked all his movies-I found De Palma riveting.|Fresh
Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow's De Palma is a cineaste's dream. Better yet, it's like getting a minor in film studies, with De Palma as the the candid, mensch-y professor.|Fresh
So many documentaries about artists just want you to accept that their subject is an innovator. De Palma breaks it down and shows you why he is.|Fresh
"More edited than directed, ""De Palma"" is rightfully content to let the director of such classics as ""Carrie"" and ""Scarface"" tell the story of his career."|Fresh
"""De Palma"" is a joy: a hit of garrulous cinephile cocaine so pure you want to do a Tony Montana, fall face-first into it and inhale it all in one go."|Fresh
In this highly entertaining documentary, directed by Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow, De Palma mounts a robust defence of the more contentious moments of his career, while also taking a few well-aimed potshots at the current state of the film industry.|Fresh
So revealing, and entertaining, that little is needed here other than the man, his opinions and some telling illustrations.|Fresh
While I wouldn't willingly subject myself to a second viewing of The Bonfire of the Vanities or Snake Eyes, I would happily listen to De Palma expound on what works and what doesn't in those movies.|Fresh
Steered by Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow, Brian De Palma holds court in a delightful, illuminating career reflection.|Fresh
Could still benefit from some structural polish but a blast nonetheless.|Fresh
