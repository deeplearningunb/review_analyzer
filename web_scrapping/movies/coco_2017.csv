This is a powerful, intense movie, and while it may be a little too dark for very young viewers, Coco manages to deliver lessons about identity and life in an entertaining way, and ultimately makes for very satisfying (and emotional) viewing.|Fresh
Moving, amusing and downright grooving, Coco stands out in the Pixar pantheon as their first truly diverse feature.|Fresh
A very special film.|Fresh
Great animated film with a taboo subject that's very well executed. Tears will eventually come. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
If one were to describe Coco in one word, it'd be beautiful, as not only the scenarios and colours presented in this film are beautiful and astonishing, but the story as well, as it remarks in one of the most important things there are, family.|Fresh
[Coco] is sumptuous and sincere, with a generosity of spirit that matches Pixar's usual M.O. perfectly.|Fresh
Coco is an amazing cinematic experience, and I have little doubt that it will be revered ultimately as one of the greatest achievements in film history, not just animated film history.|Fresh

"""Coco"" is one of Pixar's best films yet"|Fresh
The heart that beats beneath Coco is one of passion, care, and tradition.|Fresh
Pixar delivers another virtually flawless film that brings much more culture and originality than their recent releases.|Fresh
Coco may very well be my favorite Pixar film to date. But how does it not pass the Bechdel Test??|Fresh
Coco hits all the right notes but still feels like the same old song|Rotten
Both a respectful tribute to Mexican culture and a grin-inducing, thematically powerful and intensely gorgeous adventure, Coco really is magical.|Fresh
"The storyline and Miguel's journey through it allows for what's effectively a walking tour of Mexico's lasting contributions to art, music, movies sports and pop-culture in a way that feels genuine and ""lived."""|Fresh
The intricacies of its culture are deeply felt on a visual, auditory and thematic level.|Fresh
Once again, Pixar has delivered an enchanting tale with Coco that features everything that makes Pixar great - it has ample heart, plenty of jokes for adults and children, and groundbreaking visuals unlike anything I've ever seen before.|Fresh
The film brilliantly races along to the melody of several ear-worm musical numbers that will have you humming along as they touch your soul.|Fresh
...it's steeped in familiar, if not comforting, tropes.|Fresh
After a swarm of money-grabbing sequels, it's decidedly wonderful to see Pixar returning to their core roots of delivering refreshing and original pieces of cinema.|Fresh
Original, fun, heartfelt and worth multiple viewings. A true return to form for Pixar. I may need another box of Kleenex.|Fresh
The bones of the plot may be a touch more cumbersome than they should have been, but the tale is superbly vivified with humour, visual finery and pathos.|Fresh
Here, the dead are more than just alive; they are festive, hyperkinetic, masters of crooning, sensitive, educative and ... able to get the whole house roaring.|Fresh
Its message of being true to one's self is an important enough one to give [young children] a chance to try [processing the wealth of exposition].|Fresh
[Coco] is ... incredibly animated and densely researched, recreating the splendours of Mexico and its traditions without resorting to cheap stereotypes and broad generalizations.|Fresh
This is a beautiful film, filled with visual wonder and warm humour, not to mention packing one of the year's hardest emotional punches. If you aren't left feeling completely moved by it, I'd suggest urgently checking your pulse.|Fresh
In a country with an ever increasing Hispanic and Mexican population, a film like Coco should have come around a long time ago.|Fresh
Unkrich's 2nd feature proves that with great animation, stellar storytelling, and moving moments of emotion, animated movies are still the best forms of filmmaking out there.|Fresh
Thankfully, the final product is a wholesome love letter to a beloved occasion, which tugs at your heart strings just like a Mariachi's guitarr√≥n.|Fresh
I don't think there's any question that Coco is really great.|Fresh
This is a warm-hearted movie that probes deeper into the meaning of family and independence. It dives into Mexican culture with much gusto and joyous music, but its story has a universal power.|Fresh
It really took me to another place.|Fresh
A starting point for acts of kindness and of joy and remembering. And given Miguel's sunny optimism and all-embracing love, Coco is superior holiday viewing.|Fresh
An endearing fable, one that confronts the past in order to find meaning in the future.|Fresh
It may not rival 'Inside Out' or 'Toy Story' as an all-time great Pixar film, but it certainly lands in the upper echelon and is one of their better original movies in years.|Fresh
Coco is beautifully animated; a cute story which at times is quite moving. It may be a rather forgettable Pixar product, but in the moment, it has its charm.|Fresh
Coco never feels like a crass bid for foreign markets. Instead, it comes across as a celebration of the ways culture can unite us across borders.|Fresh
All you really need to know is this: Pixar knocks another one out of the graveyard and into the afterlife.|Fresh
On the whole, Coco is a stunning achievement from the most consistently impressive animation studio in the business.|Fresh
Only the coldest of hearts will make it through Coco without shedding a tear.|Fresh
Set around the Mexican festival of the Day of the Dead, Coco is a riot of colour peppered with great songs, gags and thrills.|Fresh
"The filmmakers ""captured"" a living story, made it their own and gave it to the world. [Full review in Spanish}"|Fresh
Pixar has outdone itself. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Pixar's best film in nearly a decade receives an expectedly resplendent home-video treatment, sporting a demo-ready A/V transfer befitting the film's visual and musical splendor.|Fresh
[A] sincere and loving reproduction of a tradition full of nuances. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Once you get to the land of the dead it is beautiful, both in story as well as animation. The animation is so good in this movie.|Fresh
There's an authenticity to the scenes in Miguel's Mexican town and a reverence for the traditions that makes Coco a refreshingly respectful portrayal of the culture.|Fresh
As it builds to it's surprising twist, Coco becomes one of the most emotionally satisfying tales from a studio that has built a reputation for emotionally satisfying tales.|Fresh
Coco's creativity and joyfulness is always rooted in tradition, and Miguel's experience becomes a truly emotional coming-of-age story.|Fresh
Coco is always a luminous, playful and colorful film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It requires a lot of exposition but it's well done and once complete, this gloriously animated, musically lovely and supremely Mexican visual feast flies along.|Fresh
A wonderful return to form for Pixar, who again deliver the emotional and creative goods while exploring other cultures with a genuine, tangible, love and respect.|Fresh
Coco delivers heartwarming storytelling and eye-catching visuals, all the while honouring the power of family and music.|Fresh
The film has a galloping rhythm, and the animation is scrupulous and ravishing, from its smallest details to its limitless landscapes.|Fresh
On paper, the mythology scans as complicated and dark, but in the capable hands of Academy Award winner Lee Unkrich and Pixar veteran Adrian Molina, Coco is accessible for even the youngest cinema patrons.|Fresh
A film that will become the standard-bearer of a positive example of what the Latino experience can look like on the big screen for years to come.|Fresh
Much to my surprise, given my initial reaction to the story, I found myself crying at the end.|Fresh
It's certainly a substantial improvement on recent misfires like The Good Dinosaur and last year's barrel-scraping Cars 3.|Fresh
Pixar ups their game every time...the music is very catchy, as warm as the theme and tone of the movie...by the end, I was a sobbing mess.|Fresh
Coco manages its humor and music in exact doses, not transforming the story with them, but by using them as an expressive material to continue advancing Miguel's journey. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The director, Lee Unkrich, knows how to get an audience reaching for the Kleenex, and the climax here is a similar wipeout. You have been warned.|Fresh
Complicated? Yes, and a little slow, too. But the animation is as colourful as the story and emotions do eventually reach the desired level.|Fresh
Pixar's latest project is a glittering return to non-franchise form after 2015's lacklustre The Good Dinosaur.|Fresh
Its victorious denouement offers everyone a different way to think about what it means to live on, and how that starts by treating those dearest to us well.|Fresh
The necropolis Miguel explores is a magnificent creation, a heaving, neon-lit, labyrinth...Coco has heart as well as jokes, and there are probably worse ways of introducing children to the party-pooping concept of death.|Fresh
At worst it suggests that the brains trust at Pixar, after 22 years of peerless output (Toy Story was 1995), is finally eating itself. At best, well, it's a superbly polished, technically flawless family film that makes you cry. And this is bad how?|Fresh
Funny, irreverent and eye-popping. It will also make you want to cry at least once but possibly as many as three times.|Fresh
An unmissable treat for the whole family.|Fresh
A sumptuous, expressively animated film, as dazzling as fireworks.|Fresh
I'd love to see kids try and place this portrayal of Mexico alongside Trump's. Good luck with building that wall pal. Joyous.|Fresh
Coco is a magical journey that is as uplifting as it is -- at times -- heart-breaking.|Fresh
Pixar's latest offering Coco is a breath of fresh air in the animated movie universe.|Fresh
This is a charming and very memorable film.|Fresh
The spirit-raising fantasy single-handedly atones for years of Mexican cartoon stereotypes.|Fresh
"Coco is just a beautiful film that presents death as an adventure that is as big as life. We dare you not to cry, laugh or furiously tap that foot to ""Un Poco Loco""!"|Fresh
It's a fun story, emphasizing family and heritage, and the digital animation is superb.|Fresh
Despite the fact that it's so well told and really beautifully directed, it doesn't have as investing a story as I would have liked because it does feel like other things we've seen before. But still, this is a good movie.|Fresh
... a heartfelt film, full of fun, culture and moments that will have you reaching for tissues.|Fresh
It's handled in such a way that the characters become very lovable.|Fresh
Every little side or subplot that this movie takes, whether it involves Miguel or someone else in his family or just some seemingly ancillary characters, it pays off so richly, so beautiful, from start to finish.|Fresh
... Coco is another triumph for Pixar...|Fresh
Funny and heart-tugging with some knockout tunes, the movie glows with warmth. And how many kids' cartoons would include a running Frida Kahlo gag? One to treasure.|Fresh
The film doesn't go where you initially expect it might go and is all the better for it.|Fresh
Though in many ways it treads similar ground, Coco is a film rich in heart, so much so that the film's few flaws fail to take away from the overall experience.|Fresh
Not top-tier Pixar. But decent enough.|Fresh
It may lack the ingenuity of their finest outings, but this is Pixar's best film in ages. Visually splendid, frequently emotional and culturally nourishing.|Fresh
Coco's sincerity is undeniable and its creativity often remarkable. The songs might be unlikely earworms but the film easily earns its place in your heart.|Fresh
Pixar has raised the animation bar again, with its most musical - and arguably most magical - film yet. If this is the afterlife we're all headed to, don't fear the reaper.|Fresh
... for children and adults. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A joyous musical adventure that should charm adults just as much as the kids it is aimed at.|Fresh
I left Coco angry that its entire plot needn't have happened if the family had ever once acted reasonably or communicated properly.|Rotten
Both a colourful sight to behold and an exuberant journey; a film exploding with dazzling visual and emotional fireworks.|Fresh
This is a beautifully touching tale that has a lot of say about celebrating the past and why me must remember those who have come before us.|Fresh
While the animation is Pixar perfect, I don't think the story grips the viewer.|Fresh
Like Up before it, Coco is likely to make you shed a few tears, but here the sadness is met with joy.|Fresh
It seems like the kind of speculative material that would be easy to get spectacularly wrong, and it is to Disney and Pixar's credit that they've been bold enough to go there, with class, respect and ultimate integrity.|Fresh
Another Pixar masterpiece. It sits comfortably with Toy Story 3, Finding Dory and Inside Out as one of the best Pixar films this decade.|Fresh
Not exactly top-tier Pixar...|Fresh
Every plot point and thematic implication slots into place, but the pleasures of Coco are above all visual. I don't think I've ever seen a computer-animated film so rich in detail, or so dedicated to recreating complex and beautiful lighting schemes.|Fresh
Aside from the look of the movie, it's the themes and story that push it over the top in the best possible way. Coco explores what it is to follow your dreams, respect your family and that seeing is not always believing.|Fresh
... there's an overwhelming sense of deja vu about Coco.|Fresh
Such a film stands or falls on the quality of the music, and Coco delivers on that. The original songs are very good indeed, and the animated concerts are stupendous fun.|Fresh
The film can be seen as a model of the new wave diversity movement in Hollywood, with its story focus simultaneously acknowledging one of the world's main cultural components while, incidentally, tapping into its lucrative market.|Fresh
Coco features intriguing tensions between the need to love your nearest and dearest yet be ready to say goodbye, and the need to understand and respect the past.|Fresh
Coco continues Pixar's tradition of combining vibrant, detailed animation with nuanced and impactful emotional themes.|Fresh
The netherworld into Miguel and his ultra-adorable (and hyper-clumsy) canine sidekick Dante must journey is pure Pixar creativity at its eye-popping visual best.|Fresh
Coco is lush, vibrant, teeming with life and altogether delightful. And because of the authenticity and respect the film makers have shown to their story and its people, this film just bursts with joy. Bravo.|Fresh
This is a great, lively film defined not only by the joy inherent in music, but by a pervasive love for human beings, imperfections and all.|Fresh
Coco is a heartwarming story, about not only the importance of family and following your dreams, but also whether a person's mistakes are redeemable.|Fresh
And the animation itself is superb, its renderings of the land of the dead even more vibrant than that of the living. That's ironic. Pero tambi√©n es interesante, no?|Fresh
The Day of the Dead, which spans the full spectrum of human emotions, proves to be an extraordinarily fertile backdrop for director Lee Unkrich and his team.|Fresh
The film's message of cherishing our elders rather than our idols is a poignant one for adults as well as kids.|Fresh
A simple but very humane story, full of memorable and adorable characters, and a really impressive visual style. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's an emotional ride with lots of color and fun along the way. Coco is definitely a must-see this holiday season, just be sure to remember the Pixar 3 and bring tissues.|Fresh

There is no folklorism, but love and respect for Mexican popular culture.|Fresh
All good, however, very far from the best. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Coco is a perfectly calculated and orchestrated emotional avalanche. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
There is a lot to admire about Coco, particularly its energy and its story that attempts to find resolution between commitment to one's family and one's own sense of identity.|Fresh
A very lovely movie that contains not one single surprise in its comfortably loose 109 minutes.|Fresh
Coco is a beautiful and moving film, but there's something inherently funny about Pixar now making movies where even dead people die again.|Fresh
A dramatic, dazzling adventure that puts a fresh spin on la importancia de la familia.|Fresh
Disney-Pixar's best at least since Toy Story 3.|Fresh
After its spectacular visuals and music, its true and celebrational inclusion of Mexican culture; what stays with us about COCO, is the loving heart of a family, and the strength of a little boy who won't give up his dream.|Fresh
A beautiful ode to the love of family.|Fresh
Besides being the first great Pixar movie about Hispanics, Coco is the best film about Alzheimer's since Marjorie Prime and Away From Her.|Fresh
This turns out to be a very heartwarming story about family and the ending is quite emotional. The golden touch of Pixar and executive producer John Lasseter is evident here.|Fresh
Enter Coco, a movie that has both Pixar's knack for the timeless, and that couldn't feel more timely and culturally important in the moment.|Fresh
American films often are accused of either making a caricature of the minorities or of dumbing down their culture, their traditions. Coco thankfully escapes both allegations.|Fresh
Coco is a fun, touching movie, one that takes joy in the culture it depicts and invites viewers from other cultures along for the party, in ways both respectful and educational.|Fresh
A nearly complete triumph, with a distinctive look, truly virtuoso animation, and a compelling, tear-jerking story|Fresh
There are not enough superlatives for this film. It's a masterpiece.|Fresh
"The work on screen is tireless, spinning a loving and immersive tale of memories, familial love and gratitude and the importance of holding onto where you've come from while forging your own path."""|Fresh

Kids under about 7 or 8, not to mention squeamish parents, might be freaked out by a few things rarely discussed or seen in animated films.|Fresh
In fact, as unlikely as this may seem, you'll find yourself thinking of this movie long after it's ended.|Fresh
The visuals of Coco are amazing from the bridge of flowers to the world of the dead. It's clear that Pixar took great care in getting Latin culture perfect.|Fresh
The film represents a full embrace of a culture and its people, as well as a celebration of family, both present and past. As such, it's difficult to imagine healthier holiday fare.|Fresh
Directors Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina, helped out by writers Jason Katz and Matthew Aldrich and a full-size city of technicians and crew, hit the right chords, gracefully.|Fresh
As bright and colorful as it is, Coco feels more than a bit cut-and-pasted from previous Pixar efforts.It's not enough that much of Pixar's competition steals its formulas, it's as if the company is left having to pillage itself.|Fresh
I feel a little better about my own mortality after seeing Coco; apparently all I need to do to live forever is make sure the living keep remembering me.|Fresh
It's no exaggeration to say it shows us things we've never seen before, something that happens so rarely in modern cinema.|Fresh
...a blunt, manic film that is worthy of Pixar's award-winning canon, but not as important as it should have been.|Fresh
A wonderful animated feature set around the Day of the Dead in Mexico.|Fresh
Another creative Pixar/Disney character and critter movie. Never had the Land of the Dead had more life.|Fresh
"You'll go cuckoo for ""Coco."""|Fresh

"""Coco"" is ravishing and almost seductive in the way it entices you. Not sure we've done enough good in our world to deserve such a gem. Open your heart to its excellence."|Fresh
"Add... its magical array of visuals - an entire ""Land of the Dead"" is realized - and its kind, loving representation of Mexican culture, and ""Coco"" becomes a force for good in the world."|Fresh
It's delightful stuff, made no less delightful by the darkness, most of which is handled so frankly that one simply grows accustomed to it.|Fresh
Forgiveness and love are but two sides of the same peso.|Fresh
Pixar's transcendent fable Coco is filled with visual wonders|Fresh
You know the writing is solid when animated characters can touch your heart so deeply that a tissue is needed.|Fresh
Coco is an improvement, drawing upon magic realism and dizzying technical detail to create an immersive entertainment that never condescends to its audience.|Fresh
The movie's so enthralling that you won't even notice the emotional currents building steadily and powerfully underneath - until it wallops you with them, of course.|Fresh
Still, what really blew me away about Coco is the historic but long-overdue feat of being the first-ever movie with an all-Latino voice cast. It paid off.|Fresh
This bright and mostly entertaining Coco honors Mexico.|Fresh
Coco is worthwhile, just not as much so as I honestly hoped it would be.|Fresh
... savor the sights and sounds of this latest Pixar win, achieved in unique fashion.|Fresh
The film, despite its ostensibly creepy trappings, is a good, if not great, run through the standard Pixar formula that is bolstered by its distinct visual style and the long-overdue expansion of its cultural palette.|Fresh
Some of the darkest ideas ever to manifest in a Disney-Pixar film take center stage in Coco, a movie that magically doubles as the studio's most colorful, vibrant adventure yet.|Fresh

... both amusing and touching, using a celebration of death to prompt a fresh perspective on life.|Fresh

Coco is a bold and colorful animated dazzler of a movie with a story of family that goes straight to the heart of young and old alike, which means it's the kind of movie that Pixar used to make.|Fresh
The liveliest movie of the season is about dead people: Pixar Animation Studio's new movie Coco, a joyous celebration of memory linking our past to our present.|Fresh
The movie may encourage youngsters to ponder the perils of succumbing to the blinding light of celebrity and it shows -- in obviously literal fashion -- that there's much to be gained from honoring and remembering those who have gone before us.|Fresh
It's the kind of story Pixar has told before, but there's enough variation to make it feel fresh.|Fresh
Coco's flaws and limitations would sting less if it weren't the one original Pixar film in a string of sequels...With each new release it seems clearer that Pixar's glory days are an increasingly distant memory.|Fresh
"Pixar rebounds nicely with Coco, a big, spangly animated fiesta with its fair share of ""heart."""|Fresh
Coco wonderfully explores familial themes, identity, and learning what it means to grow up in a world that isn't perfect.|Fresh

It's not a stretch to speculate that this movie --- while a lock for a Best Animated Feature nomination --- is a legitimate contender for Best Picture.|Fresh
'Coco' has a big heart. It's an embracing experience that stresses not only the importance of family, but of heritage - of who your ancestors are and why they made the choices they did.|Fresh
Pixar's heartfelt tribute to Mexico. Also, the best animated film of the year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Brimming with life, rich cultural heritage, dazzling color, beautiful music, and incomparable animation, [this is] a celebratory affair that's bound to strike the right chord.|Fresh
If you want to know whether or not your kid is creepy, ask them what lesson they learned from Coco.|Fresh

"The colorful visuals are matched with lively music, especially de la Cruz's signature song, ""Remember Me."""|Fresh
"""Coco"" worked on me in ways I hadn't expected."|Fresh
"It packs a couple of ""didn't see that coming"" moments, and closes with an obligatory family reunion emanating such joyous emotion, its deficiencies earn our forgiveness as well."|Fresh
In the end, it's all too much, yet at the same time not enough. Despite its efforts, Coco can't rise above mid-tier Pixar.|Rotten

Adrian Molina and Matthew Aldrich's screenplay constantly surprises with its inspirations...|Fresh
Luckily for the audience, the animation is Pixar perfect and stunning to behold. And there are enough visual skeleton gags to distract children in the audience from the fact that story is somewhat hard to follow.|Fresh
Not only is it a wholly original story, but it also honors a culture that's so often overlooked by the movie industry. That alone might have made it a hit, but Coco has so much more to offer.|Fresh
Every step of the way in Coco is a visual and sonic delight.|Fresh
The script's ghoulish touches and mordant flashes of wit turn out to be its most disarming qualities.|Fresh
"Dazzling visuals along with intricately structured and deeply moving storytelling are the hallmarks of the best of the studio's animated movies. ""Coco"" has those in spades ..."|Fresh
Coco's heart is its ethnicity.|Fresh
Being Pixar, the picture looks wonderful - lighting cinematographer Danielle Fienberg has outshone herself - but in the end, the derivative Coco lacks the spark of life found in The Book of Life.|Rotten
Once again, Pixar delivers the most delightfuland insightful family movie of the season.|Fresh

At various moments, Coco is simply the most beautiful film Pixar has ever made, each shot a striking work of art.|Fresh
Coco gets better as it goes, growing into something stranger and more resonant than its boy's-adventure setup suggests.|Fresh
Purgatorial politics aside, the story is actually a sweet meditation on family and destiny, and the ways in which one can trump the other.|Fresh
Coco may not represent Disney/Pixar at its pinnacle but it's close enough to the top to warrant consideration as the best computer-drawn film of 2017.|Fresh
"""Coco"" uses the vibrant colors and style of the holiday to spin an imaginative tale rich in tradition and culture, while beautifully celebrating family."|Fresh
