This gripping documentary about Gennadiy Mokhnenko, aka Pastor Crocodile, a controversial child-welfare activist in Ukraine, has the propulsive power and arc of a drama.|Fresh
Searchig for a concealed subtext seems unnecessary when the story itself is so extraordinary.|Fresh
"A telling scene where he gets worked up about the ""criticism"" of him on his Wikipedia page hints at a darker side to his character, and he doesn't take kindly to a journalist querying his vigilante methods."|Fresh

In the end, we are left with a powerful account of one man determined to make a difference in a country that is spiralling far beyond any individual's control.|Fresh

A scrupulously balanced portrait of a highly influential activist and vivid snapshot of Ukraine's marginalized and exploited youth.|Fresh

Steve Hoover's documentary affords one an unusually intimate glance at the collapsed infrastructure of the former Soviet Union.|Fresh
Hoover's style seems equally fit for a bleak documentary, suspenseful thriller, black comedy, dystopian sci-fi nightmare and grisly horror film.|Fresh
In the midst of this struggle come moments of extraordinary beauty.|Fresh
A charismatic subject sympathetically portrayed in a structurally clumsy documentary.|Fresh
