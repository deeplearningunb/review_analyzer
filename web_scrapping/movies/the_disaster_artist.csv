Never has a bad movie been so good - The Disaster Artist will delight members of the Tommy Wiseau cult and newcomers simultaneously.|Fresh
The genius of The Disaster Artist is that they made a universally funny movie that doesn't alienate anyone in the audience who hasn't seen The Room.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is more about circumstance and the unexpected virtues of vanity projects than it is about who the people at its center really are. It still comes off as a wildly entertaining ride -- and one I'd happily take again.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist finds James Franco and brother Dave Franco homaging the world's worst movie with one of their bests.|Fresh
"Eventually wants to posit the ironic enthusiasm of The Room's midnight-movie fandom as a kind of ""validating moment"" for Wiseau and company - in effect, congratulating its makers and stars for being fans of The Room."|Fresh
The Room endures because there's nothing quite like it, and The Disaster Artist presents a delightful portrait of why the cult classic has absolutely no peers in the world of so-bad-it's-good cinema.|Fresh
Leave it to one of the most notorious 'best worst movies' to inspire something so entertaining.|Fresh
The film sticks the landing and provides a funny and sincere look at the making of The Room as well as the relationship between Wiseau and Sestero. But enough about that. Anyway, how's your sex lives?|Fresh
This is a hollow and condescending exercise that invites you to poke fun at something that was only fleetingly funny on an ironic level.|Rotten
Franco could have easily just played Wiseau's eccentricities for laughs, but he sheds a little light on the man, making the audience care about him.|Fresh
What begins as something so unfathomably absurd and truly hilarious becomes a surprisingly moving portrait of one man's unwavering love of filmmaking.|Fresh

After The Big Sick and Lady Bird, here is another remarkable tutorial for life delivered through the most outstanding of personalities and the most compact of films.|Fresh

"The Room falls under the category of ""so bad it's good."" The Disaster Artist, directed by James Franco, looks to capture everything that went wrong, and a few things that miraculously went right."|Fresh
More than a mere impersonation, Franco invests Wiseau with a na√Øve vulnerability that makes this potentially horrifying and definitely deluded would-be artist into a sympathetic human being desperate to share his art with the world.|Fresh
As a meta commentary on the misunderstood visionary, The Disaster Artist is a triumph. Yes, it's another of Franco's earnest forays, but this one works because it's so deeply personal.|Fresh
With solid direction and great performances from himself and the rest of his cast, this cinematic love letter to the best-worst movie ever made is one of the best of the year.|Fresh
I was simply struck by how lucky one wealthy, self-centered maniac got by gaining so much notoriety for something so lame. I think he inadvertently expressed something so raw and naked that it becomes watchable on another level.|Fresh
Overstays its welcome, and overplays the notion that Wiseau, though a chump, represents the true spirit of Hollywood dreams, but plenty of amusing moments.|Fresh
Along with being endlessly funny, this film is a singular look at the debilitating cycles of rejection, and the ways in which a life-long villain can look like a hero when peacocking in the right light.|Fresh
It is a bit odd to have such warm and fuzzy feelings about a film based on The Room, but there is a certain degree of affection for it.|Fresh
[The Disaster Artist] brings heart to a side of Tommy Wiseau and his fellow filmmakers that is not talked about enough...|Fresh
The result is one heck of a blast.|Fresh
Keeping the story structure familiar likely acts as a way for the film to stay grounded as it explores its weird subject and you see them coming clearly.|Fresh
The Room is wondrously mindless, whereas The Disaster Artist is just kind of dumb.|Rotten
Like everything James Franco directs, The Disaster Artist is a work of appropriation art.|Rotten
The Disaster Artist is an incredibly entertaining movie, and Franco delivers a rendition of Tommy Wiseau that is award worthy.|Fresh
...an intelligent comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
If the point was to show that Waseau was weird, the creators of this film achieve that point. However, you also have to wonder about the self-indulgence exhibited by James Franco.|Fresh
Overall, 'The Disaster Artist' is a triumph through and through.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is a film absent of substantial dilemmas. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten

[James Franco's] performance is, for long stretches, the most admirable of the film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Funnier than Ed Wood and costarring James' brother Dave Franco, it's the best buddy picture about bad filmmakers since Boogie Nights.|Fresh
The Franco brothers bring the same creative energy to their project that motivated Wiseau in his own endeavor. The difference is, they have talent.|Fresh
James Franco did a great job directing and starring in the movie...you appreciate the general mannerisms he has. He's not Daniel Day-Lewis, but he did a really good job.|Fresh
As an actor, Franco effectively appropriated the tics of the one-man-orchestra Wiseau, but the comedy ends on the side of condescension and the punishment of others. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten

Extremely entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A satirical look at bad filmmaking that is itself bad filmmaking. . .Wiseau and Sestero are both pitied and ridiculed. . .The Disaster Artist is being bizarrely acclaimed, proof that the idea of art has died in Hollywood.|Rotten
A desperate love letter to cinema that puts the stupidity and nonsense of many of our dreams right before our eyes. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is a comedy that is frequently laugh-out-loud funny. But it is also sympathetic towards Wiseau's insatiable desire to create, to find fame.|Fresh
There's a clear fondness for the subject matter here, a respect for the protagonists that goes beyond caricature, and an unexpected poignancy to the challenges.|Fresh
This is the kind of stranger-than-fiction gold that gets crazier the deeper you delve into it.|Fresh
James Franco brings out a moving 'bromance' from 'The Room' while celebrating the creative impulse over talent. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...large swaths of The Disaster Artist completely fail to completely capture and sustain one's interest...|Rotten
"The Disaster Artist unfortunately takes Wiseau as seriously as he took himself during the filming of The Room, but at least it provides some insight as to why the ""worst movie"" ever made was created."|Fresh
The built-in level of affection and support between the two siblings lends the movie an extra layer of heart that helps keep The Disaster Artist from being the condescending hatchet job it could have become in many other directors' hands.|Fresh

The Disaster Artist is arguably the most unlikely film about film-making in recent memory...resulting in one of the best comedies of the year.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist might just usher in the golden era of Tommy Wiseau. Naaht a bad film at all.|Fresh
It's a hilarious and at times heartwarming film about the lengths people will go to achieve their wildest dreams.|Fresh
This is the year's funniest film. I suspect that the more you know about how films are really made, the funnier this film will seem to you, and vice versa.|Fresh
A thoughtful, deeply humorous portrait of a man who wanted to make a movie in spite of the cynicism of others, and did so entirely on his terms - in this case, for far worse results than most.|Fresh
A very trivial and insubstantial character study.|Rotten
Franco feels the same affection and respect for Tommy that the tandem Tim Burton/Johnny Depp have for Ed Wood. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film alternates between embracing the individual viewer and the collective appreciation of bad, bad art, and while we are often laughing uproariously at the audacity of the story unfolding, there are moments of sadness where we fear we shouldn't.|Fresh
Anger and self-pity practically bleed off the screen in The Room, but The Disaster Artist only hints at what could have inspired such animus.|Fresh
"The movie condenses the complicated Wiseau-Sestero relationship into a broad ""two friends take on Hollywood"" narrative, robbing the story of so many of its eccentricities."|Rotten
Oxymoronic, Oscar-quality acting that's simultaneously godawful!|Fresh
The success of The Disaster Artist is less a thoughtful almost-adaptation and more a testament to one man and his quest for greatness - even if it means being the worst of the best.|Fresh
It feels unhealthily backward-looking to allow Franco to elevate Wiseau to a hero worth rooting for.|Rotten
Even viewers who haven't see The Room should be able to relate to this affectionate real-life shaggy-dog tale about dreamers, set in the shadow of Hollywood.|Fresh
The fiercely clever casting alone makes it worth the price of admission, but this is also the kind of movie that makes us fall in in love with cinema all over again. And it'll make you less afraid to admit your guilty pleasures.|Fresh
James Franco has made a wickedly funny and very good movie from the ruins of one of the worst ever made.|Fresh
It doesn't matter if you've seen The Room or not. You'll be laughing regardless at this truth is stranger than fiction tale.|Fresh
"Instead of being consistently funny, much of the film is downright cringeworthy. As a cautionary tale, ""The Disaster Artist"" succeeds, but as a comedy, it's more disturbing and subversive than a laugh riot."|Rotten
When Franco and Rogen show up in something together, good things tend to happen.|Fresh
Stacking the cast with a This is the End-style comedy ensemble, only to have them sit around commenting on Wisseau's follies like they were guests on a podcast, exposes the smugness at the movie's core.|Fresh
A wild true story about obsessively chasing a dream, finding a friend and yearning to belong, this Ed Wood-style effort will make you want to hurl spoons at the screen with sheer joy.|Fresh
Franco's film is disappointing and more than a little patronizing.|Rotten
The Disaster Artist is directed by James Franco, who also stars as Wiseau in a performance of fascinating weirdness.|Fresh
Please savor the irony that one of the worst movies ever made has inspired one of the best movies of 2017.|Fresh
As I laughed at The Disaster Artist, there's still a hint of sourness to the proceedings that made me feel crappy afterwards.It's easy to see that everyone involved has great affection for The Room, but I'm not sure that love carries over to Wiseau.|Rotten
Here's an enjoyable account of the daffy behind-the-scenes goings-on during the filming of the cult film 'The Room.'|Fresh
As with Ed Wood, which paid tribute to the director of Plan 9 From Outer Space - another film that does not deserve its reputation as one of the worst ever made - The Disaster Artist champions the value of persistence in the face of all odds.|Fresh
We may never know exactly what was going on in Tommy Wiseau's mind when he created one of the worst movies ever made, but The Disaster Artist is a valiant attempt at understanding just that.|Fresh
Franco leaves flattery behind and finds the authenticity of this man, pointing the way to a real shot at critical redemption for Wiseau and The Room.|Fresh
It's entertaining, if framed and cut a touch manically.|Fresh
The irony is that this farcical comedy just might win the Oscar Wiseau always coveted. I'm sure Wiseau will take credit for it if it happens. And we won't mind.|Fresh
James Franco and the entire Disaster Artist team have created a modern fable. Someone who went for their dream achieved it in the most unlikely way possible. We can all relate.|Fresh
That sunnier-than-truth finale suits The Disaster Artist's relentlessly cockeyed optimism. Franco doesn't ask viewers to reconsider bad art but to respect the artist behind it.|Fresh
The spiritual companion piece to Ed Wood, The Disaster Artist is another cheerful Hollywood-insider piece about a man whose ambitions far outweigh his expertise.|Fresh
Although the humour is Marmite, the story is good.|Fresh
Franco's portrayal of him is brilliant: obscured by prosthetics and that impenetrable accent, he digs deep into Tommy's complex and by no means unsympathetic personality, and never makes the mistake of letting his character in on the joke.|Fresh
The film is still just an ironist freak show, albeit one now enacted by Franco and his celebrity friends.|Rotten
The Disaster Artist is an endearing tale of friendship and chasing your dreams that packs a surprisingly poignant punch.|Fresh
The funniest bad movie ever made becomes a mildly amusing celebrity piss take with a few moments of shoe-horned conflict and plastic pathos.|Rotten
Director and star James Franco simply gets how to make a good film in equal measure to the ineptitude of Tommy Wiseau, whose classically bad movie becomes the subject of this very funny one.|Fresh
James Franco -- as we've never seen him before -- steals the show playing Tommy Wiseau in 'The Disaster Artist,' based on a true story.|Fresh
Good news, everyone: We found the role that James Franco was born to play.|Fresh
"Not ""only"" a good movie within a movie. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Unlike its bosom buddy, Tim Burton's Ed Wood, it might be too niche a subject to resonate with mass audiences but it's evident Franco and crew are having a whale of a time.|Fresh
What do 'The Room' and The Disaster Artist have in common? An absolute dearth of insincerity.|Fresh
What distinguishes The Disaster Artist is that it celebrates drive and, much like an episode of American Pickers, turns trash into treasure.|Fresh
Franco's performance as Wiseau is an extreme, frightening, hair-tearingly bizarre and almost always hilarious feat of daring.|Fresh
Franco clearly has a whale of a time with Wiseau's punch-drunk accent, bizarre mannerisms and dada laugh; it's a staggering piece of mimicry.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist proves through its onslaught of ludicrous scenarios, that truth can sometimes be much stranger than fiction.|Fresh
Perhaps this one is just for the die-hard fans, burning to know how such a bad film was ever brought to life. Clearly, I'm not one of them.|Rotten
Taking a cue from Ed Wood, this loving portrait of a terrible filmmaker could have indulged in ridicule, but instead it's about passion and dedication.|Fresh
Why The Disaster Artist works so well is that it doesn't judge our reactions to it; the film is not in the slightest ironic or, as is fashionable these days, meta.|Fresh
"""The Disaster Artist,"" James Franco's charming love letter to one of the most fabulously awful movies ever, earns ""Hi Marks,"" indeed."|Fresh
I don't know if The Disaster Artist will rock your world, but I do know that I laughed at the comic touches that Franco, who also directed, brings to the subject of dismal failure.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist will remind of The Producers in places but there is another great movie that it also brings to mind - in Hollywood terms, it is the equivalent of This is Spinal Tap.|Fresh
"""The Disaster Artist,"" despite all its Hollywood cynicism, has quite a big heart."|Fresh
Seth Rogen steals the show as Sandy Schklair, a continuity expert who seems to be the only person involved with The Room who knows how a set or even real life works.|Fresh
It's difficult to cheer on Wiseau as an anti-hero when it's not clear exactly what, other than a vehicle for his own narcissism, he was championing.|Rotten
The Disaster Artist is an enormously entertaining look at film making dreams and the legacy that comes with making a truly terrible one.|Fresh
"Like Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood,"" ""The Room"" is both a movie that pokes fun at its subject and celebrates it, with an odd but strangely inspiring message: Do what you love. Even if you're terrible at it."|Fresh
"James Franco's story about filmmaker Tommy Wiseau, his friendship with aspiring actor Greg Sestero and Wiseau's making of his film, ""The Room,"" is funny, creepy and a most singular experience."|Fresh
Wiseau, The Room and the making of a celluloid catastrophe are the subjects of The Disaster Artist, a fabulous, strange and frequently hilarious comedy-drama from the self-styled polymath James Franco.|Fresh
"Some familiarity with ""The Room"" certainly enhances the humor here, but ""The Disaster Artist"" delivers its own inspired, often hysterical comedy."|Fresh
It's a benign salute to a midnight melodrama.|Fresh
As with Ed Wood, its nearest cinematic neighbour, you don't need to have seen its subject's work to get the surprisingly sweet-toned humour that comes mostly at a pseudo-auteur's expense.|Fresh
It might not be as amusing as discovering the mind-boggling awfulness of The Room for the first time, but it's a decent intro to the madness.|Fresh
If you strip the fiddly premise out, this is an immensely silly movie about an immensely silly person. Watch it. You'll be glad you did.|Fresh
It's smart and funny and knowing, and is propelled by a strong cast led by Franco himself and his brother Dave.|Fresh
[The Disaster Artist] will surprise you at exactly the moment you think you've got it figured out.|Fresh
The key to The Disaster Artist and Franco's success: he finds the heart and soul of the film. It's not difficult to predict what those things are, ultimately, but there will be no spoilers here. Go see it.|Fresh
While it doesn't match the brilliance of 'Ed Wood,' it's a mightily enjoyable, and equally affectionate, tribute to a misguided moviemaker.|Fresh
"If The Room is the ""Citizen Kane of bad movies,"" as it has notoriously been tagged, then The Disaster Artist, the story of the making of that film, is the shaggy-dog redemption story that it deserves."|Fresh
Disaster Artist is... a consistently funny film that has enough warmth to make it an ode to both friendship and the artistic spirit, in whatever direction they may take.|Fresh
Being able to avert disasters along the way in the service of capturing the nuances of interpersonal relationships is their artistic calling.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist should definitely first be seen in the theater, with a raucous crowd roaring with laughter. But later it should be seen at home where you can also observe the film's sneaky empathy and grace.|Fresh
"Like Tim Burton's classic ""Ed Wood,"" ""The Disaster Artist"" is a testament to the communal joy of movie-making. But more than that, it's an unforgettable appreciation of the pleasures of movie-watching."|Fresh
Both The Room and The Disaster Artist prove exceptions to the old adage that you can't polish a turd: while Wiseau saw his 'disasterpiece' evolve beyond his imagining, Franco, for his part, has spun tragicomic gold from the most tragic of base materials.|Fresh
"""The Disaster Artist"" is a lot of fun, even if some of it is uncomfortable. And of course it's way better than ""The Room."""|Fresh
This movie isn't just some Hollywood parody or inside joke. It takes Wiseau's humanity seriously and portrays him as a wounded individual who wanted to be an All-American James Dean-type hero and not the ogre or villain everyone else saw him as.|Fresh
Sincere and sporadically funny, The Disaster Artist is an endearing tribute to failing in Hollywood. Anyway, how is your sex life?|Fresh
It's The Room with a view from people with talent, sniggering with a veneer of generosity to save face.|Fresh
It'd be an absolute tragedy if it wasn't so funny...|Fresh
Funny and alarmingly factual.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist really hangs on James Franco's performance. He's an uncanny mimic of Wiseau's legendary accent and mannerisms, but what he really nails is Wiseau's complete lack of self-awareness.|Fresh
A fascinating glimpse into the genesis of one of Hollywood's worst releases and is worthy of a space alongside Ed Wood on the shelf for dreamers who succeeded because of a lack of self-awareness and an epic void of talent.|Fresh
... it is the enduring, infectiously unsettling weirdness of Tommy Wiseau which ultimately delivers one of the most amusing comedies of 2017.|Fresh
Like the hilariously inept melodrama of The Room itself, Tommy Wiseau offers Franco a gold mine of oddities.|Fresh
"""The Room,"" a movie that had audiences laughing AT the director is transformed into a laugh-out-loud film that has us laughing WITH the director."|Fresh
Superficially slick, yet schlocky, a muddled misadventure...|Rotten
Don't expect much new information to come to light if you've already read Sestero's book on which the film was based, though; despite a bravura performance from James Franco, Wiseau remains as inscrutable as ever.|Fresh
The side-by-side comparisons during the ending credits will leave you speechless if you're magically not already dead from laughing|Fresh
Imbued with his own divisive but wholly vivid personal mythology, James Franco is just as important character to The Disaster Artist as Tommy is.|Fresh
A good, shallow movie about a bad, shallow movie... Funny and highly energized.|Fresh
one of the year's best|Fresh
A hilarious ode to talentless passion. James Franco gives the bizarre Tommy Wiseau depth without solving his mystery, but skips a deserved zing at Hollywood.|Fresh
Franco gets credit for focusing every bit as much on the artist as the disaster - and for taking something most saw as trash and spinning it into something close to treasure.|Fresh
Franco plays this fascinating outsider with a cheeky wink, making for a very funny character study of a man who marched to the beat of his own drum.|Fresh
James Franco shows less conviction than his muse, Tommy Wiseau.|Rotten
Even if you've never heard of The Room, what James Franco has to offer here a fantastic, hilarious true Hollywood story that is as phenomenal as its subject matter is awful.|Fresh
James Franco's all-over-the-place career hits its sweet spot with his hugely entertaining recreation of one Hollywood hopeful's master class in how not to make a movie.|Fresh
The comedy, for all its scenes of giddy wonder, never gets past Tommy's mask of mystery; avoiding speculation and investigation, it stays on the surface of his public and private shtick, leaving little more than a trail of amusing anecdotes.|Rotten
The most surprising aspect about this singular movie about a singular individual is its universal entertainment value.|Fresh
A great film and one of the must-sees for award season.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is an indulgent salute to the cockeyed dreamers of the film world and softens its ridicule with a good measure of affection.|Fresh
This is a film with heart as well as humour.|Fresh
"James Franco hits all the right wrong notes in this hugely entertaining, true-life tale of Tommy Wiseau's 2003 ""disasterpiece"" film The Room."|Fresh
Tommy Wiseau is flat-out weird, even a tad scary, but Franco seldom fails to make his character's acute form of self-delusion charming and infectious.|Fresh
Sorry, must disagree with majority. This film is a frequently too boring film about boorish filmmaker with a lot of mystery money, Maybe as a five minute SNL skit. But as a feature, it's a drag.|Rotten
Hilarious... the film may be the best use to date of James Franco's off-kilter energy|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is a study in empathy and this year's darker, grittier answer to La La Land, peddling as it does in the dreams of Angeleno artists.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist has all the fascination of a train wreck and will be essential viewing for anyone at all interested in the current status of the film industry.|Fresh
Fans of The Room will find much to love here, but even if you've never heard of it, The Disaster Artist should delight.|Fresh
It's a professional and personal triumph for the reinvigorated Franco.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist misses its shot at greatness but it is still an enormously entertaining work that serves as a celebration of the artistic process.|Fresh
Even more impressively, Franco makes Wiseau, maybe the most unpleasant character he's ever played, someone you genuinely root for in his demented quest for greatness.|Fresh
As a filmmaker, Franco has often tended toward high or performance art... The Disaster Artist allows for both these Francos to shine.|Fresh
By channeling his inner Tommy Wiseau, James Franco manages to craft an intentional comedic sensation out of an unintentionally hilarious failure, The Disaster Artist rising to a level of genuine greatness that's astonishing.|Fresh
Entertaining enough but increasingly repetitive as it goes. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Franco creates this heightened reality, almost like you've stepped into Bizarro World, where you're cheering for Tommy's movie to be as terrible as it possibly can be.|Fresh
A broad, winning adaptation of a fantastic book.|Fresh
Perhaps the greatest compliment one can pay Franco's The Disaster Artist is that it encourages audiences to laugh with Wiseau and his clueless cohorts rather than mock them.|Fresh
When I saw the end of this bizarre movie, I realized that I enjoyed it more than I thought I had. The additional few scenes shown after fade-out are pretty amazing and eye-opening. In fact it was those scenes that raised my rating considerably.|Fresh
Franco transforms Sestero's BTS memoir into a genuinely touching tale of two outsiders.|Fresh
The point is well taken - that both projects unapologetically deserve a place in the cinematic landscape, quality be damned.|Fresh
I can certainly imagine a director emerging from a screening of The Room filled with the fear that he's been making the same kind of movie this whole time. Maybe it just took a terrible movie to finally inspire James Franco to direct a good one.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is a movie that supplements an excellent film and an entertaining book while not quite hitting either's mark, but it is entertaining.|Fresh
A galaxy of great guest stars adds comic coats of appalled disbelief as Tommy makes his movie every wrong way he possibly can - while Franco, off-camera, makes one of the weirdest and best films about a movie ever.|Fresh
It's also a reminder that Franco is a smart and funny performer with perverse comedic instincts that pay off constantly.|Fresh
By the end of The Disaster Artist, Wiseau is still a joke.|Rotten
Like watching a meme come to life.|Fresh
Not a lot unlike watching The Room itself...|Fresh
Franco's very funny movie meticulously re-creates The Room's most famously botched scenes, but shies away from its tortured soul.|Fresh
Funny, heartfelt and utterly bizarre.|Fresh
Franco gives Wiseau and his story the film he was not able to give himself.|Fresh
It's one of the best, touching and funniest films you'll see this year - Franco will have some way to go before he can top this one.|Fresh
On its own terms, The Disaster Artist is a funny movie.|Fresh
On one level it functions as a useful demolition job on the artist-as-savant myth that too many films and documentaries indulge, but on another it's a reminder that even bad art can spring from and inspire compelling human stories.|Fresh
Without the endorsement of real life, The Disaster Artist would tell a story far too weird to believe.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist has broad appeal because it's not just about making a movie, it's about believing in yourself against all odds.|Fresh
"So, to see the machinations behind it - the never-ending takes, the adding of the water bottle, Wiseau's commitment to ""real human behavior"" - gives depth to what, on the surface, appears purely trash."|Fresh
Franco follows the model of Tim Burton's biopic Ed Wood, approaching Wiseau with a delicate balance of affectionate mockery and a heartfelt appreciation for his creative passion.|Fresh
The old alchemist's trick of turning lead into gold has nothing on The Disaster Artist, a film that masters the trickier feat of transforming trash into art.|Fresh
There's something joyful about the Franco brothers playing a fun-house mirror version of their own Hollywood arrival, and the film's best scenes are with Rogen's production manager, aghast at Tommy's incompetence.|Fresh
The film is ... funny -- hilarious at points -- and an enlightening look at the production of one of the most infamous movies ever made.|Fresh
"Behind the camera is really where Franco flourishes, as there's a pace to ""The Disaster Artist"" that makes up it for its occasionally uneven and clunky structure."|Fresh
"Mr. Franco recreates the production of ""The Room"" - and the escalating behind-the-scenes nuttiness - with an assured, energetic touch ..."|Fresh
"Spelling out a joke may be the quickest way to kill it, but the obvious, expository nature of the mockery in ""The Disaster Artist"" doesn't make it any less funny or illuminating."|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is a truly, profoundly funny film. But it is also something more. There's a poignancy here and an insight into the necessary self-delusion that it takes to even imagine becoming a successful actor or film-maker.|Fresh
It's a film to see with an audience familiar with what it's about to see, with people who can appreciate the dedication with which Franco and co. have recreated so many of the original film's woeful scenes and performances.|Fresh
"There's a nagging feeling we should expect something more from this guy. To borrow the most quotable line of dialogue from The Room (bellowed at the top of the lungs): ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, FRANCO!"""|Fresh
"In a kooky yet vulnerable and heartfelt performance, Franco gets right at the heart of what makes Wiseau a true hero - his sheer willingness to try - and that is what makes ""The Disaster Artist"" work so well."|Fresh
"""The Disaster Artist"" is a breezy, entertaining and even affectionate movie about the making of ""The Room."""|Fresh
Perhaps Franco's two decades of r√©sum√© mongering has all along been in the service of harnessing the real freak he had inside all along.|Fresh
Both the book and the movie try to explain what makes The Room such a phenomenon, but Franco loses patience and takes a scalpel to the story.|Rotten
James Franco's very funny The Disaster Artist is possibly the best narrative film about an outsider filmmaker since Tim Burton's Ed Wood, and it's anchored by three wise choices.|Fresh
Given his own failed attempts at becoming an auteur, it is all too perfect that James Franco finally finds his muse, successfully humanizing one of cinema's few genuine eccentrics.|Fresh
The real genius of The Disaster Artist is its understanding of anti-genius.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is still approximately 783 times better than the film it's lampooning. Intoxicating fun, it deserves to be on a double bill with The Room whenever the so-called 'Citizen Kane of bad movies' is shown.|Fresh
(James Franco's) team did a terrific job with the re-creation, and The Disaster Artist is a fun look at Hollywood dreams at their woolliest.|Fresh

The Disaster Artist -- James Franco's hyphenated turn as star, producer and director -- deftly falls into that comedic pantheon, joining the likes of Ed Wood in making an entertaining movie about a truly terrible one.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist is funny from the beginning, but it becomes downright side-splitting once Tommy gets onto a film set.|Fresh
What Franco's performance brings out is a sense of emotional pain that's perhaps not obvious in the real Tommy Wiseau.|Fresh
It's a nice irony that one of the worst movies in recent history has enabled James Franco to make one of the best films in his own chequered career.|Fresh
A perfect recreation of Wiseau's very imperfect creation, and a celebration of anybody who ever made art - no matter how egregious.|Fresh
For something based around such an extraordinary phenomenon and involving such a remarkable real person, the film is ultimately rather ordinary and unoriginal.|Rotten
An ode to gloriously terrible filmmaking, with Franco turning in perhaps his best performance to date.|Fresh
An audacious high-wire act, a quirky tribute to outsiders everywhere and a celebration of a particularly bizarre moment in Hollywood-outsider footnote history.|Fresh

Whatever my queasiness about laughing at a head case, I couldn't help myself from thrilling to Franco's timing, his relish, his swan dive into an egotism that has no bottom.|Fresh
Director James Franco's enjoyable ode to the creative process - any creative process, really. It's also one of Franco's strongest roles as an actor, capturing every little quirk and quality of a definite eccentric.|Fresh
James Franco has turned one of the worst movies ever made into a great one. That's not merely the result of hard graft, skill and luck. That's straight-up alchemy.|Fresh
The Disaster Artist, which Franco directed and stars in, has to be one of the best and sweetest and funniest films about failure I've ever seen.|Fresh

James Franco goes behind the scenes of The Room, a legend in its own right, and offers some of his best work yet in The Disaster Artist.|Fresh

Franco remains one of the most fascinating performers of his generation, even if his directing ability needs a little work.|Fresh
What could have been a parody, evolves into a touching celebration of the man behind the worst movie ever made. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Inhabiting Wiseau's skin gives [James Franco] liberty to be as weird as he wants to be and it completely works. Even when Tommy's actions seem cruel, Franco's interpretation brims with sympathy.|Fresh
