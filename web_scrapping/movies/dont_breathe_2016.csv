Alvarez isn't afraid to wear his genre influences on his sleeve, and the results are genuine and unforced.|Fresh
There were a few times where it really got me good, and I was grabbing my face.|Fresh
It keeps you guessing throughout the running time, and has fun playing with the audience's expectations.|Fresh
After I walked out of the theater, every sound seemed louder and scarier; I saw images from this film when I closed my eyes.|Fresh
Dumb horror is its own specific flavor, and... it's rare these days for a particularly effective example to come along. This is one of those.|Fresh
More of a thriller than a horror movie, but I dig it none the less.|Fresh
Lang's work here is physically impressive and justifiably evil-so much more striking than his performance as the scarfaced villain in Avatar.|Fresh
It truly is a shame that as the year winds down and the Academy begins handing out their Oscar nominations, Stephen Lang's performance won't even be looked at because the film is essentially a horror film with little dramatic substance|Fresh
It's fantastic. Go watch it.|Fresh
You can easily compare Don't Breathe to thriller horror classics like Psycho, Old Boy and Vertigo.|Fresh
This is a film about agency - embracing it or denying someone of their own - and both the consequences of the choices we actively make as well as the evolving rationalizations we create to live with ourselves.|Fresh
A movie that made me hold my breath more than once, and managed to take suspense to heights most modern horror movies don't even bother with anymore.|Fresh
Don't breathe is one of the most intelligent films of the year, one that from the angle of horror, invites the audience to perform reflexive exercises around morality and justification of the lowest human action. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An excellent addition to the genre of horror thanks to the presentation of its narrative, visual and sound proposal. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Easily one of the most assured and immersive horror films in recent memory.|Fresh
Those underdeveloped characters become more of a problem when the plot starts to run into the realm of the indestructible bad guy and a shocking twist I found lazy and in poor taste (even in this realm).|Rotten
Even the recurring passages of pin-drop silence generate edge-of-the-seat dread.|Fresh
A suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse develops where a creaky floorboard is the difference between life and death. Lang makes an intimidating antagonist, but a silly final act ends things on a sour note.|Fresh
Terrific, taut, dry-throated thriller...|Fresh
It's a decent piece of schlock suspense with enough thrills to shake the popcorn out of the box.|Fresh
Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Don't Breathe keeps the terror going until the very end, but it takes a lot of liberties with credibility, even for the genre.|Fresh
The best and most violent in the HOME ALONE series.|Fresh
'Tis pity that such a well-honed thriller should take place around such a vacuous center.|Rotten
Don't Breathe is interlaced with moments of terrifying brilliance and grounded in primal scares that demand your attention.|Fresh
Fede Alvarez is the real deal|Fresh
A supremely well-crafted film.|Fresh
...relies on some outlandish plot twists to amp up the ickiness.|Fresh
Don't Breathe mines much of its tension from its claustrophobic setting, with doors closed and dogs released on the intruders. (It also recalls indie horror It Follows in its desolate Detroit location.)|Fresh
Works wonders with claustrophobia, tension, startling action, and in taking the home invasion film and giving it a unique twist.|Fresh
Don't Breathe shows once again that Alvarez is a competent filmmaker when it comes to directing, but thanks to a script riddled with plotholes and idiotic characters, it's clear that he and Sayagues still have a lot of work to do when it comes to writing.|Rotten
It will have you gasping with terror.|Fresh
Alvarez has a real talent for building tension and, in the young Levy, may have found the perfect acting foil for his particular brand of atmospheric horror.|Fresh
I never feel totally comfortable watching a movie in which the heroine is punched repeatedly in the face, in wide shot, by a muscle-bound psychopath until she blacks out.|Rotten
There is no doubt that Alvarez has a knack for creating effective framing devices, and the movie is chock-full of good suspense.|Fresh
"A ""home invasion"" film that, even though it has some of the typical elements of suspense films, some twists and details that make it work completely despite the familiarity. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
There's no excuse for the film's vile misogyny, even if violence against women is a staple ingredient of such films.|Rotten
A thriller that manipulates the viewer loyalty with the characters, reversing the traditional roles in films that revolve around home invasions: you can't be sure that the invaders are guilty or that the overrun is a victim. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A neat film, crudely accurate and intelligent. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An atmospheric, claustrophobic and undeniably intense horror thriller. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A nasty little addition to the minor 2016 horror boom, Don't Breathe tops up its surfeit of straight-forward jump scares with an impressively disgusting third-act reveal.|Fresh

It's hard to care much what happens to any of the highly unsympathetic cast.|Rotten

If you're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of the seat biting your nails, this is the one. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Plot and character quibbles aside, there's doubting Alvrarez's taste for horror. But, while you might hold your breath while watching, Don't Breathe probably won't give you any lasting nightmares.|Fresh
Alvarez, take a bow. You sick freak.|Fresh
To reveal any more plot-wise would spoil your immersion in a movie that has nods to the masters but still manages to deliver real terror from the tropes and has a few tricks up its sleeve too.|Fresh

Filled with moments of gripping suspense, uneasy stillness and gut-wrenching silence, Don't Breathe is a surprisingly entertaining entry into the home-invasion subgenre.|Fresh

An intensely satisfying thriller packed with undeniable tension and shocking surprises.|Fresh
[A] taut, appropriately breath-stealing new movie that galvanizes the tired home invasion subgenre of horror the way films like The Witch and It Follows have done for the coven and slasher subgenres.|Fresh
Don't Breathe is physically punishing in its relentless ratcheting of tension, an absolute masterclass in horror film making with virtually not an ounce of fat on it.|Fresh
A film that achieved the category of cult classic for being one of the most amazing and creative horror movies of the last years. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Connoisseurs of cruelty will sweat, squirm and relish every mean, masochistic minute of it.|Fresh
"Here is a reminder of why the torture porn genre died off after the second installment in the ""Human Centipede"" franchise."|Rotten
This is a pretty stupid movie.|Rotten
Don't Breathe has a tense atmosphere with a good pay off. Stephen Lang is a mincing presence and we root to see Rocky and her friends survive. Don't Breathe is good for a fun night out.|Fresh
This is not a gore-fest like Evil Dead. It's a tight film about people messed up by the ordinary world and what happens when they walk further down the wrong path -- and collide.|Fresh
Far and away the best horror film of the year, Don't Breathe makes a little go a long, long way.|Fresh
With Don't Breathe it's not just the characters on the screen who'll find themselves holding their breath.|Fresh
The script generally relies on manipulation in order to get everything to play out.|Rotten
Don't Breathe is a beast of a movie - it's tight, relentlessly thrilling, fiendishly clever, and for its audience, it's one of the most satisfying films of the year.|Fresh
Jane Levy delivers an emotionally exhausting performance while this chillingly hair-rising spotlight shines down on Stephen Lang. Don't Breathe is a fiercely brutal plunge down the rabbit hole. Home invasion films won't see it coming.|Fresh
...an adrenaline rush of a film, a taut 88-minute thrill ride.|Fresh
'Don't Breathe' is an amazing and very entertaining horror film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Alvarez treats his deaths the way fine dining restaurants dole out portions: Less is more, because each item on your plate is divine to the palate, assuming that uncontrollably squirming in your seat is to your taste.|Fresh
This is one for horror diehards -- well-engineered, but not on a par with Jeremy Saulnier'​s grimy Green Room or Dan Trachtenberg'​s zany 10 Cloverfield Lane.|Fresh
Fede Alvarez's follow-up to his splatterific Evil Dead remake is further proof that he's one of the most brilliant genre directors around.|Fresh
...a riveting, white-knuckle ride, and a cracking good time at the movies.|Fresh
A good movie from a smart director that knew what to do with his resources and a short script. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A terrifying story that could be based on true events, full of suffocating silences and unexpected twists. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A routine teen horror flick takes on a life of its own.|Fresh
"The film suffocates viewers with its sound mix and mind-bendingly stupid story developments that not even the most gullible ""Friday The 13th"" victim would enact."|Rotten
the setting in the decaying emptiness of a largely deserted suburban Detroit neighborhood gives the horror thriller an atmospheric sense of loss, abandonment, and desperation that greatly enhances its relatively rote trapped-in-a-house narrative|Fresh

Don't Breathe will keep you on the edge of your seat, doing what the title proposes: holding your breathe alongside the main characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A smart and twisted breath of fresh air for a sub-genre at risk of growing stale.|Fresh
Don't Breathe is destined to battle it out with the likes of Green Room and 10 Cloverfield Lane for the title of Top Hollywood Fright Flick of 2016.|Fresh
Don't Go.|Rotten
If you like the horror genre, this is for you. It's scary, so inhale deeply, exhale slowly - and expect a sequel.|Fresh
A work of fine craftsmanship.|Fresh
A thoughtfully crafted addition to the genre.|Fresh
"The stylish, severe Don't Breathe is one of the most cruel and clever, yet electrifying, horror-thriller movies in an age of ""going there"" versus ""going there."""|Fresh
For Alvarez and Sayagues, the film is additional proof these are two guys who know their stuff, and watching them continue to work over the coming years is likely going to prove to be a real, delectably frightening treat indeed.|Fresh
Issues aside, Don't Breathe is sure to become a horror classic.|Fresh
There are enough surprises and scares to keep everyone uncomfortable, and that's a very good thing.|Fresh
This is the kind of film that just makes you nuts for ninety minutes, which is the highest compliment it can be paid.|Fresh
Don't Breathe cuts a fresh path, providing thrill-seeking moviegoers and horror die-hards with an inventive as well as terrifying movie experience.|Fresh
If Fede Alvarez's revisit of Sam Raimi's spooky old cabin in the deep, dark, twisted woods of rural America did something for you in 2013's Evil Dead, then you need to know that Alvarez is back ... this is one sick puppy.|Fresh
A tense, edge of your seat crackerjack thriller. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Alvarez's mean-spirited brand of horror is fearlessly gruesome, that doesn't make it satisfying - or even all that scary.|Rotten
"Not only one of the most novel ""home invasion"" movies you'll ever see, but easily one of the best horror flicks of the year."|Fresh
Giving a twist to the haunted house thriller, Don't Breathe earns its startling scares and deathly chills in a creepy, isolated Detroit home surrounded by abandoned buildings and empty streets.|Fresh
... produces more cheap thrills than consistent suspense, and it fails to generate much sympathy for its dim-witted protagonists.|Rotten
The first three-quarters of this simple, intense thriller are something close to masterful -- and then it goes a little too over the top, with an outlandish reveal and elements of torture and gore.|Fresh
Slick and nasty in a way that prevents it from being pure escapist fun.|Rotten
(Fede) Alvarez uses lengthy stretches of silence to heighten the tension and draw the audience into the hunt.|Fresh
You may walk away with a scarred psyche and enough nightmare material to stock your subconscious up through the winter.|Fresh
A relentlessly violent game of hide-and-seek, much of it joltingly effective, much of it - in the grand horror tradition - amusingly implausible|Fresh
If you're looking for something scary, this is the first great horror film of the spooky season.|Fresh
Succeeds when it doesn't try to be too complicated and conventional.|Rotten
You could treat it as a casual primer on suspense-film craft, or you can just watch through splayed fingers, like the women who sat next to me at the screening I attended.|Fresh
Horror filmmaker Fede Alvarez avoids the fate of the sophomore curse with his second feature film, Don't Breathe, which establishes the director as the real deal when it comes to horror and thrills... and horror.|Fresh
It takes a turn so unpleasant it goes from being mediocre to just plain gross.|Rotten
A very ordinary horror thriller without any shocking twists or surprises. If only the screenplay were half as clever and imaginative as the sound and visual design!|Rotten
Won't have you holding your breath. It has a villain unique enough to separate it from others of its ilk. BTW, the less you know about it before buying a ticket, the better.|Fresh
"Ceaseless in its nail-biting tension and only becoming more breathlessly savage as it goes, ""Don't Breathe"" shreds one's nerves and leaves them for dead. It's easily one of the smartest, most riveting thrillers of the year."|Fresh
"'Don't Breathe' might be the creepiest movie of the year, and that's saying something after the very good ""Green Room"" and ""The Conjuring 2"" both spooked us out earlier."|Fresh
Hits all the marks of a classic. Count on a steady dose of nervous laughter and a sense of dread. And remember the title is a warning for the characters, not the audience.|Fresh
magine if somebody tried to rob blind Zatoichi and he was in a REALLY bad mood and that's the awesomeness you're in store for.|Fresh
Terrific and unsettling horror-thriller. Alvarez is using film to explore his fetishes and he's doing a great job.|Fresh
Don't Breathe does a solid job of dispensing with dialogue in favor of driving the plot via strong, claustrophobic images as the camera snakes in and out of underlit rooms.|Fresh
Deftly directed by Fede Alvarez, Don't Breathe hits the ground running and never slows to take a breath.|Fresh
"Our heroes are compelled to spend so much time skulking around the house quietly that whenever one of them do make a noise, often stupidly, the entire audience groans in unison, as if they're blurting out, ""Hey, blind man, I'm over here!"""|Rotten
Robbery crews are strongly advised to avoid 1837 Buena Vista, but moviegoers hoping for a thrill might like to visit. But don't linger.|Fresh
Alvarez knows the size of his ambitions. He's written one great ghoul, surrounded him with targets, and simply let him let rip.|Fresh
Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues keep the plot twists coming, though as they accumulate the story begins to feel like a confection, succeeding not through any fresh idea but through the stubborn recombination of a few stale ones.|Fresh
Don't Breathe is still a thrilling experience that effectively puts the audience in the protagonists' place: uncertain, cringing, afraid to even breathe because of the potential consequences.|Fresh
Don't Breathe is almost a throwback to older horror films. It's meticulously planned and thrillingly satisfying with a camera always a step ahead.|Fresh
"It will probably please fans of this simple genre with its solid suspense, murky lighting and ""gotcha!"" scares."|Fresh
One of the most suspenseful, terrifying, and devilishly original horror pics in recent memory.|Fresh
Alvarez knows how to build tension, but unfortunately he leans on narrative laziness to accomplish it, threats appearing with no explanation of how they've worked themselves out of their last predicament.|Fresh
This is a tight, tense horror with very little gore on show, relying on suspense to keep the audience on tenterhooks. Expect to see a lot more from Alvarez in future.|Fresh
This is some weird, twisted s--t. Don't groan when I say Don't Breathe is a home-invasion thriller. Director Fede Alvarez is as good as it gets when it comes to playing with things that go bump in the night.|Fresh
Great horror films are feats of direction: Scoff all you like about teenagers getting thrashed by a blind war vet, but it's Alvarez who gets the last laugh.|Fresh
[Stephen Lang] delivers a Pantheon boogeyman here, conveying with every thought and gesture that this is absolutely not a man with whom to screw. This movie should be played loud.|Fresh
"If you're looking for straight-up blood, guts and gore horror, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you're just in the mood for a shockingly good time, don't miss ""Don't Breathe."|Fresh
It's a sharp and savvy thriller for an age in which more than half of Americans seem to feel less secure than ever -- a fear that politicians tend to stoke despite violent crime and violence being down significantly since the '90s.|Fresh
[A]n elaborately staged, finely choreographed game of cat and mouse...|Fresh
[Though] Alvarez proves an adept stager and arranger of calculated shock effects...the script isn't concerned with even an iota of logic, but merely with generating one more empty jolt.|Rotten
"""Don't Breathe"" is simple, but blessedly so, focusing on the procurement of horror and suspense, wasting little of the picture on nonsense."|Fresh
Satisfying, meat-and-potatoes horror that takes a simple premise, adds a couple of flourishes, makes the most of it for 85 minutes, then gets out before it can overstay its welcome.|Fresh
The home invasion thriller Don't Breathe might just be the first movie of the year that'll make you want to do exactly what the title says.|Fresh
"Apart from its thin characters and occasional trite moments, as well as a silly attempt to set up a sequel, ""Don't Breathe"" is just about perfect."|Fresh
How refreshing to see fight scenes that pivot on panicked opportunism rather than martial arts skills or mutant powers.|Fresh
So inventive for its first hour, Don't Breathe strains credulity the longer this goes on. By the time the credits roll, you might find yourself breathing a sigh of relief for all the wrong reasons.|Fresh
There's nothing wrong with crafting a thrill ride, but Alvarez' 'Don't Breathe' eventually goes off the rails as it veers from the exhilarating to the revolting.|Rotten
Alvarez quiets his movie down to a game of cat and mouse, a luxury in a climate in which horror is all about maximum volume.|Fresh
In what is shaping up to a banner year for scary movies, this is another solid and memorable entry.|Fresh
Alvarez serves up some jaw-droppingly tasteless third-act twists to ensure this all sticks. And that's his big mistake.|Rotten
A devious and demonstrative piece of home-invasion mischief that also leans heavily, and ingeniously, on blindness as a crucial plot device.|Fresh
This is a movie where every jump scare is worthy of a shriek.|Fresh
Intriguingly, Don't Breathe plays with the kind of moral relativism that escapes most studio pictures.|Fresh
From the opening shot, the R-rated Don't Breathe drops us into an ominous environment crackling with suspense, jolts and uncertainty about what will happen next.|Fresh
More methodical than innovative, Don't Breathe is nevertheless an effective suspenser.|Fresh
Taps into our deepest, darkest fears, and offers us a bloody, instant horror classic that's not for the faint of heart.|Fresh
"Alvarez, who directed the 2010 remake of Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead,"" effectively sets up a brutal cat-and-mouse game; the problem is that sometimes you don't know who to root for."|Fresh
It's a very effective '90s throwback thriller, where a broken man is robbed by a group of morally bankrupt kids. Have fun deciding which side are heroes and which side are villains.|Fresh
The kind of morality play that toys with audience loyalty and conveys its protagonists' predicament by making us feel claustrophobic right alongside them.|Fresh
A clever if increasingly mechanical suspense contraption, yanking our sympathies this way and that, before turning into a different sort of movie entirely.|Fresh
Three young burglars who think a blind man is easy pickings are in for a surprise in this tense, expertly crafted thriller.|Fresh
A nice little mix tape of a horror movie, incorporating elements of familiar films into something satisfyingly different.|Fresh
Alvarez appears to have consciously toned down the gore from his blood-saturated Evil Dead remake, trusting unnerving visuals and foreshadowing what terrors are about to unfold.|Fresh
Lang, snorting and enormous and bestial, seems like the Minotaur stalking intruders in his deadly labyrinth. For the first hour, the psychological cruelty far outweighs the physical.|Fresh
It leaves the audience in the same place as the characters: gasping for air.|Fresh
What started as an intense, gripping thriller becomes a ridiculous cartoon.|Rotten
While its script could have been written on the back of an envelope, its editing and use of sound design is a triumph.|Fresh
"""One of the most twisted movies you'll see this year."""|Fresh
Connoisseurs of creepy and sometimes brutal chills will have a good time.|Fresh
Don't Breathe makes for a very fun little thriller, though it also veers into being exceptionally stupid or eye-rollingly gross.|Fresh
Once Don't Breathe detonates its big twist...some audience members will feel the film stops being fun while others will feel the fun has started in earnest.|Fresh
The script, by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, steadily and inventively heightens the tension of the break-in and the inevitable hiding and chasing, at least until everything gets ridiculous toward the end.|Fresh
What happens on the screen spreads to the audience. The silence, like the fear, is contagious.|Fresh
While the sight-based conceit offers the opportunity for clever suspense and scares, it's the starkly realistic setting and all too newsworthy themes underpinning the spooky tale that makes the horror of this film so bone-chilling.|Fresh
Director Fede Alvarez is a pro at creating tension with nothing more than sound effects and shots that constantly have us thinking of what's outside the frame.|Fresh
Don't Breathe's sustainment of its corkscrew tension is so elegant and methodical as to feel dance-like.|Fresh
While it is definitely time for Alvarez to stretch beyond his brand of housebound horror, he just may be the current master of it.|Fresh
An intense, streamlined exercise in gruesome thrills, with a tiny glimmer of social context (it's all about the economy) which doesn't take away from the exciting struggle to get out of this house of horrors.|Fresh
The type of edge-of-your seat thrills promised by its commercials, but also takes you into far darker territory than anticipated.|Fresh
DON'T BREATHE works on a primal level with a few shocking surprises along the way.|Fresh
The blind man's house becomes a Rube Goldberg machine of suffering, for just about everybody, and it's a twisted delight to watch that chain of events unfold.|Fresh
Simple, brutal and intense.|Fresh
The ending leaves room for a sequel, but it's not just a half-baked teaser. As with all strong horror stories, the conclusion of one dangerous scenario feeds the fear of more to come.|Fresh
Don't Breathe is a punch to the face, delivering everything you deem tense and thrilling. It's an adrenaline shot of genre-bending ferocity.|Fresh
Don't Breathe indeed reaches a unique destination in horror filmmaking. Unfortunately it fails to deliver a worthy emotional hook to pin its savagery onto.|Rotten
A trapped-in-a-house thriller pitting thieves against an unexpectedly resourceful victim, the lean and mean pic offers scares aplenty and at least a couple of game-changing twists.|Fresh
It's nice to see [Alvarez] flex his filmmaking muscles a bit more independently, and I do hope this is only the start of his very promising career as a genre director because Don't Breathe is an amazing sophomore effort.|Fresh
Alvarez's Evil Dead left many wondering what this visually talented director would do next. Inconsistent and offensive, Don't Breathe is not the follow-up many will have wanted.|Rotten
Don't Breathe is a masterful combination of suspense and violence that'll have you squirming in your seat and enjoying every minute of it.|Fresh
A muscular exercise in brutal, relentless peril.|Fresh
The first two-thirds are as solid a piece of thriller filmmaking as Hollywood has produced in a while.|Fresh
