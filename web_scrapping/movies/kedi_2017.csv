The film is cute, but nowhere near as profound as it thinks it is.|Fresh
A heart-warming, charming affair that cat lovers will fall head-over-heels for.|Fresh
The city teems with felines and the humans who are momentarily or forever transformed through sweet encounters. Sadly, encroaching urbanisation is a threat. Kedi is bittersweet balm for the weary.|Fresh

Kedi ('cat' in Turkish) is much more than a cute film showing these felines' day-to-day lives.|Fresh

A family friendly love poem to cats.|Fresh
As the camera follows cats through streets, or up onto rooftops; and as drone cameras hover above Istanbul, looking down at a city that has nurtured these creatures for thousands of years, a calm clarity sets in.|Fresh
Focusing on the seemingly unknowable perspectives of the cats, [Ceyda Torun] makes a case for the innate goodness of the human spirit.|Fresh
Between segments, the camera zooms over the city-even with its current 20 million human inhabitants, it's so gorgeous that I'm ready to pack my bags and get on a plane-and concentrates on one cat and its people.|Fresh
A must for fans of cats, cities and city cats.|Fresh

"The sultans of Istanbul have tails and say ""meow"". [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Istanbul and its wonderful warm, funny and loving relationship with free agent kitties.|Fresh
The delightful Kedi portrays a complex city founded on history and tradition, and surrounded by goodwill, magnificence, and fragility.|Fresh
In the end, it's all fairly light and fluffy fare, but made with care and shot with aplomb, it sums up expertly how these furry Istanbul inhabitants embody the chaos and are part of the soul of that city.|Fresh
Easy-going in mood and pacing, Kedi patiently follows a variety of felines through their routines, seemingly living very charmed lives in a city that prides itself on taking care of its cats.|Fresh
Gives us a synoptic vision of Istanbul as filtered through one of that ancient city's most unique traits, the enormous population of quasi-domestic cats roaming its streets.|Fresh
If all you know of cats is what you see on Facebook, you will be amazed by Kedi. If what you know about cats comes from your resident feline, you will be soothed and assured by Kedi.|Fresh
The enchanting Turkish documentary Kedi works triple time as a nature documentary, a travelogue, and a meditation on the human-animal bond.|Fresh
The philosophical depth unearthed in Kedi is astounding.|Fresh
Not only for cat people, then, but you need to be that way inclined if you are to be entranced by all of the many shots that just show cats being cats.|Fresh
Part wildlife documentary, part urban love letter. Kedi may only be a slender 79 minutes long, but it's a lyrical and surprising philosophical tribute to the therapeutic power of pets.|Fresh
While cat lovers will naturally be drawn to this documentary due to the subject matter alone, those with more ambiguous feelings towards our feline friends will also find oodles of things to enjoy in this well-crafted and lovable piece of film.|Fresh
It wears its affection on its sleeves - or, perhaps its collar - but pairs that obvious love with thoughtful insights.|Fresh
Torun has made a memorable film.|Fresh
This beautifully shot film will be catnip to fans of felines.|Fresh
The cats are captured with adoring attentiveness, their intelligent eyes narrowing to slits, their darting movements, a patch of sun-warmed fur, the way one kitten clambers a market stall to paw a pile of oranges.|Fresh

A purrfect antidote to blockbuster fatigue.|Fresh

A quietly profound chronicle of the region's history, a positive demonstration the power of kindness and even justice and, just maybe, a religious and spiritual experience. If you want it to be.|Fresh
The wonderful aspect of the film is how lovingly the director portrays the cats and their people. There isn't much of a story line or much of a dramatic arc, so viewers who are not cat lovers may want to skip it.|Fresh
You don't have to be a cat lover to appreciate the film.|Fresh
This captivating documentary casts a serenely powerful spell as it explores the extraordinary bond shared between the Turkish city's omnipresent four-pawed nomads and the humans who look after them.|Fresh

Defined by low to the ground camerawork that captures feline grace and a ruminative philosophical outlook, this Turkish documentary about the city of Istanbul's vast population of moggies overshadows any mere cat video online.|Fresh

There's a lot of light, heart, and compassion to be found in this lovely little documentary, and I hope it finds a warm, sunny place in the hearts of cat lovers everywhere.|Fresh

Director Ceyda Torun's first feature length documentary, Kedi is a delightful, engaging look at the city of Istanbul's population of street cats.|Fresh

A remarkable cinematic triumph that ought to have audiences purring for more.|Fresh
This is the kind of movie I love best - one that starts small, then reveals, slowly but surely, that all of life is contained somewhere inside of it.|Fresh
Imagine your favorite online cat video, multiply by hundreds... a ravishing beauty.|Fresh
Kedi is much less interested in just being a film about cats. Rather it is a film that uses cats as a platform to dive into the history of a city, its people, its culture, and questioning what our relationship with cats says about us.|Fresh
I loved it and I am more of a dog person, though I admit to having bonded with a few felines in my day. I daresay even elephant or giraffe people will love it, too.|Fresh
'Kedi' is steeped in charm and simple wisdom. I should state flat-out that I am not a cat person, but this film won me over all the same|Fresh
Cats, despite what any dog people reading may suggest, do make great friends, especially if you give them a whole city's worth of space.|Fresh
The synthesis of these themes with handsomely framed shots of narrow streets and darting and frolicking cats makes it clear that Kedi's subject is Istanbul, a modern city that stretches back into ancient times.|Fresh
"By the time ""Kedi"" puts these animals through their paces, only one essential question remains unanswered: Will the dogs of the Dardanelles demand equal exposure? This could be a trend."|Fresh
A cat's-eye view of the world that showcases both the warm-hearted people of this ancient Turkish city and the seamless integration of its felines into everyday life.|Fresh
The larger portrait of Istanbul as a city whose residents almost unconsciously look out for even the littlest among them is heartening in an era defined by increasing isolationism and scapegoating.|Fresh
In Istanbul, cats don't meow. They miyav. The cat sounds the same; it's humans who hear and see things differently, as our species seems to do when we're halfway around the world.|Fresh
I know not everyone is a cat person, but I think most will be Kedi people.|Fresh
A magical and immensely endearing documentary about the love affair between the people of Istanbul and the stray cats who wander the streets of the city.|Fresh
Though technically a sophisticated, artful documentary from Turkish filmmaker Ceyda Torun, Kedi will automatically find devout fans among anyone who delights at all things feline.|Fresh

Kedi, an enchanting documentary by Ceyda Torun, operates on three levels, and we're not speaking metaphorically here.|Fresh

I'm not going to mince words: Kedi will go down as the most unabashedly adorable film of the year.|Fresh

Why are other movies even made?|Fresh

Kedi will make you a believer.|Fresh
