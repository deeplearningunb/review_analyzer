Chaganty has created a digital web of mystery and intrigue, as we are thrust into a missing persons case that engrosses with every twist, turn, and keystroke.|Fresh
As its run-time rolls on, it grows so head-smackingly stupid and trite, you'll wonder why you wasted the time at all.|Rotten
Searching for a smart take on the internet? Look no further.|Fresh
While this style of storytelling has been used before in the horror genre (Unfriended comes to mind), it was interesting to see such an inventive manner of presenting a mystery/thriller story for the modern age.|Fresh
It's this in your face low-rent approach that really makes Searching special,Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian avoid turning internet technology into yet another horror movie bogeyman.|Fresh
A thrilling, unpredictable and riveting film|Fresh
No fancy shots are required to show the true fear and panic of a desperate father. Searching is so effective we cannot imagine it being made under a traditional method.|Fresh

CTRL+ALT+DEL this nonsense and find a film that knows how to treat you respectfully.|Rotten
"But even with Cho hitting on all cylinders, ""Searching"" ends up feeling like something that belongs more on your TV than a movie screen."|Fresh
Exciting and powerful. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""A kind of new version of Hardcore in the Breve New World of the internet and social networks""."|Fresh
One of the most original films I have seen in quite some time with just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very end.|Fresh
You may groan at the thought of another found footage desktop thriller, especially just a few weeks after an already-forgotten Unfriended sequel, but Aneesh Chaganty has managed to rejuvenate the genre.|Fresh
"Aneesh Chaganty's debut feature is one of the most exciting mystery films I've seen in a long time, and it's the first ""cyber-thriller told completely from a screen"" that's really convincing. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
This really is tantalizing stuff that elicits old-school thrills from new-school technology.|Fresh
At a certain point, Searching runs out of ways to organically use its medium and the tension erodes. The first two acts, however, are engrossing and remind the viewer that John Cho should be a star.|Fresh
For cases like Searching, innovation isn't enough.|Rotten
With clever and immersive storytelling, great performances, rich characterizations, surprising twists and ample amounts of food for thought, director Aneesh Chaganty has made a great feature debut with Searching.|Fresh
Mind-boggling, electric, and hugely-entertaining, this is one of the best surprises this year.|Fresh
"An out-of-left-field crowd-pleaser that just might be the best ""cyber-thriller"" ever made."|Fresh
The screen-centric format allows the viewer to play detective right along with Cho, the reams of emails and text messages making for a strangely interactive experience.|Fresh
This is a compelling thriller that takes the computer screen gimmick... and enhances it - with a film full of twists and turns and a surprising touch of humanism.|Fresh
Although I wish Chaganty trusted his audience a little bit more on the mystery side of the story, I must pay respect to a small thriller whose computer-screen gimmick actually elevated its subject matter.|Fresh
Both a technical and narrative triumph, the film elevates itself above its gimmicky stratagem with a genuinely suspenseful and emotionally engaging plot.|Fresh
Searching is Indian-American director Aneesh Chaganty's debut, and highlights a consummate knowledge of filmmaking that makes him a name to watch out for.|Fresh
Usually, the missing or abducted girl is a flat character who gets just a handful of lines, at best. Thankfully, Searching has other ideas.|Fresh
Despite the story being less inspired than you'd want or the tricks not being as clever as the filmmakers would anticipate - the concept is a bold one, told effectively and pieced together with precision.|Fresh
The tense thriller keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat with exceptional performances by John Cho and Debra Messing.|Fresh
Before slightly getting too silly at the end, it's an enthralling tale that brings out a surprising emotion.|Fresh
It's baffling, really, that anyone could suggest that Searching's narrative trajectory is any less insipid or dumb as what we get from the Unfriended films|Rotten
In short, it exceeds all expectations and reinforces director [Aneesh] Chaganty as a filmmaker to follow in the future. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Search no more - here's a terrific thriller.|Fresh
A cautionary note illustrating that we habitually fail to communicate with one another, and that's the underlying tragedy of the story.|Fresh
An entertaining thriller... that loses the opportunity to reflect on the use of technology. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This taut, twisty suspense thriller is told mostly through computer screens running on old Windows XP software. This is very cleverly done, but the gimmick turns what could have been a much more dynamic movie into a somewhat static one.|Fresh
Proof that gimmickry can work when employed with intelligence.|Fresh
Half social commentary regarding the use of technology in daily life, and half mystery thriller with a high quota of emotion. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Effervescent entertainment with a wild rhythm in which themes as transcendent as adolescent loneliness or sexual abuse are overturned. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
John Cho delivers a nuanced and masterful performance...Searching largely remains an effective piece of cinema, perhaps even the start of something new.|Fresh
Searching has added a very special ingredient - good acting. John Cho is utterly convincing in the role of harrowed dad and widower.|Fresh
John Cho provides a level of tenacity in a main character that I haven't felt since Denzel in John Q. The family dynamic is intoxicating, from the heartbreaking intro to the gripping finish.|Fresh
Searching is a shining and highly entertaining thriller starring John Cho. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Searching follows Eighth Grade as another thought-provoking film about the intersection between teens' lives and their presence-and reliance-on social media.|Fresh
John Cho's sympathetic and fully committed performance as the worried father grounds the movie, giving it a beating heart instead of just a racing pulse.|Fresh
In Searching, the computer is another member of the family that listens and sees the stories of the day. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A good, crisp, gnarly thriller, with exactly the right amount of human interest for it to pretend to be more than just a grubby shocker.|Fresh
The form is absolutely as important as the content [and] the good news is that the form holds well ... If the gimmick doesn't hold you, I'm not sure the script will, but in tandem, they add up to something solid and clever without re-setting the bar.|Fresh
Searching's mystery is constructed like the interior of a clock. Everything adds up, with no noticeable plot holes. It's impressively designed.|Fresh
It's done with few words but it's unexpectedly touching, fulfilling the film's key promise - that it's going to make you care about these people, despite the secondhand nature of its delivery system.|Fresh
Much of this is cleverly, even wittily handled, and Cho is very believable as he grows more and more panicked and angry.|Fresh
A stinging thriller, with a residue of paranoia about one's own footsteps caught in digital amber.|Fresh
Searching, beneath the conceit of the staging, is a nicely assembled and very acceptably twisty mystery yarn.|Fresh
It was just very interesting how they shot it.|Fresh
Perhaps Searching's biggest achievement is the way it so eloquently illustrates the gulf that can exist between a loving-if-flawed father and his struggling adolescent daughter.|Fresh
It helps when you have a lead like John Cho, who after 20 years in the industry is finally bagging the kind of starring roles he deserves.|Fresh
While Searching's innovative and highly efficient visual structure does impress, it is the screenplay's efficiency in playing upon our deepest fears of today's connected world that truly impacts: drawing you in, grinding you down and getting you worried.|Fresh
I also appreciated how it shows David benignly browsing the web and opening multiple tabs of news stories at once, without reading any. I mean, I was watching him, but in that moment, it was I who felt truly seen.|Fresh
When it's orchestrating the central mystery, it's like a well-oiled thrill machine.|Fresh
An audacious tale that is well worth searching out.|Fresh
"Things get a little too ""twisty"" during the climax but Searching is a cool concept with strong execution."|Fresh
David's tech-based search for his daughter keeps us engaged until the bitter or not-so-bitter end, Cho's performance exposing layers the actor has only begun to access.|Fresh
This is not just a high concept movie, it is a drama well served by a script that is designed to fit the vehicle and vice versa.|Fresh
If it wasn't so good, you could call it gimmicky, but this novel concept using the computer screen and assorted technologies is so well executed that the result is a gripping mystery thriller that never lets up.|Fresh
An extremely tasty thriller that delivers exactly the right amount of suspense and twisty surprises.|Fresh
I was floored by the craft on display.|Fresh
Searching handles skillfully the various social platforms proposed by a conceptual mise-en-scene. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's not preachy at all... but it is making this statement about social media... the movie captures a lot of ugly moments that we become familiar with.|Fresh
Not sure what's more surprising, that the movie-on-a-laptop-screen format actually works, or that John Cho delivers one of his finest performances in one.|Fresh
First-time filmmaker Aneesh Chaganty does an absolutely fantastic job of instantly drawing the viewer into the proceedings...|Fresh
I had no inkling that a movie that was essentially filmed with Skype could keep me on the edge of my seat.|Fresh
"There's a thin line between unique and gimmick, but Chaganty handles his execution in a way that makes ""Searching"" immensely engaging."|Fresh
A welcome oasis in the movie desert of early fall, Searching is Exhibit A.|Fresh
Searching never opts for the traditional scene set-up, and, impressively, never feels too gimmicky.|Fresh
The film's ingenuity would have tickled Hitchcock. It's a smart, confident debut.|Fresh
The tech savvy displayed by a middle-aged man will intimidate many but it's the dramatic but far-fetched late twist that does the damage.|Fresh
Some of it is lame - would you really leave your webcam on during such a crisis? - but it keeps you guessing as it serves up a very current and sobering parental nightmare.|Fresh
The film doesn't understand what mode it wants to operate in; serious thriller with emotional stakes or contrived, cynical satire.|Rotten
Ingenious, innovative, computer-centric, psychological thriller...you won't be able to log off!|Fresh
Chaganty's style is fresh and contemporary, relevant and slick.|Fresh
What makes Searching more than a gimmick is how well it captures the limited but instantly recognizable emotional language of computer use.|Fresh
A pretty slick and efficient thriller. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Searching is more than just an empty stylistic exercise. Beneath the cool techno thrills, there is a beating heart. It's one of the best and most innovative thrillers of the year.|Fresh
Searching is a suspenseful drama, buoyed by its innovative filmmaking style and collection of strong performances by its leads.|Fresh
...a brilliantly devised thriller that is told in such a captivating way that it is almost impossible not to enjoy.|Fresh
As the human face of the film if often only rendered on smaller screens looking pensively into his phone, Cho has to carry much of the narrative on his back, even as the screen is filled with competing windows filled with vast accumulations of information|Fresh
Searching is very much a conventional whodunit that has its share of satisfyingly predictable twists and turns and emotionally resonant moments.|Fresh
No matter how many issues I had with the conclusion, however, the whole is effectively drawn.|Fresh
... it's still fun to watch Cho's impression of a man gradually coming unglued over the course of 100 minutes.|Fresh
As a drama about a father and a daughter relationship, Searching is nuanced and affecting.|Fresh
As David, John Cho handles it all entirely convincingly, alternating between concerned and infuriated, bobbing and weaving with the demands of detective Vick, a fine Debra Messing.|Fresh
John Cho shines in this brilliantly crafted thriller, that makes its concept work. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cho is rarely off screen and he gives this digital masterpiece heart and flashes of humour.|Fresh
Stumbles through explanatory zigzags and switchbacks, and definitely overexerts itself for a sense of justice rarely, if ever, found online. At least it's more interested in an introspective interrogation of identity rather than fingering suspects.|Fresh
Some nice moves but as shallow as YouTube celebrity.|Rotten
Chaganty [has] cleverly utilized relatable online investigative tools (who among us has not been frustrated by come-ons offering to find a friend if one will only subscribe for $49.95?), but they've also elevated their story above gimmickry...|Fresh
Suspenseful for about an hour before Chaganty gives up on the concept of everyday fears, electing instead to close a previously promising mystery with a prolonged Lifetime Movie-style decline.|Fresh
Classic crime story about a missing child that smartly goes modern using the latest tech advances on the Internet to search for a missing teen girl.|Fresh
Despite a huge plot hole and some handy explanation from news reporters, this is a really sharp film.|Fresh
For most of its running time, Searching refreshes our screens. Smiley face.|Fresh
It's possible this movie might work better streamed on your own laptop, as the windows-within-windows effect gets multiplied.|Rotten
Done any other way and this is a very average story you'd usually find on one of those one-hour forensic detective shows. Done this way and it's brilliant.|Fresh
Riveting right up to the end, which is a cheat.|Fresh
In the end, the technique feels like a red herring designed to distract attention from how corny the story really is.|Rotten
Searching is presented in such a fascinating way that its best moments suggest a fresh form of storytelling, and its worst moments become tolerable.|Fresh
The distancing effect of technology turns the mawkish into something more meaningful and provides an impassive foil for David's meltdown.|Fresh
[W]hile there's adequate material here to hold one's interest, we long, throughout, for the promise of the brilliant opening.|Fresh
The film's skeleton isn't a commercial gimmick; the style is in fact an integral part of infusing the story with an extra tonal dimension to make us feel a certain way.|Fresh
A nicely entertaining and relatively intelligent bit of cinematic paranoia, but it almost crashes spectacularly upon landing.|Fresh
I really liked this movie and I think that one of the reasons I liked it is because they took the format and applied to a mystery.|Fresh
The metaphor for hiding, the metaphor for lying to ourselves, the metaphor for covering who we really are that exists in our online personas is so well played out in this movie...|Fresh
That there is an intimately personal angle here ... is a testament to Chaganty's storytelling abilities.|Fresh
This movie works best as a showcase for Cho.|Fresh
Searching is a fresh, relevant take on the genre that pulls off telling a story in a new manner yet never stoops to gimmickry or tricks to enthrall the audience.|Fresh
Chaganty's work is phenomenal, creating tension, and claustrophobia with the rhythm of a filmmaker who has directed dozens of films of this genre. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Searching is a true game-changer in every sense of the word. Do not miss this at any cost.|Fresh
What holds Searching together is its star. Always an enjoyable comedian, Cho has grown into a reliably good actor and aged nicely, providing a sad-eyed soulfulness.|Fresh
The first 10 minutes of Searching rival the prelude of Pixar's Up in using simple, elegant visual storytelling to deliver an emotional wallop.|Fresh
The script is littered with twists and McGuffins. Shallow, humourless and overloaded with computer-y jargon, Searching barely merits a click.|Rotten
Wasting a decent performance from John Cho as the desperate father of a missing teen, this film never commits to a cogent reason why it had to be told in such a way.|Rotten
"Making maximum use of audience familiarity with the dangers of social media, ""Searching"" succeeds in punching up a run-of-the-mill Lifetime movie-of-the-week with clever visual gimmickry."|Fresh
Searching may strike older viewers as a novel experimental film, but more importantly it's a genuine white-knuckling exploration of our relationship with disruptive technology and how that impacts one average American family's daily life.|Fresh
Searching ambitiously updates the worst nightmare scenario for parents in intriguing ways.|Fresh
Skeptical audiences might think a film like this would be limited by the method it chooses to tell its story, but with a smart script and a heartfelt father-daughter relationship at its core, Searching is an absorbing and unique achievement.|Fresh
A missing-person thriller that holds your attention for awhile simply because of the unusual way it's told, but by the end it's literally gone over a cliff into narrative absurdity.|Rotten
Twisty thrills also result in a climactic pileup, a resolution that strains credibility...with a dynamic leading performance by Cho, Chaganty manages an engaging popcorn suspense picture that also speaks to technology enabling and frustrating...|Fresh
Searching is also a powerful conversation starter. It's worth watching just for the questions it raises about who we are in a digital world, and how real our virtual connections really are.|Fresh
John Cho leads and carries this film like his own personal project, his performance as a distraught father, paired with a smart plot has turned this kind of filmmaking on its head.|Fresh
The smart visual trickery lifts what might otherwise have been a fairly conventional thriller, but it also lets Chaganty say some interesting things about our online lives.|Fresh
It's neither the first nor the best movie about living (and dying) online, but San Jose-raised filmmaker Aneesh Chaganty's thriller Searching is an absorbing picture.|Fresh
Mostly, Searching holds the moderate, passive appeal of watching a competent player ace a round of Minesweeper, each click bringing us closer to the desired resolution.|Fresh
Twist upon twist is daringly and entertainingly contrived by exciting debut director Aneesh Chaganty,.|Fresh
With smarts, warmth, and humanity, this mystery that unfurls entirely on computer screens becomes an ode to the new digital lives we are all leading, from how we use our devices to what they say about us.|Fresh
David is achingly human, eager and desperate, then driven to explosiveness, before bottoming out in his guilt. It is through David that we understand just how little we know the people we are supposedly close to.|Fresh
"""Searching"" is like a refreshed web page, a new take on something woefully familiar."|Fresh
[A] clever but silicon-chip-thin movie...|Fresh
...speaks uncomfortable but necessary truths about the Internet age in a way that forces the audience to pay attention.|Fresh
Searching is about the literal and metaphorical portals we open when we choose to live online, the negotiations between our public histories and hidden secrets we enter into.|Fresh
...impressively uses the technology we're familiar with to craft a mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat.|Fresh
A smart, riveting and powerful thriller that suggests the screen life format can add a lot to traditional cinematic storytelling.|Fresh
We become lost within the frame. We suspend our disbelief not to see a film on a screen, but a film framed to a screen.|Fresh
In its most inventive moments, it almost feels like a new way of storytelling.|Fresh
First-time filmmaker Aneesh Chaganty (a former Google employee, appropriately) is a resourceful man, and a very clever one; he nearly aces his high-wire conceit to the end.|Fresh
An extremely well plotted thriller with enough satisfying twists and turns to keep you entirely engaged.|Fresh
A refreshing perspective to its genre with a gratifying performance by John Cho.|Fresh
Whether you want to argue that its against-the-grain casting and its specific format are beside the point or entirely the point, it's a damn great thriller and one of the best studio releases of the year.|Fresh
The film does take a few too many turns on its journey. The end feels rushed, outlandish and possibly even reshot|Fresh
You're actually able to follow and get invested in this family just by following their digital activity -- feels both improbable and inevitable.|Fresh
Chaganty and the team behind Searching have made something quite spectacular. A near-perfectly paced, thrilling drama, and a captivating performance from John Cho.|Fresh
The mystery's twists and turns are compelling enough in their own right, but the style with which they're presented elevates the material to incisive commentary.|Fresh
A clever update on a housebound Hitchcock thriller like Rear Window, one that can make a series of Google searches play out like a high-wire action scene.|Fresh
Searching provides an experience that colors outside the constraints of digital boxes, going far beyond a simple visual gimmick.|Fresh
If you're looking for a fresh take on the thriller genre, I highly suggest you check this one out.|Fresh
There's a clear understanding of and respect for the essentials of good storytelling: fully developed characters, a strong narrative and a sense of purpose.|Fresh
Even if the plot stretches itself thin after a while, Cho's compelling performance holds the movie together, anchoring it in real emotions of desperation and grief.|Fresh
Perhaps inspired by the success of 2014's Unfriended, this mystery ventures in fresh, new directions while being superbly constructed, emotionally satisfying, and culturally relevant.|Fresh
Searching is a suspenseful and terrifying tale about the dangers of the digital era. It will send shivers down the spine of every parent ignorant of their children's online activities.|Fresh
The gimmick of setting the action in the center of our Google world genuinely works for all 100-plus minutes, and even after adjusting to its unusual hook makes you forget the gimmick entirely after a while.|Fresh
Thematically relevant and persistently moving the form forward, Searching is an emotional roller coaster, taking a familiar premise and invigorating it along with biting commentary on viral video culture.|Fresh
The structural manipulation enhances the suspense without inhibiting the solid acting, resulting in a compelling mystery but also a provocative cautionary tale about online connectivity, particularly among parents and children.|Fresh
It aims for and earns genuine emotion rather than cheap thrills.|Fresh
"An urgent and unnerving masterclass in creating tension through minimalism, dripping with the peril of what has already taken place and what may occur next. ""Searching"" is sure to remain one of 2018's best and smartest thrillers."|Fresh
With the exception of visually artificial broadcast news videos in the third act, the execution in Searching is an anomaly in its inventiveness to find solutions that can keep us engaged in spite of the claustrophobic set-up.|Fresh
There's no question now...[John Cho] is a great actor. Only a great actor could do what he is required to do in this movie and pull it off the way he does.|Fresh
Its bold embrace of technology is near-revolutionary.|Fresh
This may be the first feature written and directed by Aneesh Chaganty, a 27-year-old Bay Area native and former Google employee, but the intricacy of his visual design is matched by a talent for old-fashioned suspense filmmaking.|Fresh
Along with producing a taut thriller, Chaganty balances the story with very human moments.|Fresh
Does Searching make a case for more movies to be made using the screen-life technique? Not necessarily. But for 102 minutes it keeps you hooked.|Fresh
Director Aneesh Chaganty builds a high-voltage thriller told through smartphones, laptop screens, browser windows and surveillance footage. The film is a technical marvel with a beating heart, which makes all the difference.|Fresh
"Following fast on the heels of the massive success of ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" this is proof positive that a long-overdue Asian invasion is finally hitting American movie theatres, and will hopefully never stop."|Fresh
"The combination of clever concept reflecting the prevalence of screens in everyday life, and the pleasure of watching a typically underused Mr. Cho take on a meaty lead role make ""Searching"" a satisfying psychological thriller."|Fresh
Co-writers Chaganty and Sev Ohanian carefully construct a twisty whodunit that flirts with the lurid but ultimately remains grounded in suburban reality.|Fresh
The movie might work better if the psychological puzzle tucked inside it were more engaging or surprising. But as the pieces fall into place, in a clunky resolution, the story turns as flat as the screens that contain it.|Rotten
This is not only a great found footage movie, but it's also a damn great mystery.|Fresh
Cho is fully engaging as a typical father fighting his way through the online forest of his daughter's life, which proves to be more dense and tangled than he ever suspected.|Fresh
Searching shows how disconnected we really are as a species from one another, by telling this story through the devices and websites that are supposed to bring us together.|Fresh
Searching is absorbing enough as a narrative on its own terms, even as we're watching it through a highly unusual lens that often reduces our daily lives and connections to fragmentary bursts of information.|Fresh
The story unfolds in overlapping windows so recognisable that even one false moment would be glaring, and it's remarkable that Chaganty keeps everything almost eerily authentic.|Fresh
Strip away the tech trappings and you'll find the same propulsive joys that powered '90s thrillers like 'Presumed Innocent' and 'The Fugitive'.|Fresh
Examines the very best capabilities of technology (such as preserving familial memories) and some of the worst things that can happen online if people aren't careful. Yes, one of 2018's best plays out on nothing but computer screens|Fresh
It's a taut, groundbreaking thriller with a hugely emotional heartbeat.|Fresh
As a thriller, Searching is both ruthlessly absorbing in the moment and relatively disposable as soon as it ends, sliding itself gracefully into the desktop recycling bin.|Fresh
An electrifying, emotional, and wildly entertaining thriller.|Fresh
Despite its unconventional set-up, where every scene is contained within a digital screen, Searching has plenty of momentum and asks troubling but timely questions about the price we pay for 24/7 online access.|Fresh
"To anyone who thinks they've ""seen it all"" when it comes to tech-based storytelling, I assure you that Searching offers up something very different and wholly memorable."|Fresh
Without a doubt, Searching is the most effective use yet of the screen life technique, although I'd like to see it may be used outside of the thriller genre.|Fresh
Searching is so smart about how we interact with computers that it's surprising how lame it is about moviemaking basics like characters and plot.|Rotten
As nimble as Aneesh Chaganty is in presenting his main character's multi-faceted interaction with technology in the first hour, the film suddenly morphs into a generic and manipulative missing-person thriller.|Rotten
Imagine if Up and Unfriended had a baby. But a stupid, ugly baby starring John Cho.|Rotten
Among all of the films exclusively composed of images from the screens of computers and other such electronic devices, Searching stands out as the most earnest and the least silly - which doesn't mean it isn't also a lot of fun.|Fresh
How some of the scenes were pulled off is still a mystery to this critic, and all the better for it, as the film has plenty of flair and tension to suck just about anybody into its story.|Fresh
Searching is an enjoyable and inventive thriller that delivers gut-wrenching suspense and unexpected levels of emotion, while also serving as a timely reminder to check the security of your password protection.|Fresh
"An original blast of a film. ""Searching"" heartily implies we instinctively know our dearest family members better than we give ourselves credit for, even when the evidence insists otherwise."|Fresh
Searching is an utterly riveting watch.|Fresh
Keeping your eyes glued to a computer has rarely been more riveting.|Fresh
Aneesh Chaganty's whipsmart thriller starts on a computer screen and stays there.|Fresh
John Cho gives emotional heft to this inventive exploration of a new type of film grammar.|Fresh
The online world becomes a narrative device to frame a conventional mystery that slips into abject ludicrousness as the story unravels.|Rotten
The film - co-written by Sev Ohanian - is not just clever in the way that it uses familiar programs and the Windows and Apple Mac environments but also in the way it triggers familiar emotions.|Fresh
Searching is an intense roller coaster of a thriller that takes place on entirely on computer and smartphone screens.|Fresh
As the style begins to wear out its welcome, the promise of a resolution and nifty twist keep things nimble.|Fresh
It's a testament to how well-made the film is that the mystery always remains far more engrossing than the showy gimmick.|Fresh
Displays the type of roller coaster experience that can be achieved from crafty writing and a canvas as simple as a blank screen.|Fresh
Search doesn't require any further narrative tricks to prove Chagnaty's ability to use seemingly huge constraints to weave a unique film, one that maintains a near-perfect connect with its audience.|Fresh
"None of this would matter if we didn't care about the characters, and in ""Search,"" [Aneesh] Chaganty has found a new idiom for communicating not only the things we share, but also those we keep hidden from the ones we love."|Fresh
The movie's arresting visual conceit has enough flexibility to sustain interest, even if the story's twists and turns sometimes feel excessively fiendish.|Fresh
In all respects, what Chaganty and his team have pulled off here is something both novel and accomplished.|Fresh
Director Aneesh Chaganty uses these formats exactly as they are used in real life. None are stretched to make the gimmick work.|Fresh
Searching is an innovative and intense roller coaster ride. It has not only redefined the mystery genre but storytelling as a whole.|Fresh
Search is shockingly effective, not just in creating a sense of constant, palpable tension, but also in the way it pulls off authentic, effective emotional beats.|Fresh
