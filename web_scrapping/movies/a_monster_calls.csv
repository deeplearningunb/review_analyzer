A Monster Calls finds director J.A. Bayona ladling out sentiment in thick, gloopy globs, and what might have been an engaging story.|Rotten

"A brilliant coming of age drama that tackles an adolescent dealing with loss in a way not this well devised since ""Bridge to Terabithia."""|Fresh

The film is essentially about Conor's internal struggle - man vs. himself maybe, although he's not yet a man - where hope battles despair.|Fresh

The power of parable and grim realities of grieving take centre stage in A Monster Calls, a potent mash of gritty coming of age drama and Gothic fantasy that once again displays the strong visual and storytelling talents of director J.A. Bayona.|Fresh

It grows more tiresome as it goes on, not just because of the movie's telegraphed structure and all-too-prominent message but also because the stories themselves are not that special.|Rotten

"Despite the outstanding performances and visuals, ""A Monster Calls"" is seriously too dark to be entertaining. It's much too traumatizing for children, and I don't know why adults would choose to see it, either."|Rotten
The strength of this beautiful and yes painful film is how it uses grim fantasy to teach that sometimes it's okay to let the monster in all of us out.|Fresh

Ultimately, it hits us that we are viewing grief from two directions - youthful incomprehension and sad experience.|Fresh
The film has been praised as an excellent coming-of-age tale, but even applying that term fails to do justice to its deliverance. This is a coming-of-age-of-reason story.|Fresh
Bayona delivers the monster's stories in gorgeously animated sequences that capture our imaginations. It is also refreshing to hear tales told to a child that offer complex moral lessons.|Fresh
A Monster Calls is a fairytale about the bogusness of fairytales -- about the reality of unhappy endings and the darkness and light that lives within us all. Guess your kid has to learn about existentialism eventually, right?|Fresh

Filmmaker J.A. Bayona keeps things visually interesting at all times in A Monster Calls. On a storytelling level, he doesn't pull his punches.|Fresh

Visually imaginative but lacking in narrative magic...a beautifully wrought but curiously sterile affair that probably won't appeal overmuch to either children or their parents.|Rotten

Bayona imbues A Monster Calls with a magical tone even when the monster isn't present.|Fresh
If you've got a thing about being seen crying in public, you might want to take a pass on catching A Monster Calls in a theater. But that would be a big mistake.|Fresh
Harrowing yet exhilaratingly imaginative, A Monster Calls is a brilliant fable that sheds a warm, hopeful light on one of life's darkest chapters.|Fresh

A Monster Calls isn't so much for kids as it is for grownups. It's a reminder of the time when we, too, thought only of ourselves-and found it too much to bear.|Fresh
Utterly heartbreaking but ultimately uplifting.|Fresh
This psychological drama which takes place inside the mind of a young boy caught between childhood and adulthood packs a powerful emotional punch. It is well acted and directed. The animation and computer graphics are also very impressive.|Fresh
'A Monster Calls' is not an easy movie for children to watch because Boyana refuses to ease the pain and turmoil that is evident in Conor.|Fresh
Bayona packs his tale with spellbinding visuals and honest emotion, and if the ending doesn't reduce you to tears, you may be the real monster.|Fresh

A visually-enchanting, if fateful, fairy tale.|Fresh
The special effects are impressive enough but what really matters are the performances.|Fresh
It's a curious film, beautifully rendered and at times deeply moving, yet somehow, I reckon, managing to be too scary and confusing for most children, yet too childlike and simplistic for many adults.|Fresh
Amid all the creaking, thunder-cracking, storm-lashed mayhem, Ness's own hand at the tiller of the screenplay means the story's emotional core remains intact.|Fresh
A heart-searing drama that slides effortlessly from real life to animated tales to a monster hewn from a yew tree (and some top-notch motion-capture CGI).|Fresh
Despite its rough subject matter, A Monster Calls is more than just the cinematic version of a cathartic scream. Rather, it's a film that holds your hand while never sugarcoating the difficult ideas at its core.|Fresh
"A Vivid, Effective ""Monster."""|Fresh
Bayona has a gifted cast, and he's ready to get lost in this corner of the world, building a fantasy that's reinforced with decidedly credible emotion.|Fresh
This is an affecting movie with a lump-in-the-throat ending, but I have to confess to finding its fantasy quotient a bit twee ...|Fresh
It may not be the heartwarming tale that you might expect, but it's the film's abrupt and sometimes confrontational nature towards a difficult subject matter that makes A Monster Calls such a standout effort.|Fresh
This has its visually wondrous moments, and the lead (Lewis MacDougall) is a true find, but there's too much bark, too little bite.|Rotten
Its extraordinary power lies in the interweaving of the fantastical and the everyday.|Fresh
Neeson and Felicity Jones (as mum) anchor, in emotional reality, the fable's life lessons about growing up.|Fresh

A Monster Calls is an unexpectedly powerful and unsentimental exploration of surviving grief and the less-than-noble feelings it can engender.|Fresh

Hopefully, audiences looking for something unique and special will welcome this gorgeous drama into their heart.|Fresh

A Monster Calls is by no means an easygoing viewing experience, but this is not to be missed.|Fresh

strives to be serious-minded but the fussiness is as wooden as the hulking creature it uses to laboriously lay out its points|Rotten

...has some arresting creative flourishes, as well as enough genuine emotion to forgive the more maudlin touches.|Fresh
A Monster Calls joins a rich trove of movies in which children process real-life ordeals by escaping into elaborate fantasies, which doesn't make director J.A. Bayona's film any less beautiful or haunting.|Fresh
As solid as this particular Monster Tree is, some broken branches cry out for pruning.|Fresh

Even the most hardened of hearts will be transformed into a blubbering, quaking mess by the time the lights come up.|Fresh
Despite its shortcomings, there are things about this film that are hard to shake; the movie's ultimate wisdom and overarching compassion make it very likely that you won't want to shake them, after all.|Fresh

Young Lewis MacDougall is very good as Conor as is Felicity Jones as his mother, while Sigourney Weaver invests the difficult part of the grandmother with a tightly wound intensity.|Fresh

The film is tough-minded, often grim and intense, its lessons about death and grief hard in ways you aren't conditioned to expect from pricey CGI entertainments.|Fresh
"The film belongs alongside ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in the realm of darkly creative kid-centric films that are, at their core, not really kids' fare at all."|Fresh

The technical wizardry exhibited throughout A Monster Calls is complimented by Bayona's assured direction and a tender script by Patrick Ness.|Fresh
It bravely tackles a difficult subject with grace and sensitivity, and its message is deeply moving and affecting.|Fresh
The visuals are lush, but Conor's world is small, English and grim. The light at the end of a long, dark tunnel - if it comes at all - will be hard won.|Fresh
J A Bayona has conjured a bittersweet and often painfully moving account of bereavement and growing up.|Fresh
Despite its fantastical elements and occasionally obvious plot points, it is a film about emotional truths and an admirable attempt to inject some real heart and soul into a YA adaptation. And not even a love triangle in sight.|Fresh

Mixing animation and heartfelt storytelling, the film features an impressive break-out performance from Edinburgh actor Lewis MacDougall in the central role.|Fresh
Darkly inspired, A Monster Calls is highly affecting - but surely too much so as a survival aid for the children who might need it? Yet it's not quite for adult adults either.|Fresh
A glorious, colourful mesh of styles that reflects Connor's inner conflict and turmoil; a melody for his mother's malady.|Fresh
A tear jerker for very sensitive people but if you're not one of them, you will not be moved because of the excessive narrative precision. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
A Monster Calls manages to combine fantasy and realism to create a story that deals with grief in a mature, respectable way that is sure to pull at your heartstrings.|Fresh
Even though it's roaring its message in your face, it's a message that is undeniably important, incredibly moving and honestly delivered.|Fresh
It tries hard to simultaneously be exciting, emotional and magical. And while it doesn't always manage to nail that tricky trifecta, it provides a number of touching moments and a behemoth to remember.|Fresh
J.A. Bayona's A Monster Calls is a masterpiece. Full stop.|Fresh
Considering how easily the material could turn maudlin, it's especially notable that Bayona avoids overstatement.|Fresh
Bayona knows how to turn the screw of sentiment, not so much jerking tears as gradually filling a well of sadness until it can't help but spill out.|Fresh
A story of a bullied child, a mother with cancer and a bad tempered grandmother. Only the director can save us from this scenario. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With A Monster Calls, however, J.A. Bayona displays the knowledge, assurance, and wit of a filmmaker truly coming into his own. Entertaining, tonally impeccable, and heartbreaking, this is a monster movie with a very human heart.|Fresh

This movie probably actually counts as therapy. The tears feel earned though, rather than cheaply stolen.|Fresh
A Monster Calls is a coming-of-age tearjerker wrapped inside a web of fantasy and magic.|Fresh
A handsomely mounted (if slightly airless) story of monsters and nightmares, and the real-life terrors that inspire them.|Fresh
For those kids who lock into its frequency, A Monster Calls could be a film that changes their lives. For the rest of us, it's a very admirable failure.|Rotten
It's a beautiful little storm cloud of a movie, that communicates the nuances of grief movingly, but also perfectly illustrates why we sometimes avoid grieving people.|Fresh
By the end, A Monster Calls certainly provokes some tears, but they're coaxed out by a manipulative hand.|Rotten
All in all, A Monster Calls is a highly satisfying film.|Fresh
A movie filled with good intentions but the excessive drama makes the interesting premise feel weak. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
J.A. Bayona has created an unforgettable, emotional experience with A Monster Calls, one that lets us grapple with our most basic human fears and worries, while lighting a beacon of hope that can shine through that darkness.|Fresh
Bayona ... deluges his story - albeit well acted and technically-flawless - with emotionally coded representational imagery and hectors the viewer with stylistic shifts, mood swings, and frantic pacing.|Fresh
If you can't connect to the story -- as I couldn't -- A Monster Calls just feels awfully manipulative and hollow.|Rotten
A splendidly rendered, yet oddly ill-conceived terminal-illness melodrama that feels much too dark and serious for audiences Conor's age, and an even more curious fit for grown-ups.|Rotten
Giving this film to a person who has yet to experience tragedy for themselves is arming them against future strife. I don't just recommend J.A. Bayona's movie, I deem it necessary.|Fresh
It's all of course nakedly manipulative, much like Bayona's last film, The Impossible. Luckily, his actors sell the hell out of the premise.|Fresh
A film that is likely to have you in tears the entire way through.|Fresh
There's a truly monstrous film lurking in here somewhere, but Bayona seems hell-bent on keeping it at bay.|Fresh
Deeply emotive and heart-achingly sad, A Monster Calls is a tremendous triumph.|Fresh
There's enough nuance to hold intrigue and enough compassion to be a resounding success.|Fresh
A Monster Calls gets off to a rocky start, but once Neeson's talking tree starts spouting tales of wisdom, everything tightens as the tears start flowing.|Fresh
It's a little on the nose, but the film is realized with such sincerity, such vivid imagery, and such raw emotion that it's hard to fault. Just remember to bring Kleenex. Lots of it.|Fresh
