A coruscating parable of responsibility - one that shines an unflinching, interrogative light on the damage caused by a culture of carelessness and narcissism.|Fresh
It's a haunting experience that will linger with the audience long after the closing credits.|Fresh
Methodical, unsettling and icily beautiful, Loveless paints a devastating portrait of a soulless modern world, but Zvyagintsev over-relies on easy targets and teasing portent.|Fresh
Andréi Zvyagintsev's films investigate the emotional depth of his characters within a certain socio-family context that, in turn, can be presented as a metaphor for broader human behavior. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Puts an icy hand on your arm and carries you slowly through a haunting study of societally-damaging moral detachment and the innate responsibility of parenthood.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev's films depict absence as much as presence.|Fresh
Rage, hatred, unhappiness and life in cramped conditions - all are part of the unnatural mix of contemporary Russian society in Zvyagintsev's bleak and chilling vision.|Fresh
Being the blunt object that it is, Loveless injects scathing critiques of Putin-era bureaucracy and rampant fundamentalism in both the workplace and homestead... There are few bitterer pills one can imagine swallowing.|Fresh
The jolie-laide sequences of earnest young people in high-visibility jackets moving in attentive silence through Moscow's ugly and abandoned places are a masterclass in the slow burn, almost invisible building of unbearable, unforgivable tension.|Fresh

Consummate formalist, brilliant esthete, rigorous filmmaker able to build captivating planes and breathtaking climates, Zvyagintsev offers in Loveless. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Eventually, as in L'Avventura (1960), the quest will come to an end, and a prickly normality will resume. For while Alexey may be the film's absent focus, this is also a slow-motion portrait of two people lost in their lives and longing for change...|Fresh
Given the current political climate, the story has undeniable resonance on this hemisphere too. Indeed, this is one of the rare foreign-language films wherein an American remake would be wholly justified.|Fresh
An emotionally stark indictment of middle class malaise and the broken promises of an empire, Loveless is one of the best films you'll see this year.|Fresh
Beautifully shot and acted, the story and themes get deep under the skin|Fresh
A masterpiece, a brutal, uncompromising, stunningly well crafted and extraordinarily observant depiction of modern life, relationships, parenting, and society ... At every turn it is revealing and stunningly precise about the human condition.|Fresh
Thin on character and narrative.|Rotten
A fairly devastating critique of contemporary Russian life, now that such a thing is possible.|Fresh
Something vital, his films intimates, has been lost in Russia, and perhaps not only in Russia - some warmth of the soul, a sense of civic accountability. As with the child, no one even noticed it slipping away.|Fresh
It's a kind of thriller, but without easy resolution. Zvyagintsev does not deal in reassurance: there is none to be had in this cold, hard place.|Fresh
Sometimes [Andrey Zvyagintsev] can fall into the didactic, his symbolism and criticisms too obvious, but at his best (thankfully most of the film) the director applies an admirable subtly. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Is this what Russia is really like today? Obviously there's more to it than this, but this cold yet extremely gifted director's dissection of his society is never less than riveting.|Fresh
It's the kind of premise that - in the hands of a more sentimental director - might deliver a glimmer of reconciliation between the two, but Zvyagintsev is not a filmmaker interested in letting his characters off the hook.|Fresh
A haunting, heavy-hearted affair...|Fresh
An unapologetic lamentation, not just over the state of its leading characters' lives but also -- like Leviathan -- over the state of life today in Vladimir Putin's deeply apathetic Russia.|Fresh
The premise seems to be taken from a Ruth Rendell novel. The search for the kid will not unite the marriage but to spread the lack of love between man and woman to all those around them. (Complete review in Spanish in newspaper Reforma).|Fresh
Andrey Zvyagintsev, who wrote the script along with Oleg Negin, makes this a merciless film, implacable, severe and uncomfortable... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A depressing but engrossing Russian blend of a domestic drama and police procedural crime drama|Fresh
...Zvyagintsev shows us characters wasting their lives and becoming morally adrift...|Fresh
Zvyagintsev is a powerful teller of the truth, and his latest is a modern-day masterpiece.|Fresh
All three leads give subtly wrenching performances that wouldn't have been out of place in Ingmar Bergman's oeuvre.|Fresh
'Loveless' is not so much about finding the boy, but about how easily a person can be discarded or abandoned by parents who - because of their resentments and recriminations - already have moved onto new lives.|Fresh
Just about every aspect of Loveless is executed perfectly.|Fresh
It's a dreadful voyage, filled with disappointment and disgust, but the Russian psyche has a way of turning human monstrosity into art. All that baroque emotion beaten down by years of oppression has prompted a numbness of spirit: pain becomes a tickle.|Fresh
But despite director Zvyagintsev's reliably sinuous, controlled filmmaking, Loveless too often comes off as just a relentless bummer.|Rotten
Beautiful cinematography perfectly captures the mood of the story. These visuals match the committed performances, especially by Spivak, who really nails it in one particularly shattering scene.|Fresh
Still, if Loveless is hard to love, neither is it easy to forget.|Fresh
Throughout the film, even chronic pessimists (like me!) will find themselves defending humanity.|Rotten
A stunning indictment of complacency, and a reminder of how fast something you love -- like our democracy -- can suddenly go poof if you look away, even for a second.|Fresh
The essential gut-rot of reality remains in full effect, and while the story isn't always easy to watch, what it has to say about the wreckage of divorce is profound.|Fresh
"""Loveless"" is hard to watch, but it does encourage hugging every child you see afterwards."|Fresh
Academy Award nominated film by Andrey Zvyagintsev of The Return and Leviathan has devastating power and haunting mystery|Fresh
"Featuring stunningly bleak cinematography from Mikhail Krichman (""The Return,"" ""Leviathan"") complemented by Evgeniy and Sacha Galperin's (""The Family"") stark score, ""Loveless"" offers a dark forecast for humanity."|Fresh
"...""Loveless"" offers the sort of critique of modern European life that directors like Haneke, Ruben stlund, and Yorgos Lanthinos are aiming for, without going overboard on misanthropy."|Fresh
"As I watched ""Loveless"" unfold, I kept wondering ""what about the boy?"" But, the film is about much more."|Fresh
For those willing to have their patience tested, Loveless does serve up a provocative examination of relationships and how toxicity can affect those closest to them. Just like the gray, colorless visual palette, it doesn't offer much optimism|Fresh
[Loveless] is a provocative one...|Fresh
Loveless can't be simply taken at face value, a mere marital drama steeped in dysfunction. Andrey Zvyagintsev is a Russian filmmaker, with seemingly equal emphasis placed on each word.|Fresh
Director Andrey Zvyaginstev (Leviathan) skillfully paints a powerful portrait of characters for whom self-interest trumps everything - even the welfare of a child.|Fresh
Another of Zvyagintsev's lacerating portraits of a country-and a world-in decline.|Fresh
If Mother Zheyna is a stand-in for Mother Russia, and Zvyagintsev bluntly suggests that she is, then this movie is one, big unflattering selfie.|Fresh
Director Zvyagintsev, who co-wrote the film, is intent on showing how calamity doesn't necessarily unite people - it can push them further apart.|Fresh
Loveless is a stark, taut, uniquely interesting drama filled with soul-less personas. This could possibly be appropriate to the particular community and to these specific characters than would be elsewhere, but at times feels a bit too alienating.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev has crafted another can't-miss portrait of apathy, the banality and ease of meanness, and a plaint on the Russian state's loveless people, as it were.|Fresh
It's a cherished cinematic clich that Russian films tend to dwell on the gloomy side, but filmmaker [Andrey] Zvyagintsev... gladly picks up that handy stereotype and bends it to his own purposes.|Fresh
Like Tarkovsky, Zvyagintsev is a master at layered meaning, using the stark images as a visual metaphor for the decay of the larger society.|Fresh
A slow, grim drama...|Fresh
Zvyagintsev's decors and locations and low gray skies and selfish faces and clinically precise framings and lightly lyrical camera movements are...his most profound: he's an adept of shifting mood via elemental, geometric means.|Fresh
The movie is not without its moments, especially its rare moments of quiet.|Fresh
Loveless is ultimately a test of patience.|Rotten
Loveless is far more focused in its critique of human nature|Fresh
Zvyagintsev and his sterling cast expertly paint the portrait of a family too blinded by selfish desires to see the pain they are causing others.|Fresh
It's not a pleasant ride, and if you've been party to an ugly divorce, it'll definitely set some uncomfortable memories rattling loose. But it's a gripping drama and a devastating character study.|Fresh
Its message isn't subtle, but it is delivered with deadly, haunting finality.|Fresh
His Oscar nom is unlikely to elicit Russian pride. Zvyagintsev shows Putin-era middle-class Moscow as a realm of vanity, hate and heartless neglect, amid a visual style of wintry wetness and desaturated landscapes.|Fresh
This is a film that's likely to stick with you because of its exceptional intensity.|Fresh
Yet another piece of exemplary filmmaking by Zvyagintsev. Here, he draws out tantalising performances from his cast, while making incredible use of elements beyond the frame of action to amplify seismic levels of human disquiet.|Fresh
Loveless, a sorry tale of marital breakdown, evokes a system bereft of structure or purpose, and a society ethically adrift. It's a grim masterpiece.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev has always been wildly ambitious, sometimes to a fault, and Loveless is perhaps his most encompassing indictment of Russian society.|Fresh
Multilayered storytelling and complex characters invigorate this thematically familiar domestic drama.|Fresh
Whatever is your politics, in Leviathan and Loveless, the director hands down generalizations of Russia, and like any generalization of this scope, those are borderline offensive in their simplifying-which is why no one should make them...|Rotten
[Andrey] Zvyagintsev overturns the idea of romantic redemption; not only is there lovelessness, there is also a frustrating inability to care for another grieving human.|Fresh
Don't expect an Oliver Twist-like ending.|Fresh
The casual cruelty that can arise in romantic relationships is on full display in Loveless, richly illustrated in the characterisations of Zhenya and Boris.|Fresh
There's something profoundly affecting in its ugly truths, a sliver that gets under the skin and stays there.|Fresh
It's relentlessly cold-hearted that you get the sense that Zhenya and Boris might prefer it if their son doesn't turn up - they are so deeply selfish and resentful of his existence..Loveless is a beautifully shot and elegantly constructed film.|Fresh
After his last two dissections of modern Russia, Zvyagintsev takes a more people-focused than system-exposing approach this time to laying bare his country's psychological fault lines.|Fresh
The filmmakers' purpose is social portraiture with a psychodynamic context.|Fresh
A couple goes looking for their missing son and exposes the corrupt soul of Putin-era Russian in an Oscar-nominated stunner that means to shake you and does.|Fresh
Though deliberately paced, Loveless keeps you riveted with gorgeously shot sequences of a volunteer search force fanning out through wintry landscapes-suburban woods, an abandoned hotel, an especially grim hospital.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev deploys the voluptuousness of his camera, avoiding the mechanisms of intrigue, to describe these increasingly internalized behaviors. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Loveless does not rise to the same dramatic intensity as Leviathan - its story and moral message is almost a little too simplistic - but it is still an excellently crafted film, a powerfully assembled portrait of a very unhappy family.|Fresh
A fiercely smart drama, its despairing mood sticks with you long after it ends.|Fresh
It's a forbidding but commanding film, ostensibly a missing-child procedural that plumes like ink in water into a corrosive critique on the beautiful monster that is Putin's Russia.|Fresh
A film that, with chilly precision, dissects the frozen corpse of a hollow society - personal, national and global.|Fresh
One feels in the film's punishing bleakness a yearning for transcendence.|Fresh
[Andrey] Zvyagintsev may have altered his register - where Leviathan was painted with a broad brush, Loveless is a scalpel dissection - but his message remains constant.|Fresh
The latest from Leviathan director Andrey Zvyagintsev is a fluffy romcom perfect for St Valentine's Day. Just kidding.|Fresh
It is magnificent.|Fresh
This is a shocking, compelling portrait of a heartless world, told with a surgeon's precision.|Fresh
The resulting procedural aspect of the film gives it gripping narrative drive, but it's the pitiless portrait of middle-class life in modern Russia that lingers longest.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev has said that the movie is a criticism of Putin's Russia, and of a materialistic society that has cut itself free from caring, but it works as straight drama too.|Fresh
Loveless is brilliantly accomplished and yet I found its unsparing pessimism hard going.|Fresh
It is a bleak film, but Zvyagintsev's artistry means that it is not just compelling, but more involving than you'd ever think possible, given the two main characters are so unceasingly terrible.|Fresh
[Andrey] Zvyagintsev layers on his themes of the inhumanity of man and the bleak effects of our self-obsessed culture, yet with the lightness of falling snow.|Fresh
The characters have no life beyond what they symbolise, including Alexey himself, whose absence is the biggest metaphor of them all: he's the lost innocence of a society deep in the throes of self-absorption.|Rotten
Though the filmmaking is good, the bleakness of the message is unremitting.|Fresh
Loveless isn't cheerful viewing at all but it is virtuoso filmmaking from one of the few contemporary directors whose work bears comparison with that of the great auteurs from an older era in arthouse cinema.|Fresh
As a missing-child procedural, the film is mesmerising. We traverse the steppes of despair, that vast, wintry landscape barren and obdurate.|Fresh
Expertly executed with a message that will echo in your ears.|Fresh
Come for the near-endless rows that convincingly carry the venom of a collapsed, resentful marriage; stay for the extended critique of Russia's contemporary spiritual vacancy.|Fresh
For all the deadened souls who throng the tale, the telling could not be more alive.|Fresh
The forcefulness of this dry and disturbing story is impossible to ignore. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
... Andrei Zvyagintsev is becoming one of the best directors of the moment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Surgical, sinister, always about to explode... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A great solidity and elegance. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The premise - the disappearance of the only child of a couple about to divorce - seems to be taken from a novel by Ruth Rendell. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Loveless's most crucial images are either captured from the ground up, trees spinning against the sky, or left in rooms and cars recently abandoned, attentive to the sudden quiet and pushing through windows for a closer look.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev and Oleg Negin's screenplay picks away at [the characters'] self-created illusions until we see the hard, depressing truth.|Fresh
Russia's Oscar entry finds cruel child abuse among parents, perhaps a metaphor for the country's present corruption.|Fresh
[Matvey] Novikov is on screen for only a few minutes and has little dialogue, but that's all this young actor needs to make a devastating impression.|Fresh
"But there's enough complex sadness and relatable need in ""Loveless"" to make it more than just a study of awful people."|Fresh
[Zvyagintsev] continues to solidify his place as one of the most important and original voices in world cinema.|Fresh
An uncompromising view of a disintegrating marriage in a morally bankrupt Russian world, its truthfulness not easy to watch but compelling throughout.|Fresh
Novikov is on screen for only a few minutes and has little dialogue, but that's all this young actor needs to make a devastating impression.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev ... uses a toxic marriage to paint a larger portrait of decay, dereliction and moral detachment.|Fresh
Family meltdown as allegory for national crisis.|Fresh
Hovers between personal drama and deep political allegory.|Fresh
A provocative parable with a sharp bite that tears the flesh.|Fresh
I don't remember the last time the title of a movie seemed so suitable for the story presented on screen. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
As in the best tradition of Italian neo-realism... Loveless picks up our central character from a crowd. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Loveless"" is, in the end, about western civilization turning into a numb, unemotional populace, one in which it is a burden to take care of a child and that your own happiness becomes more important than that of your own baby cub."|Fresh
Andrey Zvyagintsev's film suggests that when, and perhaps only when, the child vacates his place in the family, like a ghost, does the child manage to insert himself into the history of the family in an authentic way.|Fresh
Loveless definitely lives up to its title. This is a cold, calculated, emotionally distant film that has little to no interest of making you like any of its characters.|Fresh
Loveless is undeniably worth seeing for its performances, but the apparent insight into corruption in Russia feels lacking, with the storyline too cold to get truly invested in.|Fresh
With the brittle edge of its critique, Loveless' delicate craft keeps every frame impeccably framed and lit, and the no-holds-barred performances spark at every turn.|Fresh
For many viewers, what will remain stuck in their minds is not Loveless' critique of Putinism, but rather its relentless misogyny.|Rotten
This atmospheric allegory glacially hardens and forms the future of today's Russia becoming an icy, irresolvable thriller.|Fresh
A visually mesmerizing film, even as it captures a nightmarish situation.|Fresh
There's no one like Zvyagintsev at taking an already tense and heartbreaking situation into formally composed, emotionally brutal, absolutely astonishing territory.|Fresh
Rarely has a film's title been so apt and precise.|Fresh
Loveless is an unsparing portrait of an emotionally, ethically and physically ravaged country.|Fresh
Partly inspired by Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, Loveless captures the dying gasps of a toxic relationship in which a couple can no longer stand the sight of each other.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev narrates sharply the catharsis of such careless and selfish parents. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Zvyagintsev looks at his society with the same critical eye of his previous Leviathan (2014), albeit with less political scope. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Russian filmmaker builds a devastating critique of the active Soviet middle class. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The end is the worst that has delivered this talented director. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
We will not say it's a masterpiece, but it almost is. A very dark work without a doubt. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Zvagyintsev's bold confidence in the articulacy of a striking image and subtly suggestive sound is evident from the very opening moments.|Fresh
A film that puts his country (Russia) as the epitome of a moral collapse that leads to a complete destruction of all emotion, not from a start, but from indifference. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Loveless is so solid in its narrative construction and in the architecture of its metaphor that the images and dramatic dynamics of its characters barely breath. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Loveless is a film of remarkable savagery, an astounding depiction of suffering, cruelty and indifference that lingers with the soul.|Fresh
A successful glacial portrait of human behavior in present-day Russia. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A forceful parable on a depersonalized, commodified Russia and in which the only thing that matters is the uncertainty of the present. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This Russia has the accoutrements of material prosperity ... within the ugly superstructure left by the Soviet state, but no heart, no soul. Zvyagintsev shows us this with great formal clarity, a kind of mortified calm.|Fresh
One of Loveless' great strengths is how it cannily withholds clear emotional involvement with its characters-only to set us up for one blindsiding salvo at the end.|Fresh
Such a haunting experience that it remains absorbing even when it doesn't go anywhere.|Fresh
Loveless gives us a multicourse meal of social ills, too dispersed to feel like a thesis, yet too chilly to feel like a raw, unbridled tantrum.|Rotten
Zvyagintsev has a way of making even inert nature live on screen that recalls Tarkovsky, but if the imagery early on evokes fairy tales, this one is only grim.|Fresh
Yet another giant piece of filmmaking from this fascinating director.|Fresh
This is the downer as an art form, a feelbad film of gargantuan reach and effect, and a brave, horrified commentary on a whole nation.|Fresh
We have ... rarely encountered a film that so powerfully exercises Philip Larkin's argument about man handing misery on to man.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev's harsh truths, coupled with his uncharitable characterizations, still strike me as too obvious by half. But there are details here worth savoring ...|Fresh
The film's title may refer to the protagonists' marriage and its symbolic connotations, but it's also a perfect description of Zvyagintsev's treatment of his subject matter.|Rotten
The small story at hand offers an opaque but pitiless critique on the director's native Russia at large.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev is masterfully compiling a cinematic record of suffering, and the indifference surrounding and facilitating it.|Fresh
Zvyagintsev once again demonstrates his remarkable gift for creating perfectly formed dramatic microcosms that illustrate the bred-in-the-bone pathologies of Russian society.|Fresh
Spivak and Rozin play the dysfunctional couple to the hilt, but each in his own way, she much tougher and hard, he softer and more restrained.|Fresh
Takes an ominous, reverberating look not at the politics of Russia but at the crisis of empathy at the culture's core.|Fresh
