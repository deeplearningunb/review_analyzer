Lang's movie is that rare thing, a nail-biting soul-searcher. While M steers clear of analyzing deviance, it is startling in its musings on which punishment fits an inhuman crime.|Fresh
Our identification with [Lorre] as a psychopath is so complete it's hard to believe that while appearing before Fritz Lang's cameras in the daytime, he was, at night, acting as a comedian in a farce.|Fresh
Few films are gripping and effective 82 years after their original release, but this one surely is.|Fresh
This is a movie that dares to sympathize with a sick person, that risks making the monster real and us (in an era when Germany's cinema was still shellacked in canted angles and fanciful shadows).|Fresh
The moral issues are complex and deftly handled: Lorre is at once entirely innocent and absolutely evil. Lang's detached, modified expressionist style gives the action a plastic beauty.|Fresh
An extraordinary, good, impressive and strong talker. Again fine work by Fritz Lang, and his wife and helper, Thea von Harbou.|Fresh
"[VIDEO ESSAY] A precursor to the serial killer and policier genres, ""M"" is first and foremost a suspense thriller made all the more gripping because the identity of the killer is revealed in the first act."|Fresh
Lang's razor-sharp dissection of crime and punishment never puts a foot wrong.|Fresh
It is a cousin to the early Hitchcock of The Lodger, and I have always found something even something faintly Ealingesque about its cynicism and satire.|Fresh
You'll never look at a novelty balloon in the same way again.|Fresh
The movie looms over our cinema like a hand of consequence, haunting us with its austerity and power long after others have faded from the mind.|Fresh
Lang's film is a must-see for even a moderately ambitious film buff.|Fresh
Fritz Lang's acute use of objects, symbols, letters, and codes to decrypt a relatively simple narrative remains as perfect an example of pure cinema in the sound era as one is likely to find.|Fresh
Criterion has now released the quintessential edition of Fritz Lang's inscrutable masterpiece on Blu-ray.|Fresh
...a touchstone, one of those classics that infects the popular imagination to the point that it's really not necessary for most people to have actually seen it to recognize its signal moments ...|Fresh
M is responsible for some of the most memorable images and sequences in cinema history|Fresh
Fritz Lang entered the sound era with a bold expressionist thriller that captured the ugly mood of the years before the Third Reich.|Fresh
Put simply, without M to show the way, there might have been no subsequent films in which a hidden killer unmasks the ills of the society around him|Fresh
Fascinating early talkie that made Peter Lorre a star as child murderer hunted by all.|Fresh
Peter Lorre's finest performance, and a truly significant socially-themed film.|Fresh
|Fresh
Remarkable early look at scientific and police detection - and of a city in fear|Fresh
A subversive film, or more simply a movie brimming over with the ferment of Lang's imagination at its height? You choose.|Fresh

Even after 75 years, Fritz Lang's first German talkie works beautifully as a carefully constructed thriller and police procedural.|Fresh

M is the most dynamic profile of a serial killer in film.|Fresh
It's creepy and masterful with many indelible scenes and a knockout performance by Peter Lorre.|Fresh
Brooding and atmospheric, M has at its core all the salaciousness of ripped-from-the-headlines entertainment.|Fresh
It's clear that Lang was ahead of most of his peers in grasping the promise of the motion picture form.|Fresh
A rather cold masterpiece.|Fresh
one of the great film thrillers, a seminal exercise in combining suspense and social commentary|Fresh

very likely the greatest film of one of cinema's greatest directors|Fresh

[An] important film which rightly deserves its success.|Fresh

Fritz Lang's first sound film, his most chilling and provocative work, features Peter Lorre's greatest performance as a child molester and murderer.|Fresh
One of Lang's most impressive achievements|Fresh

Lorre's performance as a desperate killer who insists he can't help himself remains his finest hour on film.|Fresh
Peter Lorre became a recognized star as a result of this film and deservedly so, even though his speaking part was minimal and came only toward the end of the film.|Fresh
Fritz Lang's M is one of the great philosophical films, primarily because its anger and message are not bogged down in pretentious overtones with crush the story of the film, rendering it almost unwatchable a second time.|Fresh
M is one of director Lang's many greats.|Fresh
Images of Lorre's oversized, fearful eyes and the yanking of children from the streets by protective parents set the mood of this picture more effectively than any dialogue could.|Fresh
This astonishing movie represents an unsurpassed grand synthesis of storytelling.|Fresh
Arguably Fritz Lang's greatest cinematic achievement, this unnerving tale of deranged child-killer Hans Beckert (Lorre) stalking the dingy alleys and shadowy playscapes of Berlin is as riveting a piece of filmmaking as you're ever likely to see.|Fresh
The film grows more unsettling when it becomes apparent that the child killer Beckert is something of a child himself, forcing the audience into something beyond complicity, something dangerously close to identification.|Fresh
It's an impeccable film -- a model of psychological suspense and a stunning display of Lang's power and skill.|Fresh
The film doesn't ask for sympathy for the killer Franz Becker, but it asks for understanding: As he says in his own defense, he cannot escape or control the evil compulsions that overtake him.|Fresh
