While it does require some suspension of disbelief to enjoy, Baby Driver is a very entertaining, kinetic film.|Fresh
Great acting all around, and a special applause for director Wright for combining action, music and drama into one great movie.|Fresh
The film is driven by exceptional performances, dynamic action sequences and one of the best, most immersive movie soundtracks of the 21st century.|Fresh
Baby Driver is the most exhilarating and original film so far this year.|Fresh
A uniquely stylish blockbuster|Fresh
This is popcorn cinema of the highest order.|Fresh

A smooth cinematic adventure, Baby Driver is the kind of film you're going to want to watch over and over again.|Fresh
The plot is almost incidental, it feels like an excuse for the masterful and stunning display of action and rhythm. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In conclusion, Baby Driver has style for miles ... the whole thing is a sight-and-sound experience, a ride that doesn't let up and doesn't let you go.|Fresh
It's a shallow escapist fantasy and a send-up/celebration of a particular genre ... In short, it's a lot of fun and pretty cool...except when it isn't.|Fresh
People of color are picked off easily, like a retro horror film where the Black guy gets killed first.|Rotten
Edgar Wright basically specializes in movies that should be completely insufferable but actually turn out kind of great (see: Pilgrim, Scott)|Fresh
Baby Driver marks as somewhat of a departure from Wright's usual style, but it is still undeniably a film that could have only come from his mind.|Fresh
There are few films this year that will match Baby Driver in pure entertainment value, a high-octane action flick with the year's best soundtrack and ample humor and character to fuel the motorized mayhem.|Fresh
Edgar Wright has delivered a pedal to the floor, high octane action film with a pumping soundtrack and a superb cast that only adds to the fun.|Fresh
If this doesn't make you want to get behind the wheel and crank up the stereo, nothing will.|Fresh
A really, fun, interesting movie that proves Ansel Elgort is a star.|Fresh
Completely sober thought here, but the best concert to attend this week is [one where] the headliner is a filmmaker and automobiles are the tools of the band.|Fresh
Baby Driver offers a fresh take on an exhaustive premise, and delivers a star-making performance from Ansel Elgort. [It's] the sizzling solution to this summer's lack of heat.|Fresh
Edgar Wright has given us a firecracker of fun amidst a dull landscape of the same old, same old.|Fresh
"An infectiously joyous wild ride that is a testament to the saying, ""Let the music play."""|Fresh
Baby Driver is an homage to other big, great action heist movies, but it's ambitious as well... It is quirky and effective enough.|Fresh
It's thrilling filmmaking, a total blast, and rarely misses a beat.|Fresh
"As an action movie, ""Baby Driver"" is good, but as an action movie directed by Edgar Wright, it is disappointing."|Rotten
"Loud, fun, and with a soundtrack that complements the film in all the right ways, ""Baby Driver"" is like being on a roller coaster, with its twists and turns coming quick and a feeling of exhilaration unlike any other."|Fresh
Let me tell you, the film is just as fun, harmonious and right noted as the Simon and Garfunkel classic.|Fresh
It's an impressive high-wire act put on by a director who understands the power of human sincerity in the face of oppressive irony.|Fresh
In the end, the identity of this unique flick is behind the music and its effect on our lives. Music uplifts us, saddens us, angers us, but most importantly it keeps us moving. Two huge thumbs up for Edgar Wright...|Fresh
With just enough thinking to be thoughtful and just enough danger to feel dangerous, it's a rare balancing act that any film works as well as this does.|Fresh
It is perhaps appropriate that the last time we will (hopefully) ever have to look at Kevin Spacey's smug face is in a film that is as equally proud of itself.|Rotten
In a perfect world, this film makes all the money that is possible and is seen by audiences everywhere. Unfortunately, it'll be yet another film that doesn't get nearly as much attention as it truly deserves.|Fresh
Breakneck auto action matched with a stirring sound track, plus a freshly conceived central character -- this joy ride will keep a hip audience strapped to their seats.|Fresh
This is a director having the ride of his life, one going all out to bring the audience along in the passenger seat. Just don't look too closely at what is whizzing past, and you too will have a blast.|Fresh
But whether you're in it for the music or just for the ride, Baby Driver is an entertaining car movie with an engine and a beat.|Fresh
It's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but has serious elements. When the two come together, they actually come together quite well.|Fresh
This is quite possible the best film [Edgar Wright] has ever made.|Fresh
Edgar Wright's pedal-to-the-metal plus needle-to-the-vinyl action movie is a love letter to the never obsolete wonders of fast cars, pop music and crafty commercial/personal filmmaking.|Fresh
It's a real treat to see such a fantastic cast bounce off one another like they do here.|Fresh
It sounds like every noir-tinged crime movie since the 40s, but its a canny reconfiguration of boilerplate elements, made special by the way it taps into our music-saturated culture, using iPods and earbuds to fashion a seductive fantasy world.|Fresh
Turns out that this film is a crime actioner wrapped in a quirky musical rom-com, with music and songs informing nearly every scene.|Fresh
With Elgort channeling a pouty James Dean and mean Kevin Spacey at his very best, Baby Driver delivers the creativity this summer's films have been lacking.|Fresh
Wright has made a movie that showcases his incredible moviemaking talents and should be instantly included in the conversation with the best car chase/heist movies of all time.|Fresh
It's actually a drive-in movie made with art house lan.|Fresh
Wright has tapped a fuel-injected line into cinematic innovation. It's supercharged storytelling at its best.|Fresh
Baby Driver is the first movie of its kind and anything else that follows (unless it's also directed by Edgar Wright) will only be a pale, soulless, bland imitation|Fresh
Wright's ensemble cast has great comedic timing that, coupled with the percussive score and smooth action setpieces, will you ready to peel out of the local theater.|Fresh
...a game-changer for the genre.|Fresh
Baby Driver may not quite hit the heights of Shaun or Hot Fuzz, but it's bursting with invention, stunning action and killer tunes.|Fresh
An exciting mixture of traditional car chase action and modern storytelling conventions.|Fresh
Fast-paced, exhilarating and impeccably-cast, this action feature is one of the year's best offerings.|Fresh
Its obnoxious title aside, Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is possibly the heist, action film that modern pop culture was waiting for.|Fresh
Wright seems to be taking notes from Quentin Tarantino for his use of pop music to provide an aural bed of energy for the story to glide on. The problem is that Edgar Wright isn't anywhere near as gifted as Tarantino...|Rotten
Baby Driver is a great experiment in the heist-movie genre and with director Edgar Wright behind the wheel, you're sure to have a smooth ride.|Fresh
A playlist does not a movie make.|Rotten
... it's a breath of fresh air. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hot-Rod heaven.|Fresh
... the epitome cool... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It turns out to be one of the surprise treats of the summer. There are moments when it's so achingly cool, stylish or technically brilliant (and occasionally all three at once) you want to stand up and applaud.|Fresh
It's appropriate that Baby Driver is a quasi-jukebox musical-one whose marriage of jukebox and diner has been ingrained in the consciousness of American moviegoers.|Fresh
Hands down, the most thrilling, exhilarating, charming and original thing to hit screens in an age.|Fresh
Both Ansel Elgort and Lily James are talents on the rise, and deservingly so. There's something quite classic about them, and they bring a real presence to roles that could have been fun but superficial.|Fresh
Wright has affectionately lampooned the horror and action genres in the past, but Baby Driver proves he is now a legitimate action director in his own right.|Fresh
Baby Driver feels like Wright is elevating his own game, while tipping his hat to a host of his fellow big-league players.|Fresh
For a film that desperately throws everything on that screen, it leaves you wanting quite a bit more.|Rotten
An original project in a world full of sequels and remakes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Baby Driver is so poorly written on levels of plot, characterization and (especially) dialogue that Wright's typically first-rate craftsmanship fails to save it-and, in context, even becomes its own source of annoyance.|Rotten
If I call the film a particularly clear-cut example of style over substance, I am agreeing that the film turned out exactly the way writer-director Edgar Wright planned it.|Fresh
For the rest, on a dramatic level, Baby ... is a total failure: I could not have been less interested in the fate of the hero... [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
A classic story with an amazing energy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Edgar] Wright's love letter to the American cinematic tradition of cars and guns is an undeniable blast.|Fresh
For all its attempts at juxtaposing Baby's sweet dreams with the hard-core aspirations of the movie's band of miscreants, Baby Driver has no more staying power than an air kiss. The longer it goes on, the more fleeting its fleetness becomes.|Rotten
Baby Driver is the kind of bad boy that our mothers (and electric car enthusiasts) are always guilt-tripping us over. Which means you'll only love it more.|Fresh
Writer/director Edgar Wright's meticulousness and mastery takes a keen eye on first viewing to get a hint at the level of fastidious planning that went into every aspect of the film.|Fresh
An extremely original thriller, an action movie that, unlike most productions Hollywood releases year after year, left me excited and eager to run, drive, and yes, listen to music. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Baby Driver is another example (a practically perfect one) that cinema must be fresh and new, not the repetitive monstrosity in which it has become. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Baby Driver has more soul and also better action than innumerable movies of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film so entertaining that you will want to see it more than once. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The director, with his enthusiasm overwhelmed to impress the audience with his technical tricks and his impeccable editing work, extends the story unnecessarily and ends up offering a daring denouement. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Terrific, character-driven action comedy... Wright again shows his mastery of blending comedy with high-octane action.|Fresh
The film is not going to give you some great insight into the condition of man, but it is going to get you walking out the cinema with the urge to burn some rubber.|Fresh
Baby Driver is a hoot. It's also ridiculous bordering on preposterous, but it's the giddiest you'll feel in the theatre all summer.|Fresh
It may have been an excellent Hollywood entertainment film, but it ended up being slightly better than The Fast and The Furious. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The joy of Baby Driver is that, though you've seen versions of this story before, many times over, you've never seen it done quite like this.|Fresh
For the film, the ringing sound is an alarm: once the music stops, beware. The soul of Baby Driver dies with it.|Rotten
Baby Driver is a strikingly adventurous and bold action film.|Fresh
Even if you're not usually into movies featuring high-speed car chases and gratuitous violence - you'll want to give this one a shot.|Fresh
Hiding the emptiness and the hollowness of the story underneath a flashy hood of hits and misses, Baby Driver shines when moving at top speed.|Fresh
Baby Driver is a musical in its purest form; it doesn't matter if the characters don't sing or dance - the movie does it for them. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
Its blend of speed and music makes 'Baby Driver' one of the year's best films.|Fresh
A toe tapping, tire burning, hard talking, yet heartfelt masterwork of sound and fury.|Fresh
Baby Driver is a super fun action film that uses music as its hook as opposed to over-the-top stunts and special effects.|Fresh
the action is where Wright's film shines, as he puts the full pedal to the metal in returning us to the old-fashioned delights of real car chases through real streets with real cars doing seemingly impossible moves|Fresh
Fans of Wright's work will see plenty of Wright-isms here - the smash cuts, action cut to rock beats, nods to pop culture. That visual wit is now laid over a crime thriller.|Fresh
America gives Wright his boss tunes, his cinematic influences and a ticket to ride. There's also the risk of hubris attached to that freedom, as becomes apparent here.|Fresh
Baby Driver is a mix of La La Land, Fast and the Furious, Reservoir Dogs and The Blues Brothers. It's funny, exhilarating and entertaining, and definitely worth the ride.|Fresh
I walked into Baby Driver wanting, maybe even expecting, to see a film that -- like everything else Wright has made -- would be the stuff of a future cult. What I got was a film that was trying way too hard to be cool.|Rotten
The best thing about Baby Driver turns out to be its modest scale, favouring CGI-free action scenes filmed in broad daylight that feel downright refreshing.|Fresh
It's like La La Land meets Gun Crazy. With an irresistible dollop of humor and a dazzling show-off style.|Fresh
The movie equivalent of a disposable toe-tapping pop song: mostly pumping, thumping fun, but it just can't play on forever.|Fresh
[It] should appeal to almost every audience demographic: [it's got] tragedy, comedy, romance, action, fast cars, violence, musical credibility and an impressive cast. If there's one criticism, it is that Wright possibly drags things on a little too long.|Fresh
A little style goes a long way. Sometimes it can even get you across the finish line.|Fresh
It's all bolted together like clockwork, an assemblage of elements designed to arouse and engage an audience that needs a reason to stop looking at their phones.|Fresh
Almost every scene that doesn't have a car or a gun in it is cringe-worthy, but as an aesthetic rush and a fun romp it's worth taking in at the best cinema you can. You want to see and hear this thing properly.|Fresh
Baby Driver is too much the soulless good boy doing bad things; what it lacks in substance it can't hope to make up for in style.|Rotten
A remarkable turn for [director] Wright who creates a pulp masterpiece|Fresh
Baby Driver is, in a way, the natural culmination of the non-singing musical in recent years.|Fresh
The action film with the heart of a musical. Ask your local cinema to play it loud.|Fresh
As a storyteller and filmmaker, Edgar Wright has an uncanny knack for teasing the beautiful and whimsical out of even the most unlikely subject matter.|Fresh
[Wright's] latest film, Baby Driver, is the sort of rarity that grumps such as myself often complain Hollywood doesn't make any more. Which is to say: a genuine original.|Fresh
It's this shifting narrative tone that makes Baby Driver one of the most effective anxiety-inducing films out there.|Fresh
For a film so full of automotive iconography, it's a conclusion that remains frustratingly in the middle of the road.|Rotten
In Edgar Wright's glibly stylish drama, bank raids and getaways are carefully choreographed in time to the music. This is mildly interesting at first, but fails to disguise the fact that this is a bog-standard genre picture.|Fresh
In a nutshell, there is not enough of a sense of vulnerability or struggle to Baby, meaning we don't really care that much what ultimately happens to him either way. This is a cardinal sin in the writing of any protagonist.|Rotten
The influences are there, but Wright builds on and subverts them in his hugely entertaining movie, one of the most satisfying films of its type to emerge in quite a while.|Fresh
In Baby Driver, what begins slow amps up towards the third act until the last chase sequence leaves us a bit breathless.|Fresh
A gloriously entertaining epic obviously influenced by car-chase classics from Bullitt and Vanishing Point to Driver (especially) and The Blues Brothers but, nevertheless, just as obviously emanates from his pop-culture-crammed imagination.|Fresh
Even with those reservations, I absolutely loved Baby Driver: the marvelous soundtrack, the blending of music and choreographed movement, the car scenes that are so exciting that I thought I was being fed megadoses of caffeine.|Fresh
It takes a lot of effort to be effortlessly cool.|Fresh
Justin Bieber meets James Dean and Route 66 will never be the same.|Fresh
After eating exhaust fumes for the best part of two hours, this moviegoer left feeling decidedly queasy.|Rotten
Baby Driver rewrites the four-wheeled film textbook on how to tear up tarmac with style, substance and spectacularly syncopated stunts that just never, ever let up.|Fresh
From the very first chase sequence, the beauty in the heart-racing, dance-like choreography is evident and you're totally engrossed. There's no getting off this whirligig ride.|Fresh
It's been a while since we saw a crime thriller with such a healthy chance of making viewers smile.|Fresh
At its best, it affects us like adrenaline mixed with laughing gas. But when Baby Driver, like the Energizer bunny, keeps going and going and going (as with half of Wright's other films, it's 20 minutes too long), it manages to run on fumes.|Rotten
A fairy tale for pop cultists, by a pop cultist.|Fresh
Edgar Wright pumps up the jams in Baby Driver, the best car chase musical since The Blues Brothers. (Admittedly, it's a narrow genre.)|Fresh
A wonder during its first 30 minutes, but then doesn't know how to handle the arrival of new ingredients. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
A typically erratic effort from Edgar Wright...|Fresh
It's the incidentals that make Baby Driver something special, from the creatively conceived, meticulously scored car chases to the running joke about people's names and their use in songs.|Fresh
A musical more than a rubber-burner, Baby Driver is the La La Land of caper films, derivative and occasionally fun -- take that as praise if you loved La La Land.|Fresh
An unadulterated auteur w**k.|Fresh
Fun and funny, if not especially deep, Baby Driver is a movie and music lover's ultimate love letter to movies and music.|Fresh
Wright assumes viewers are paying close attention and love obscure references and deep cuts. Thankfully, his obsessions are incurably contagious.|Fresh
...the proverbial summer action movie, but done with enough wit and flair that you don't feel like you've seen it over and over again...|Fresh
High-concept and full of style, as well as brutal violence and hot cars, Baby Driver is the latest from writer-director Edgar Wright, and it's a welcome piece of original filmmaking in a summer of been-there, done-that franchises.|Fresh
...(some) in the audience won't be able to stomach the enormous plotholes in the script, but, for me, they were counterbalanced by the torrid pace. The romance is well done, due in large part to the scintillating performance of Lily James.|Fresh
Wright glosses over some plot points in the interest of getting on with things, but the car chases are the point, and they're terrific.|Fresh
Amongst the deluge of summer blockbuster and extended universe releases, Baby Driver is a breath of fresh cinematic air.|Fresh
Edgar Wright's car-chase thriller has so much va-va-voom it will leave you grinning with pleasure.|Fresh
Edgar Wright used to send up cinematic clichs with gusto and with huge humor. Here he just embraces them - and his sullen, unengaging hero - unironically.|Rotten
"Don't believe the hype. This is one bad ""'Driver."""|Rotten
A film that has a lot of style and attitude to be a big summer hit. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Superb stunt-driving, a sweet romance, a mess of clich's kaleidoscoped into hot-dang! storytelling, and the only thing missing is Prince's ""Baby Knows,"" and Patrick Swayze's ""Nobody puts baby in a corner!"""|Fresh
Edgar Wright's adrenaline-propelled, music-driven crime caper is a gas!|Fresh
The man behind 'Hot Fuzz' and 'Shaun of the Dead' has come up with another dandy action film with a comic twist, but this is no parody. This is a cut above the standard crime action drama, aided by Edgar Wright's comic touch.|Fresh
It sometimes misses its target, but it certainly keeps on firing with high velocity.|Fresh
Baby Driver is essentially one long shredding guitar solo of a film.|Fresh
Here's a prediction. First-year drama students will soon be Blu-Tacking the hell out of posters for Baby Driver, which will make Edgar Wright at once embarrassed and proud.|Fresh
A roaringly high-octane crime movie reminiscent of the best of Quentin Tarantino.|Fresh
While Wright is a master stylist, I'm still not convinced he is a great storyteller.|Fresh
It's when the horns and drums of the Button Down Brass's Tequila become gunfire, or the madness of Hocus Pocus by Focus drives a breathless chase, that Wright really puts his foot down, with exhilarating results.|Fresh
Everything has rhythm in Edgar Wright's Baby Driver, starting with its original premise, fresh execution and a soundtrack guaranteed to get pulses racing and feet tapping.|Fresh
...the music is something you feel. Music connects every scene, connects every character, every action flows from Wright's eclectic mix of tracks, all special in their own way.|Fresh
Between the character dynamics, the vehicular stuntwork, and the carefully chosen soundtrack, Baby Driver clicks on all cylinders -- at least until it hits the homestretch.|Fresh
Ansel Elgort bops around 'Baby Driver' like 'Saturday Night Fever's Tony Manero, with his ear buds semi-glued in. You keep expecting a few disco balls to pop into view while the Bee Gees let loose on the soundtrack.|Fresh
Baby Driver is a nice twist on an old car chase, car crash, bullets flying everywhere and hitting everyone but the main characters genre. Fun flick.|Fresh
Boisterous, crackerjack, bubblegum power-pop, adrenaline-stoking coolly-choreographed manic action, fragrant with delight in its own substantial craft, Edgar Wright's zooming genre riff Baby Driver is an epic car-chase confabulation.|Fresh
Baby Driver might not live entirely up to the hype, but that doesn't make it any less wonderful, Wright once again showing he's a fearless genre-busting directorial wunderkind who's creative gas tank overflows in originality.|Fresh
Baby Driver becomes an enjoyment for the palates of the connoisseurs and a joy for lovers of speed, shots, teen love stories, bastards dialogues and playlist wisdom. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Those who do give it a chance should find it to be the kind of pure cinematic adrenaline that will leave them giddy, thoroughly entertained and determined to rush off and tell someone about what they have just seen.|Fresh
...the edits and camera swerves are completely in sync with the songs.|Fresh
Baby Driver is a symphony of style, sound and story.|Fresh
A genre-crossing masterpiece with music on the brain and burnt rubber in its soul|Fresh
A pure visceral joy is written into the film's many set pieces, which have been shot without too many special effects and rolled out at breakneck speed.|Fresh
"It works like a charm, especially when Wright's alchemy is applied to some jaw-dropping chase scenes and in-camera car stunts that make the CGI cheating of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise look like amateur night."|Fresh
Go to the movies, sit down, be entertained for 113 minutes, crank up the car radio on the way home - with luck, on a perfectly clear summer night.|Fresh
The astonishing fluidity with which [Wright] puts together the music, editing, and performances gives Baby Driver the sensation of riding in a high-performance car with just the right song coming over the speakers. The world seems to fall into place.|Fresh
There are great movies you admire, and then there are great movies you admire that also make you deliriously happy. Baby Driver is the latter.|Fresh
Besides the chase sequences, what makes Baby Driver go is the hot potpourri of personalities Baby gets paired with.|Fresh
Edgar Wright picked the perfect actor to play Baby. Ansel Elgort slides into this character like it is a second skin.|Fresh
Edgar Wright has been an influential presence in cinema and once again, he delivers in spades with Baby Driver rocketing upwards into the higher echelons as one of the best films to come out of this year.|Fresh
This is the rare, unique entertainment that takes classic action tropes, and turbocharges them.|Fresh
It's a wild ride, a highly caffeinated tour de force filled with great action, lots of deadpan humor, and the kind of prevailing coolness that makes you want to drink espresso, troll vintage record stores, and watch old Steve McQueen films when it's over.|Fresh
It's pure candy for the eyes and ears, impeccably staged by writer-director Edgar Wright. And we don't mind much that there's not much more to it than that.|Fresh
Some of this film is a classic, and some of it's heartlessly superficial. Wright's obsessive cinephilia fuels both.|Fresh
Visually inventive and meticulously edited, it's as much a showcase for its characters on four wheels as those with two legs, providing a visceral excitement while toying with clichs.|Fresh
Wright calibrates the noises of sirens, squealing brakes, even gunshots to participate in its pop-to-punk playlists, bringing new bursts of inspiration to familiar tracks.|Fresh
Car-centric crime action is stylish, but shallow, violent.|Fresh
In some ways, it feels like a step backward, considering the maturity and pathos that made his previous picture, 'The World's End,' one of his best. Still, you can't blame a director for wanting to pause his growth and play with his shiny Hollywood toys.|Fresh
Fast, violent, and absurd - and the driving is a blast, performed by stunt drivers, not digital effects.|Fresh
The only bad part of Baby Driver is the title.|Fresh
With an intensely supercharged soundtrack driving the frantic editing in this way-cool heist flick, there isn't much fat left to gnaw off the bones by the time the action hits the curb in the final act.|Fresh
Well worth seeing on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible.|Fresh
Pedestrian is not the first word that springs to mind in connection with Edgar Wright's films, but no one has better captured the pleasure of walking while listening to pop music.|Fresh
The direction, cinematography, stunts, and soundtrack are the true star performers that make the film a fun ride. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
I've never been to the opera, nor have I ever seen a 90-piece orchestra play Beethoven. But I imagine this - the action in this movie - is what it must feel like. Baby Driver is symphonic. It's ecstatic. It's hypnotic. When it soars, it soars.|Fresh
A rollicking action/adventure/comedy/romance/musical that finds a dynamite angle and sticks with it. Here's a film that's fun, and totally unabashed about it.|Fresh
Baby Driver is often very entertaining but brace yourself for the violence.|Fresh
The disjointed plot of this fast and spurious jaunt frustrates at every corner taken in fifth gear.|Rotten
Within its small failures it would be an act of irresponsibility not to recognize the merits of the electrifying Baby Driver. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Baby Driver is just good enough to highlight the many ways it could've been a masterpiece.|Fresh
I mean, hot dayum!|Fresh
Too much works to get hung up on the misses - Wright's film is an absolute blast.|Fresh
Baby Driver is a blast of pure pop energy.|Fresh
It takes a scant five minutes for Baby Driver to feel like one of the best car-chase films of all time.|Fresh
What a fun and thrilling summertime romp|Fresh
Edgar Wright has delivered the film of the summer, and one of the best of the year, with Baby Driver, a heist movie that tips its hat to past classics while retaining an energy and style that's steadfastly its own.|Fresh
Baby Driver is an immersive thriller that seduces you to embrace its ridiculously fun excesses.|Fresh
I found the movie's slick, shiny surfaces entertaining to a point but once again wish this frustrating filmmaker would go as deep as his debut.|Fresh
The car-chase movie reinvented? Maybe, but it just hasn't been reinvented enough.|Rotten
England's Edgar Wright, already a critical and cult favorite, casts a glorious summertime spell with Baby Driver, a speed- and music-propelled gangster saga that transforms into a coming-of-age character study.|Fresh
This is summer action done right.|Fresh
Remember the visceral excitement you felt the first time you saw De Palma's Carrie, Scorsese's Raging Bull or Tarantino's Pulp Fiction...? Baby Driver induces the same reaction.|Fresh
If you fancy lots of rock 'n' roll choices in your movies, the latest from Brit Edgar Wright seriously steps on the classical gas.|Fresh
Elgort creates a thoroughly conflicted, likable character with all the vulnerabilities of a person befitting his youth who has to grow and grow up ridiculously fast.|Fresh
Edgar Wright has an uncanny ability to identify these weird little snippets of pop culture detritus and not only sample them, but in the process give them soul.|Fresh
As far as car chases go, Bullitt has no edge on this stylish fecal thriller.|Fresh
It delights me to report that Baby Driver is a monumental f---ing triumph. This is the best action movie of 2017 and the best thing Wright has done to date.|Fresh
It's a triumph. It's as lightweight as a souffl, yet as solid as a Ferrari. And it interweaves the inner and outer lives of its hero lightly but with real perception.|Fresh
So fun, oddly romantic, and revitalizes the film soundtrack|Fresh
Baby Driver is a frenetic, funky, fast and manic fun time at the movies you won't want to miss this summer.|Fresh
In a summer of yet more synthetic blockbusters, Baby Driver feels entirely original. This is jukebox filmmaking, a wildly energetic movie whose characters behave in line with the songs that fill its soundtrack.|Fresh
In Edgar Wright's Baby Driver, even the machine guns fire in time with the beat.|Fresh
If Walter Hill and Jean-Luc Godard had a movie baby, it'd look just like Baby Driver -- but it wouldn't sound half as good.|Fresh
The music helps distract viewers from the fact that they have no emotional investment in any of these characters or the story itself.|Rotten
Edgar Wright's crackling crime caper rises to the top of this summer's most entertaining movies. It satisfies my need for speed, baby.|Fresh
Lurching between mind-boggling car chases and a cliched young love subplot, the film starts strong and ends weak - both exhilarating and disappointing - but worth seeing for its razzle-dazzle, if mindless, action.|Fresh
Baby Driver is an exhilarating and tense thrill ride that's infectious with its high-octane energy, sheer creativity, and strong performances.|Fresh
Summer can finally start now: Baby Driver is that blast of energy we've all been waiting for.|Fresh
It's like a mediocre crime thriller crossed with several very good music videos.|Fresh
Driven by an infectious soundtrack and revved up action, 'Baby Driver' is a gas!|Fresh
"...there is a sequence at the beginning of the film that is pure ""Singin' in the Rain"" magic. It's a fantastic, absolutely fantastic car chase set perfectly to a pop tune."|Fresh
Baby Driver is sweet fantasy, unlike more violent and existential vehicular visions such as Drive or Bullitt. That means its two-bit thieves and criminal masterminds (Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey) are enjoyably cartoonish.|Fresh
The car chase scenes are the guts of this oddball movie, and they don't disappoint.|Fresh
A common criticism of blockbusters these days is a perceived lack of wit or invention -- the sense that big budgets and special effects are often used to paper over fundamental cracks. Baby Driver is an antidote to that feeling.|Fresh
Wright builds his script on the back of a killer soundtrack.|Fresh
Baby Driver should be seen simply because it is such a bold and wonderful idea. That's why I kind of hate to say that it doesn't pull it off fully.|Fresh
Baby Driver winks at our obsession with money and power, without actually winking at all. The film's palpably sincere heart saves it from being smarmy, and Wright's direction keeps the emotional arcs predictable, but pure.|Fresh

Fueled by a retro soundtrack and an anarchic spirit, Baby Driver is like Drive on speed.|Fresh
