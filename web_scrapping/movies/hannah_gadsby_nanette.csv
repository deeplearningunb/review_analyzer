Gadsby turns comedy on its head.|Fresh
It's not a repudiation of history, but it is a reminder that history is over and that the strategies that served us well at one time may not be appropriate today.|Fresh
Righteously angry, she shows us the real woman behind the amused persona we first met.|Fresh
It's a startling performance, moving slowly but inexorably from barbed sweetness to outright rage, and it should take most viewers, especially men, right out of their comfort zone.|Fresh
Nanette isn't for someone who wants to laugh a lung out, and yet it's something everyone should see.|Fresh
The beauty of this piece is found in its verbalization of what so many of us self-deprecators, professional and amateur alike, feel on a daily basis-a need to excuse our own existence.|Fresh
Gadsby's show is a tricksy, self-conscious beast, full of sleight of hand... It is a strange, rare thing: a comedy show that hopes you don't leave laughing.|Fresh
That story is both funny and horrible, and Gadsby has told it over and over again. But this time, she doesn't just want to laugh it off.|Fresh
The laughs of her show are a means to an end, which is, at its core, a ferocious attack on comedy itself.|Fresh
One of the things Gadsby is doing is exploring tools for telling stories, particularly stories of trauma.|Fresh

Gadsby refuses to alleviate the guilt of problematic white dudes, and I'm here for it.|Fresh
The laughs are a distant memory by the time the curtain falls, and you are left with an incredibly powerful message: This is my truth, tell me yours.|Fresh
Highly recommended, but fair warning: it's not just funny.|Fresh
Storytelling is important to Gadsby, and the biggest point she makes in the special is that we've been telling ourselves stories the wrong way.|Fresh
Gadsby invites us in, pushes us back. She reveals and withdraws and then finally, devastatingly, reveals so much that the pain and anger seeps from the screen. It is remarkable.|Fresh
What Gadsby does in this unassuming sneak attack is disassembly of the artistry and trick of comedy itself.|Fresh
It might not be the funniest routine you watch all year, but it's unique, and it will make you think.|Fresh
It's a powerful rejection of comedy itself.|Fresh
In Nanette we witness the shock of the new, a voice that dares to speak to this frustrating and often hideous cultural moment, a comedian willing to drop the act. I would call Gadsby a genius, but she would likely push back against that term.|Fresh
This is different. Not a little different, but totally different.|Fresh
Hannah Gadsby's Nanette is the mic drop to end all mic drops-a cross between comedy special and one-woman show that's actually a 69-minute Dear John letter to the entire enterprise of stand-up.|Fresh
A devastating, furious farewell.|Fresh
Art, Gadsby makes clear-from painting to comedy-does not liberate everyone equally. It can replicate the same privileges and exclusions as the culture in which it was made.|Fresh
In Nanette, Gadsby strains against the impulse to end every joke with a punchline. To diffuse the tension as such would be a cop-out. She wants the audience to sit with it...powerful, uncomfortable, and searingly angry.|Fresh
It is an extremely angry hour, an extremely cathartic one and an extremely necessary one. An art form cannot thrive if it refuses to look itself in the face and question its own necessity.|Fresh
Her finale is a blistering, impassioned plea for empathy, a furious call to action, and a battle cry to do better.|Fresh
I truly hope Hannah Gadsby doesn't quit comedy. The obvious irony of Nanette is that her finale has given her that push into mainstream attention and near-universal critical adoration.|Fresh
Standup is, at its core, about an understanding of the power of shared space. Nanette takes that shared space and bursts it open.|Fresh
In its rescrambling and redefining of what can take place on a comedy stage, it's a beast that other sets are going to have to contend with this year.|Fresh
Her observations are searing, scathing and very, very funny.|Fresh
Nanette is the kind of work that leaves you shaken. Not because it's really funny (it really is), or because it's equally heartbreaking, but because it finds a fusion of those two modes that's incandescent.|Fresh
A generation after Helen Reddy, Hannah Gadsby may not be your idea of a traditional woman. But she is still woman, and she is still human. Hear her roar.|Fresh
by the end of the special, you have reached into a well of past lives and trauma and experience - there are several Gadsbys onstage, even if we just see one.|Fresh
If you are wanting something to stake a claim to the most essential of-the-moment work of filmed entertainment for 2018, then Nanette is probably it.|Fresh
