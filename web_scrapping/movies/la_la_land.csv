...a vivid smorgasbord of color and life.|Fresh
La La Land is cute, pretty and fabulously entertaining but it's not happy ever after. Hollywood has broken many hearts. There are dreams and then there's reality - but the pull of Hollywood always wins in the end.|Fresh
La La Land plays like a big ole piece of MGM musical nostalgia. The musical numbers are impressive, with Stone and Gosling both showing incredible range. They sing. They dance. They act. And they do all three very well.|Fresh
La La Land falls ironically foul of the dialectic it is trying so ardently to dramatise.|Rotten
La La Land is a wonderfully entertaining throwback film that respects the legacy it's drawing from but keeps its eyes on the present.|Fresh
The film is a very good movie that is always flirting with greatness yet its songs fail impress on the same level as the intricate imagery on display.|Fresh
It pays [its predecessors] respectful tribute and, most importantly, imparts its nostalgic hankerings to the audience seeing it so that they will be compelled to revisit those old favorites again.|Fresh
It's a really, really fun movie.|Fresh
It's a lot of music and dancing in the movie and [the stars] aren't great at either; they're okay but not great.|Fresh
As much it is Chazelle's direction that powers the film, it is the chemistry of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone that ties it all together.|Fresh
La La Land shows us a Hollywood fable of failure and desperation dressed up with a fresh coat of new-wave earnestness and nostalgia.|Fresh
Chazelle has crafted a true modern day classic that reminds us of the power of possibility and of dreams, the belief in love and being in love. It's one of the very best films of the year.|Fresh
It's like a breath of fresh air.|Fresh
A gorgeously photographed, unashamedly nostalgic, bittersweet marriage of the modern and the traditional, proving Chazelle's fantastic eye for musical sequences.|Fresh
"""La La Land"" is a wonderful romp back into the dreamy time of Old Hollywood that will make you smile."|Fresh
"Charming, alluring, beautiful, and emotionally balanced, ""La La Land"" is more than a satisfying film; it's an enchanting experience."|Fresh
Borrowing (or repackaging) liberally from 20th century musical titans, La La Land often appears drunk on nostalgia... It's a traditionalist that so longs to be a revolutionary, but not really.|Rotten
It's an airy confection of delight that is at the same time wised-up and nostalgic. And it aims for a vision of moviemaking that is rhapsodic and earnest without being sentimental.|Fresh
La La Land is a throwback film that celebrates the way movies were made and the feelings that came with them, while simultaneously infusing that nostalgia into a glamorized modern Hollywood romance.|Fresh
The whole thing felt like such a waste of time. I squinted at the screen, trying in vain to find a point.|Rotten
When I wasn't charmed by the characters, I was transported by the film's playfulness. The camera bobs and weaves around like a jazz instrument. It's not content to simply film the content. It has to react to it as well.|Fresh
Here, the director is happy, but his characters are not.|Rotten
Damien Chazelle gives us a human film... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Visually stunning. It makes Los Angeles look a lot prettier than it actually does.|Fresh
Ambitious, hopeful and loving... a celebration of musical culture.|Fresh
From its exuberant opening musical number, set atop a traffic-jammed Los Angeles freeway overpass, La La Land announces its intention to win your heart through whimsy.|Fresh
Taking his love for jazz music, director/writer Damien Chazelle breathes new life into the old Hollywood musical genre much like 2011's The Artist did for silent cinema.|Fresh
This is totally a love letter to those old school movies with old school musicals of old-school Hollywood and it does it much better than movies who try to do it now.|Fresh
La La Land is the best movie I've ever seen.|Fresh
La La Land is a bit like its Oscar-winning song, City of Stars: it may seem slight, but in the end, it's the little things you remember most.|Fresh
La La Land may not reach the greatness of the classic musicals that Chazelle clearly adores, but to borrow from J.K. Simmons' jazz taskmaster in Whiplash: good job.|Fresh
"""La La Land"" serves not only as a paean to young love and the thousands of dreamers striving to catch a break every day in LA, but also as a beautiful tribute to the city at its magical best."|Fresh
One minute in and I was bewitched. And from there it just kept on getting better.|Fresh
... an original, distinctive, smart, witty work, whose use of its materials and allusions is utterly contemporary.|Fresh
Gosling and Stone are adorable; they comport themselves well enough at singing and dancing, and the effervescence of the work gives their somewhat amateurish routines a shaggy charm.|Fresh
Director Damien Chazelle shoots for the stars and then breathtakingly frames his leads dancing together in the moonlight|Fresh
If Gene Kelly, Woody Allen and Steve Martin had a chance to collaborate, the result might be La La Land, the remarkable new movie by precocious young writer/director Damien Chazelle.|Fresh
With its candy-coated color palette and Emma Stone's earth-shattering performance, there's plenty of love found within La La Land.|Fresh
To call La La Land amazing would be an understatement. Damien Chazelle's new LA-set musical is absolute perfection.|Fresh
Here it is: the musical that won an Oscar but had the statuette taken away one minute later.|Fresh
Gosling shines as a prickly Jazz purist, who conceals his emotions while Stone stands out as the sparkly girl, whose eyes speak a million words. Together they are magical and so is this eternal love ballad that will change the way you look at life.|Fresh
Gosling's effortless-looking performance is relaxed, understated and, thanks to months of piano lessons, totally convincing. But it's Stone who captures the heart, with a performance that runs the full emotional gamut.|Fresh
Stone and Gosling, at the top of their respective games, are delightful to watch together.|Fresh
The wayward side effect of casting Gosling as this jazz whisperer is that La La Land becomes a Trojan horse white-savior film.|Rotten
La La Land endeavors to show us that while it may take hard work and bitter sacrifice to reach our destination, every choice along the way, including whether or not to keep going, is up to the dreamer.|Fresh
It makes it more difficult to just let something like La La Land just passively wash over you when, however well-intentioned, the film hearkens back to a time when black humanity onscreen was deliberately hamstrung.|Rotten
La La Land may look like the world that we dream about, but it also understands the cruelty that can come out of (or undermine) those dreams.|Fresh
With Hollywood churning out comic book superheroes and sequels, La La Land is a welcome relief, one that is truly original and celebrates music.|Fresh
There is a reason that La La Land is the best film of the year.|Fresh
La La Land engaged my senses in the moment, and will certainly do so any time I watch it, but it will not linger like a haunting refrain. Sadly, it didn't go to my head.|Rotten
La La Land is a virtuoso production that gives us all something to sing (and dance) about.|Fresh
La La Land is actually a love story for jazz, with a leading male character who likes to mansplain very loudly and intently whenever he gets the chance about just how important jazz music is and how he will be the saviour jazz music needs.|Rotten
Writer/director Damien Chazelle's La La Land offers a delightful, exuberant indulgence in song and dance in the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers tradition.|Fresh
For all their crazy chemistry, the stars of Hollywood's new musical, La La Land, don't actually sing or dance all that well. Somewhat surprisingly, this actually makes the movie work.|Fresh
With its occasional forays into alternate realities and dreamy, keyed-up atmosphere, La La Land plays sort of like a cheerful Mulholland Dr., but shares none of that movie's cynicism.|Fresh
The movie has charm, at least, if nothing else. And as an attempt to pay homage to a vanishing world, La La Land is as dutiful as it is endearing - sweet, if a little sour, too.|Fresh
La La Land is unapologetically nostalgic for dreams, and the dream factory itself.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle's new musical, La La Land, lacks this secret sauce of musicals: his characters have no particular reason, no real urgency, for bursting into song.|Rotten
La La Land is a heartwarming, but not nauseating, story that will leave you feeling good when you walk out of the theater.|Fresh
La La Land touts itself as a love letter to movie musicals, but it fails to honor the memory of films like Singing In The Rain and West Side Story through its casting choices.|Rotten
While (the film has) an optimistic, positive message, it loses potency by showing just how little room there is for real life - with all its compromises and challenges - in the dreams of its main characters.|Rotten
This bittersweet musical valentine to Los Angeles - which stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling - is delivered with MGM magic and Jacques Demy's earthbound élan.|Fresh
Utterly justifying why it caused such a big song and dance. Joyous.|Fresh
It's a story as old as Hollywood and jazz, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone feel like a pairing for the ages.|Fresh
For all that, for all the time and effort the movie took, very little passion comes through.|Rotten
"""La La Land"" takes a city of broken dreams and gives us characters that are willing to take chances in spite of tasting that bitter pill of reality."|Fresh
It's a wonderful throwback to the golden era of musicals with a 21st century sheen.|Fresh
a bright, energetic, buzzy blast of show biz dreams and romantic fantasy, a classic story with a pair of beautiful and charismatic young stars... who meet cute, clash instantly, and dance their way to romance during a walk through the Hollywood Hills.|Fresh
With its gorgeous visuals, captivating narrative, and phenomenal music, La La Land easily earns its place as the very best film of 2016.|Fresh
La La Land reflects the classic musicals just like Peter Jackson's The Hobbit reflects The Lord of the Rings: you can recognize the inspiration, but can't avoid thinking the originals were much better. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
There are so many moments that left me wanting to clap with joy, and the ending managed to both break my swelling heart and make it swell again.|Fresh
Don't get me wrong, LA LA LAND is fun and cutesy, and made me leave the theater with a big, goofy smile on my face. But there's one distinct difference between good movie musicals and great movie musicals.|Fresh
In the end, La La Land is one of those rare achievements: a movie dream within a dream.|Fresh
A film with a scenic exuberance that resembles a patina in primary colors of the very vintage almanac of a disappeared and endearing world, and that tries to mythologize to Los Angeles like the capital of the dreams. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A huge, ambitious, color-soaked film, it's about 80 percent successful at following through on its goal to bring back the American musical.|Fresh
There's a melancholy to La La Land that makes it linger.|Fresh

It's a pity that La La Land fled from cliche to incur in what is consider cliche. At its best, the movie flirts with the ghosts of professional frustration, only to return to the most rude pretentions. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
La La Land gives two hours of pure and genuine entertainment that ratify Chazelle no longer as a promise but as one of the most talented directors on the current scene. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An imperfect film but with a lot of identity, and for the Hollywood atmosphere accustomed to formalities, that's very transcendental. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What makes these moments of mouth-a-gap wonder truly great is the beating heart of a love story that gives La La Land that depth and momentum and demands an investment of heart and soul. In Chazelle's hands, it's a safe investment indeed.|Fresh
La La Land is a beautiful modern homage to the classic musicals from yesteryear and a love letter to all those people struggling to follow their dreams. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film where every single piece clicks perfectly into place ... there are numerous moments that look and feel instantly iconic.|Fresh
The extended final sequence takes everything that has occurred and remakes it so that happiness seemingly lasts for both a few perfect moments and many years. It's incandescent and heartbreaking at the same time.|Fresh
A sophisticated tap routine on the tombs of the great masters of the genre, taking care not to destroy the tombstones. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
La La Land offers a warming, renewing sense of magic and hope in the world, the perfect antidote to all the chaos of the present. In the end it's an unapologetically bona fide love affair with love and dreams.|Fresh
A film that works like a fine string watch, like a soft and elegant mechanism that breathes the rhythm of jazz melancholy and classic dreams of Hollywood. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Chazelle's vision of LA is unnervingly whitewashed, and the film could do with another original song, but his inventive cinematography and joyous spirit will leave you inspired -- and dying to see what he does next.|Fresh

A fizzy surprise.|Fresh
A film that starts as an explosion of therapeutic vitality with contagious dance and music admirably filmed while telling a playful and warm love story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Chazelle has taken a big gamble with this homage. It could have turned out horribly twee and sentimental. Instead the picture celebrates a movie-making form from yesteryear with dazzling visual technique and a huge dollop of charm.|Fresh
It is simply a splendid continuation of cinema's ever-evolving love affair with song and dance.|Fresh
A marvel. Funny and exuberant and bittersweet and cliché-busting and unexpected as hell. We are going to need more movies like this one.|Fresh
Be prepared to go Ga Ga over La La.|Fresh
Sweet-natured in a time of often bitter cynicism, this buoyantly uplifting fable sets the soul soaring and the heart beating.|Fresh
It's not hard to see the appeal - or indeed admire the ambition of Chazelle, who's still in his early 30s (La La Land is only his third movie).|Fresh
Chazelle takes his cue from past masters of the musicals from Fred Astaire to Jacques Demy. He brings an infectious energy to a film that fizzes like vintage Champagne and has all the colour and sparkle of exploding fireworks.|Fresh
It's as gorgeous in its gloom as in its wonderfully shameless whimsy. It's a dizzying whirlwind of romance and sorrow, cinema to make you swoon.|Fresh
A film that will possibly become the last hero of a dying genre that everybody will be talking about, at least for a few years. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An absolute delight, a great musical and an exquisite chant dedicated to love. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
La La Land ravishes from densely populated beginning to eye-moistening denouement.|Fresh
It's too long, the music isn't great, and I can't stand all the brightly colored twirling skirts.|Rotten
The film is at its most convincing in those intimate exchanges between Gosling, with his melted eyes, and Stone, with her anime face.|Fresh
La La Land with caveats is still more wonderful than almost anything else.|Fresh
If it were any more enchanting, the musical romantic comedy La La Land ... would break your heart.|Fresh
The rare kind of spellbinding, wonderful film that has reviewers like me tripping over themselves to find new superlatives for describing it.|Fresh
Every moment of La La Land is worth living through because of Stone and Gosling, and Chazelle, whose direction is alive to the thrill of duets, first kisses and getting on with the show, even when you just want to cry backstage.|Fresh
An engaging yet far-from-flawless modern musical...|Fresh
A formidable film where Stone and Gosling will make you leave the cinema singing and dancing your frustrations away. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
La La Land is an ode to those who are brave enough to dream big and for that reason alone it deserves a standing ovation.|Fresh
It's almost impossible not to fall in love with Damien Chazelle's musical masterpiece La La Land.|Fresh
As a romance it's perfect -- mostly because the two leads have such incredible chemistry -- and as a musical it works even for those who don't love musicals.|Fresh
Chazelle's depiction of career conflict and erotic attraction in Mia and Sebastian's romance ... prevents La La Land from being a satisfying movie musical. He imitates the generic form but never imbues it with feeling.|Rotten
Open-hearted gushy romanticism in CinemaScope. What's not to love?|Fresh
Audacious, retro, funny and heartfelt, La La Land is the latest great musical for people who don't like musicals - and will slap a mile-wide smile across the most miserable of faces.|Fresh
Could have been a grand folly but instead it's just grand. Will make audiences break into grins like its characters break into song.|Fresh
Not just a bona fide masterpiece, but also the best film of the year bar none, capturing the true nature of Hollywood and Los Angeles in a way that's both unconventional and surprising.|Fresh
"La La Land is itself a hugely successful and joyous hybrid of the arts, or to quote the film's rousing opening song Another Day of Sun: ""a Technicolor world made out of music and machine""."|Fresh
For a film that easily could have just been ripe with clichés, La La Land is instead refreshingly different, and is sure to be a hit with audiences as a result.|Fresh
La La Land's song-and-dance never feels routine, knowing when to soar and when to come, tapping, down to earth.|Fresh
This is a colorful, energetic, vibrant, heartfelt throwback to this once wildly popular film genre, but the singing and dancing isn't really up to the level of the rest of the film.|Fresh
"""La La Land"" is a mirage, a self-satisfied illusion that tries and fails to sanctify a heap of classics that don't require its sanctification."|Rotten
La La Land is more a companion piece to Whiplash, expressing similarly ambivalent and conflicted attitudes to the creative process.|Fresh
La La Land is finely cut, A-grade nostalgia that proves nigh-on-impossible to resist.|Fresh

This delightful extravaganza revives the big-screen musical -- and how.|Fresh
"Trying to court Mia, Sebastian sings ""What a waste of lovely light."" Unfortunately, that's about the size of it."|Rotten
A modern lover story with a healthy dose of homage.|Fresh
It's a slight, often affecting story that mixes the confusion of contemporary life with nostalgic yearning for a time when the whole boy-meets-girl thing was less complicated.|Fresh
It's an easy film to enjoy, even love. But it's unwise to carry that love to any irrational extremes. Me? I'd be very careful tossing gold statues in its direction.|Fresh
Despite its failings, there's a lot of magic in this movie.|Fresh
La La Land shows that you can make a highly personal, intimate movie and still use the style of an old-fashioned, cast-of-hundreds musical.|Fresh
Anchored by the two great performances from its leads, terrific musical numbers and stylish direction, La La Land is a proper crowd-pleaser and a heartfelt salute to old Hollywood that harkens back to the past in order to create something fresh.|Fresh
Of course movie critics love this film; shamelessly referential, it clearly loves movies as much as we do. But don't let that scare you. Chazelle's filmmaking is at once virtuosic and instinctive.|Fresh
[Chazelle's] filmmaking exuberance and the energy and sweetness of his two stars give this thin soup considerable tang.|Fresh
No, you don't need to have seen any of [La La Land's] reference points to find it pleasurable and often exquisite entertainment.|Fresh
This is why we go to movies.|Fresh
Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are shaping up to be today's equivalent of Garland and Rooney, this third outing (after Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad) demonstrating yet again their chemistry and endearing camaraderie.|Fresh
Chazelle's graceful camera work is thrilling, his timing impeccably tied to sumptuous images that are as delightful as the leads on screen.|Fresh
Longing for an old Hollywood musical?... Look no further, movie fan.|Fresh
"...fans of 2011's big award winner 'The Artist' are in for a treat... greater than the sum of its parts. PG-13 for language and criminal use of the a-ha song ""Take On Me."""|Fresh
The cinematography and special effects are fantastic, but don't actually compensate for a weak storyline, and forgettable musical numbers.|Rotten
La La Land is a Christmas miracle for these coldhearted times: a vibrant and emotive present that warms the soul with good cheer as a celebration of a film genre and the indefatigable human spirit.|Fresh
With the first musical number in La La Land, I thought that I was in love. Unfortunately, as is the case with romance in the movie, holding onto that love was more difficult than I at first thought.|Fresh
Chazelle combines familiarity with wildly creative execution, proving that style is substance.|Fresh
One from the heart ... Chazelle doesn't for a moment wink at the viewer. He's guileless; he really believes in this trompe l'oeil world of violet sunsets, movie star murals, twinkly planetarium stars.|Fresh
I don't know if the music will still be sung in 20 or 30 years. I do know that dance schools all around the world are going to see a rush of enrolments.|Fresh
For those who know The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, it's a harmless curiosity, a workable but rather heavily implied time-travel voyage to 50 years ago; for those who don't, it will probably be incomprehensible.|Fresh
A renovated version of the old-fashioned movie musical about making it big in the City of Stars.|Fresh
La Land Land gives us the beauty of the world and its harder realities and intertwines them, leaving us with notes of grace and hope and love that transcend cynicism-bulldozes it, really. And that is lovely.|Fresh
As loving a valentine as the film is to old-school Hollywood, the rapturous reception it has received might be a collective reaction against Hollywood's current trends, as enjoyable, breezy and ceaselessly entertaining as it is.|Fresh
Easy on the eyes and tough on the heart, La La Land is a film I could watch again and again.|Fresh
Any concerns about the experimental nature of this film fantasy are blown away by the sheer talent and attractiveness of the stars.|Fresh
The ideal Christmas Day release gives the gift of its ever-engaging lead couple, music and director Damien Chazelle's surefire Oscar-bound craftsmanship for all to behold.|Fresh
...a film that tries too hard and is always showing how much it's straining.|Rotten
The mind-blowing opening scene is masterfully shot on the LA freeway.|Fresh
While there is much to recommend Damien Chazelle's ode to Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, there were times when I found myself curiously out of step with the rambling, retro production and the self-involved nature of the world in which it is set.|Fresh
The last quarter of La La Land is so beautifully shot and performed, it makes up for the flat opening. It becomes a film that embraces a world where dreamers may seem foolish but eventually are very interesting.|Fresh
La La Land has the best opening scene of the year. It has the best closing scene of the year. What's in between those scenes is merely incredible entertainment and expert filmmaking.|Fresh
Chazelle's film, with its unfettered embrace of the imperfect, creates nothing less than a vital symphony of the human condition.|Fresh
The film is full of color, brightness, rhythm and emotion. Although there's a narrative bump in the middle of it, the show gets back on track in a bittersweet, melancholic and radiant final. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sometimes a movie comes along that is so different, so refreshingly light, so right for the moment that people can happily forgive it for not being very good.|Rotten
I have yet to meet someone who's watched it and come out in a bad mood.|Fresh
The perfect movie for anyone who needs a bit of cheering up after a bruising year, La La Land is the cinematic equivalent of a really fun morphine trip.|Fresh
A clever, perfect film.|Fresh
La La Land is not just a musical, but a musical that loves musicals.|Fresh
To make an earnest, gleeful song-and-dance musical in 2016 with no political subtext or social commentary, not as a parody or deconstruction but simply as an old-fashioned ode to dreaming, is revolutionary.|Fresh
People say the movie musical is dead. Tell that that to your tapping toes while watching the enchantment of La La Land, one of the year's best films.|Fresh
The beauty of La La Land is that is uses an escapist format to tell a story about professional disappointment and the limitations of love. It's a romance for cynics.|Fresh
Almost anyone who happens to see it will be converted by minute three. Guaranteed.|Fresh
My heart goes out to Chazelle because of his desires; it sinks at how he's compromised them.|Rotten
A one-note bore.|Rotten
It's deeply derivative yet wholly original, an odd mix that will keep audiences on their toes.|Fresh
Audiences find themselves carried away. That may be sensible enough. What's odd is that La La Land is not the merry entertainment it sometimes seems to be.|Rotten
Simultaneously escaping into fantasy and reflecting reality, La La Land proves a big-hearted delight... dream-like in style but ultimately melancholy in sentiment.|Fresh
Stone and Gosling are the perfect pair to sing, soar and charm in La La Land. Now that your chance to see this standout film is finally here, don't miss out.|Fresh
La La Land's transportive reverie is its strength.|Fresh

Envisioning the best versions of ourselves in snappy musical numbers before reality crashes the party.|Fresh
It's simply impossible not to completely fall in love with.|Fresh
Chazelle has reinvigorated the big-screen musical by embracing the present while paying tribute to the past, by balancing irony and innocence, novelty and nostalgia.|Fresh
La La Land is a moving, melancholy musical that's very pleasant, if a bit thin; not unlike its appealing leads' voices.|Fresh
As effervescent as the finest bottle of champagne, La La Land is an intoxicating motion picture that should particularly please anyone whose heart skips a beat whenever Fred dances on the late show or Judy sings on TCM.|Fresh
This year's The Artist. So basically it's a superhero movie for middlebrows.|Rotten
"Damien Chazelle heard the call: ""Make musicals great again."" And he's responded bigly with ""La La Land,"" his dazzling display of spectacle and heart that will lock him up -- a front-row seat at the Oscars."|Fresh
Can one movie revive Hollywood's musical era AND bring old-fashioned courtship back to theaters? La La Land just might.|Fresh

Director/writer Damien Chazelle reinvents the Hollywood musical with style and class.|Fresh
La La Land's exhilarating and nearly unflagging energy strives to inspire in viewers an equally bold appreciation for all the things it celebrates.|Fresh
When the film ended, I floated out of the theater misty-eyed, cockeyed and starry-eyed. My feet haven't touched the ground since.|Fresh
"As fun as that opening scene may be, the story that follows is what makes ""La La Land"" a great movie."|Fresh
The result is enough to make you leap out of your seat and punch the air in triumph.|Fresh
La La Land is magnificent, Chazelle delivering a musical that instantly ranks alongside my favorites of the genre.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle, the writer/director behind the Oscar-nominated Whiplash, set out to make a musical romance, but his new film La La Land transcends both genres.|Fresh
The film's opening sequence is jaw-droppingly wonderful.|Fresh
A terrific modern day musical that often feels like and certainly harkens back to such genre pics of old. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Utterly captivating. A seismic event in contemporary American cinema.|Fresh
"The musical romance from writer-director Damien Chazelle is packed with ""movie magic,"" big, un-self-conscious moments where the characters burst off the screen in song and dance. This is a movie in love with movies."|Fresh
[Emma Stone] is so captivating as an actor that we are somehow attentive and interested through lousy songwriting and cliches.|Rotten
The film's highs are its light special effects and whimsical choreography. The ensemble cast is phenomenal, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling? Not so much.|Rotten
"""La La Land"" is a special, special experience, and movies like this don't come around too often."|Fresh
Much to my surprise, I quite enjoyed La La Land. And I imagine most moviegoers will too.|Fresh
You have been wronged far too often, I know; the movies have wronged us all. They have stood us up, left us alone on rainy curbs, but you must put your faith in them, one last time. You must run to La La Land.|Fresh
I could feel the large group of critics at the screening I attended sitting on their hands, resisting the uncouth impulse to applaud.|Fresh
Even with all the awards and Oscars hype, it still won't do enough justice to one of the decade's most magical masterpieces.|Fresh
Chazelle's deep and spacious romanticism includes the city and its dreamers and music and movies and love itself.|Fresh
The movie comes off as a well-intended tribute to the fabulous MGM musicals of the great Vincente Minnelli, made by people who have never seen one.|Fresh
The swooning, cotton-candy, luxuriantly pastel vibe...has a rather effortful feel, but for those old enough to remember the halcyon days of film musicals, it will be a treat.|Fresh
LA LA Land joins the ranks of other great, hard-working musicals that sit on the periphery of the cinema landscape ... a refreshing reminder that superheroes aren't the only people jumping around in spandex on screens these days.|Fresh
This is one crowd-pleaser worth getting behind.|Fresh
It's simply wonderful.|Fresh
La La Land is more than just a chance to bask in the warm nostalgia of Hollywood musicals. Chazelle captures a feeling reminiscent of the jazz Sebastian so admires: He takes what's familiar, tinkers with it, and creates something new and alive.|Fresh
The transition isn't always smooth; the movie sags in the center as the songs grow sparse. But there are virtues, too -- chiefly the proven screen chemistry between Stone and Gosling. (Their song-and-dance chops aren't half-bad, either.)|Fresh
Chazelle's vision to too candied to dismiss, but this extravagance demands more judicious editing, keeping the picture tight and tender. Its current slackness only emphasizes troubling casting faults and dramatic limitations.|Fresh
Techs are first rate from choreography to production design that creates the perceived fantasy of what LA represents to the young and eager.|Fresh
It's a shame about the rough start to La La Land, but does it really matter when the rest of the film is as assured and, at times, exhilarating as it is?|Fresh
I believe people when they say they are moved or enchanted by the film; it just didn't move or enchant me.|Rotten
La La Land suffers from what it endeavors to celebrate: Hollywood's flair for artifice and self-congratulation.|Fresh
Despite his tender years, Chazelle is a master of composition, color and camera movement, and there are shots here so drop-dead gorgeous you wonder how he and cinematographer Linus Sandgren pulled them off.|Fresh
Working together for the third time, Stone and Gosling quickly establish an easy rapport with one another, their surpassingly attractive physical features the perfect foils for Chazelle's aesthetic approach of naturalism and extreme stylization.|Fresh
Chazelle is a born filmmaker, and he doesn't settle for rehashing familiar bits from musicals we already love. He's too busy giving us reasons to fall for this one.|Fresh
"At a time when musicals seldom grace the big screen, ""La La Land"" is practically a miracle."|Fresh
Throughout the entirety of its running time, the film is alive like no other I have seen this year, reveling in its heightened reality and a pure love of cinema.|Fresh
(Director Damien) Chazelle has interwoven the innocence and idealism that permeated films in the genre with a contemporary, albeit, realistic vibe that skirts cynicism without passing over the line.|Fresh
The breathless 5 1/2-minute opening musical number in Damien Chazelle's La La Land is worth the price of admission all by itself.|Fresh
The musical numbers are distinctly Minnellian in their sense of lovers being swept away by the whirlwind of their mutual regard.|Fresh
It's almost criminal to have to stay in your seat when the contact high of La La Land is goosing you to grand jeté in the aisle. The heart, at least, is at liberty to swell to bursting.|Fresh
During one musical number, when fireworks start going off in the sky, you can feel them going off in your head too.|Fresh
The (Hollywood) Hills are alive again with the sound of (new) music, and it's impossible to not be swept up and away in the sweet sunshine of its movie magic.|Fresh
Chazelle creates a realm that suspends disbelief, forestalls cynicism and lets us open our hearts to emotion that's as real in this setting as in any naturalistic drama.|Fresh
It's a film for those who feel a little out of step with the 21st century, as Mia does with her love of classic cinema and Sebastian does with his angry jazz certainty. A lot of us can relate. If you can't, we don't really want to hear about it.|Fresh
It may not be a masterpiece, but it's a refreshing and unabashed joy-filled escape, and after such a woeful year, there is nothing wrong with that.|Fresh
If you have friends who say they don't make good movies anymore, drag them to this.|Fresh
A deft blend of long-gone filmmaking style with decidedly modern sensibilities, it's the kind of film you'll watch with a permanent smile plastered to your face.|Fresh
"As genres go in and out of style, the movies occasionally forget some of the wonderful things they can do. Luckily, ""La La Land"" remembers."|Fresh
Never have the glory days of Hollywood been reimagined quite like they are in the new film by writer-director Damien Chazelle.|Fresh
That not every note or dance step is perfect isn't the point; it's that the actors find perfection - and magic - in the moment, in that flight.|Fresh
La La Land is hopeful, even giddy. And Chazelle directs with heaps of style and charm.|Fresh
Relentlessly stunning and possibly life-altering.|Fresh
"We don't generally think of musicals in these terms, but, following the impersonal splashiness of the opening number, ""La La Land"" slowly dawns as a film of great intimacy. It's as if it were whispering to us."|Fresh
La La Land is a musical without grace.|Rotten
It's nostalgic in the same way a hipster combing through vinyl records in a record shop coffee house is nostalgic. It picks and chooses what it wants to remember about the past and puts a decidedly modern spin on the treasures it decides to keep.|Fresh
The one thing that Chazelle seems to have little interest in is life. He turns Mia into an absolute cipher, giving her nothing whatsoever to talk about.|Rotten
a magical movie about love and dreams|Fresh
An absolutely top-tier musical and glossy valentine to the simple, blunt-force emotions of classical Hollywood cinema.|Fresh
A spectacular, breathtaking, pulse-racing work of pop art.|Fresh
Buoyed by the charm and charisma of its talented stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, the film is a whirlwind of unbridled happiness that sweeps us away with music and colour.|Fresh
"I am a product of the big musicals of the '50's and '60's like ""Carousel"", ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""South Pacific"", ""West Side Story"", etc. and for me, ""La La Land"" doesn't come close."|Fresh
The two A-Listers have so much on-screen magnetism --- and they make a nice couple --- I'm willing to overlook their singing shortcomings.|Fresh
It's a picture filmmakers have propagated since time immemorial, a valentine to show business itself, and yet filmmaker Damien Chazelle renders it anew in La La Land, an original musical that pays tribute to the city and all it represents.|Fresh
A lovely, old-fashioned ode to dreamers and their dreams, the sacrifices they make to go after them, and the poignant regret of what could have been.|Fresh
La La Land always feel emotionally direct and natural, rather than cloying, playful or cute. If it's meta, it's also millennial.|Fresh
A modern love story filmed in a style reminiscent of glorious classic musicals, 'La La Land' emerges as a bittersweet treat for the eyes, the ears and the heart.|Fresh
Heartfelt and ambitious, it won't make you think, but it will put a smile on your face.|Fresh
I loved this movie, a sparkling homage to vintage Hollywood musicals, particularly An American in Paris, '50s Hollywood films, like Rebel Without a Cause, Astaire & Rogers dance movies of the '30s, and the City of Los Angeles, just to name a few.|Fresh
[Chazelle] is able to maintain enough distance from his influences to infuse the story with touches of realism that ground it while at the same time maintaining a sense of playful whimsy that made its forebears so successful.|Fresh
La La Land extends a hand to anyone scarred by a barrage of two-steps, jazz hands, and glitter costumes -- and bets are, you'll grab hold.|Fresh
As good as La La Land is throughout, the last act elevates the movie considerably. And while everything here has roots elsewhere, the way Chazelle strings these notes together somehow looks and sounds fresh and new.|Fresh
Writer/director Damien Chazelle, whose last film was Whiplash, has made a movie that's visually amazing, awash in vibrant colors, while the camera magnificently swirls around the stars as they sing and dance.|Fresh
The movie ends with a what-might-have-been fantasia that is one of the most emotionally moving passages I've ever seen in a musical. It's like a bluesy jazz piano chord, full of hurt and healing, that slowly fades to silence.|Fresh
Spectacular song-and-dance scenes rise up out of the story like exhalations of pure joy.|Fresh
Profound, beautiful film about love and creativity.|Fresh
For all its borrowing and bricolage, La La Land never feels like a backward-looking or unoriginal work. Even when not every one of its risks pays off the way that first song does, this movie is bold, vital, funny, and alive.|Fresh
Peppy, smart, and almost intolerably romantic, this is the finest movie musical since John Carney's 'Once.'|Fresh
... a musical so in love with love - and the movies - that only a stone cold heart will fail to get swept up in its glorious romance...The production is a marvel|Fresh
Visually gorgeous and deliciously colorful, La La Land is a romantically fueled, comically fun, and symphonically sublime treasure. You are guaranteed to leave with a smile on your face.|Fresh
It's more vibrant than Chicago, more heartfelt than Les Miserables, and more successfully staged than a chorus of other contenders.|Fresh
"""La La Land"" is as delightful and magical as you've heard -- a big, joyful celebration of old-school Hollywood musicals -- but it's also smarter, tougher, and sadder than its moonstruck trailer might suggest."|Fresh

La La Land is a full-service throwback to the Golden Age musical, transposed with lashings of romantic melancholy to a contemporary Los Angeles decked out in primary-colored plumage.|Fresh
Chazelle has assembled a vibrant, infectiously hummable pastiche of musical and cinematic styles - an entrancing ode to the glories of cinema past as well as a heartfelt expression of faith in the medium's future.|Fresh
Rejuvenating two tired genres, the romcom and the musical, La La Land amounts to an extravagant and improbable act of resistance against Hollywood convention.|Fresh
I'm hoping that La La Land will be a hit for the ages, for all ages. It's a film that re-enacts, with rare originality, a classic role for the movie medium -- escapist entertainment in troubled times.|Fresh
"As a candy-hued musical valentine to Los Angeles, ""La La Land"" is both a crowd-pleaser and a locals-only inside joke."|Fresh
Romantic, inventive, visually dazzling - and yet, Damien Chazelle's ambitious movie promises slightly more than it delivers.|Fresh
Song and dance in the key of life: That's the irresistible appeal of La La Land.|Fresh
It doesn't so much look back longingly at past masters like Vincente Minnelli, Nicholas Ray, Stanley Donen and Jacques Demy (to name a few) as tap into their mojo, insisting on their modernity and its own classicism in the same gesture.|Fresh
It's stunningly ambitious and thrillingly alive the way the best movies are.|Fresh
It isn't merely that Chazelle has made a film with eye-popping color and bold lighting, fantastical sets and characters showing their souls in movement and rhyme. He's made it feel revolutionary and brand new, even when it's as old as the hills.|Fresh
La La Land is a romance, and everyone is in love with everything -- most of all, old Hollywood dreams. It is, quite simply, magic.|Fresh
This unabashed mash note to the mind-melting majesty of the best movie musicals of yesteryear -- particular those from MGM's golden run in the 1950s -- is nothing less than the best movie of this year.|Fresh
I wish La La Land felt more like Chazelle's personal vision - that he tap-danced his own path - instead of this eager-to-please mash-up, the movie equivalent of samba tapas.|Rotten
One of the fizziest, dizziest, most delightful movie musicals to come around since Fred Astaire spun Ginger Rogers across soundstages.|Fresh
La La Land is probably going to win Best Picture at next year's Oscars.|Fresh
"""La La Land"" deserves credit for high spirits even if it's essentially a collection of glamorous throwback music videos for so-so songs."|Fresh
For a movie about chasing your dreams in a town known for crushing them, La La Land is surprisingly optimistic up until its bittersweet end.|Fresh
Again and again La La Land cuts to some vibrant vision, and it's often funnier about its outsize old-school ambitions than any cutting critic could be.|Fresh
"There's more to a Hollywood musical than the musical. There's fantasy. There's magic. There's a genre which isn't afraid to recreate what romance actually feels like. And that's where ""La La Land"" soars."|Fresh
If you only see one movie this year, you need to get out more. That being said, this endlessly enchanting, panoramic homage to the Hollywood musical is the picture to catch!|Fresh
La La does nothing less than jolt the movie musical to life for the 21st century. You leave exhilarated by Damien Chazelle's nonstop inventiveness, dazzled by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, and thrilled how they made movies magic again.|Fresh
Perfectly acceptable, sometimes overly strained, generally way too basic and, yes, periodically delightful, even at times devastating.|Fresh
More than just a thoroughly modern musical, Damien Chazelle's love story leaves us walking, well, dancing on air.|Fresh
Just when we were getting ready to write off Hollywood for solely producing noisy, cumbersome and soulless blockbusters, comes this aching, witty and unabashedly romantic musical.|Fresh
The closest thing since Cherbourg to a unified-field theory of music and film.|Fresh

Of the many fantasy spectacles in theaters this December, none are as marvelous as Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone dancing cheek to cheek.|Fresh
Every element of La La Land is bound up in a referentiality that largely precludes the outpourings of emotion we come to musicals for.|Rotten

La La Land is a joyous filmgoing experience, a musical brimming with optimism that never becomes treacly, ably directed by Whiplash's Damien Chazelle and featuring fantastic performances by leads Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.|Fresh
Damien Chazelle's musical love letter to Los Angeles manages to be old-fashioned and newfangled at the same time, to thrilling effect.|Fresh

The opening and closing dance numbers are so brilliant and uplifting that they are probably the best sequences in cinema all year.|Fresh
Giddily ambitious but perhaps more bittersweet than some will be expecting, this melodic love story proves fanciful but rooted, emotionally, in a reality where happily ever afters are not certainties.|Fresh
Stylishly directed and beautifully acted ... this is a gorgeously romantic modern-day musical that will have you grinning from ear to ear.|Fresh
"If you haven't succumbed to the joyous magic of La La Land by the end of the Fred-and-Ginger-flavored ""A Lovely Night,"" well, then, pick up your Official Curmudgeon badge and head for the exit."|Fresh
A wondrous, magical film that pays constant tribute to a century of musicals and Hollywood films about Hollywood, without ever succumbing to cliché. (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
