Florence Pugh's Katherine is a remarkably fresh and convincing depiction of how a young woman might act after being unwillingly sold into marriage.|Fresh
A Victorian chamber piece with a dubious morality and cautionary feminist designs.|Fresh
An extraordinary film with a compelling performance from Florence Pugh as the ruthless Katherine, too young and too impulsive as she realises her power. There is humour, too, often animal-related. How do you actually bury a dead horse?|Fresh
The film is all style and no substance. Many of the frames seem to exist solely for their aesthetic purpose, and the sexual and racial politics appear ever so juvenile.|Rotten
Lady Macbeth is symphony of horrible situations building to an unbelievable crescendo in one of the most intense movies of the year.|Fresh
The Brontës meet Gillian Flynn in Lady Macbeth, a tasty period noir that slithers with menace at each turn.|Fresh
Even when the viewers' sympathies are, hopefully, long gone, Katherine still has the utmost sympathy for herself, and it gives the film a psychological depth beyond the shock value of her actions.|Fresh
As provocative as it is defiantly stylised (no music score, dialogue is both spare and unsparing), this is not your typical costume drama in any shape or form.|Fresh
The film escapes the mere denunciation of patriarchy and is transformed into a tragedy that honors its Shakespearian roots. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Certainly an interesting option if you're into so-called art cinema. Give it a try. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is an oppressive and suffocating atmosphere for women, created with sober, star scenes, allowing director William Oldroyd to make an accurate portait of Katherin's psychological evolution without justifying or judging her. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lady Macbeth's minimal point of view is magnified and serves as a framework for a canvas that depicts impulses and passions. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Excellent and complex British film in which revenge and passion emanate from the same source. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...a character study of a ruthless and wily soul.|Fresh
Owing more to Bront and Highsmith than to Shakespeare, this grim moor noir presents its catalog of parricide, mariticide and equine-cide as the consequences of a class and caste system that dehumanizes even those who materially benefit from its design.|Fresh
[Lady Macbeth] is modern at the same time in the way it addresses femininity - more importantly, the power women have no matter how they're viewed by society or expected to behave by their male counterparts.|Fresh
Lady MacBeth is a costume drama that moves with the anxiety-inducing momentum of a thriller.|Fresh
The film begins as a domestic melodrama - the pretty bird trapped in a dark cage - and transforms into an ice-cold femme fatale noir...|Fresh
Opera and theater director William Oldroy's first film can not only appear with dignity on any best of the year list, but it is also a perverse accompaniment / contrast piece to the first film Jordan Peele directed [Get Out]. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lady Macbeth translates Russian history into the muddy English countryside. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director William Oldroyd's adaptation is an oxymoron of sorts, burning with rage and desire, yet so bone-chilling it gives frostbite.|Fresh
In Lady Macbeth, elements of both sexism and feminism are at play in the British drama.|Fresh
For all the murder and mayhem that ultimately ensue, Lady Macbeth is a quiet, measured film.|Fresh
The story of female oppression from William Oldroyd ... walks a careful line as the beauty who had been kept cooped up by her husband begins to show her strength.|Fresh
It's a tough old watch with performances that are good rather than great and with what, at first, appears to be fashionable ethnically blind casting eventually giving way to racist undercurrents that stir the already murky moral waters.|Fresh
Director William Oldroyd has breathed some fresh air to the staid old period drama, comfortably ratcheting mood and tension without any musical score.|Fresh
Utterly gripping.|Fresh
[Florence Pugh] delivers one of the truly mesmerising and memorable performances of the year as the compelling, conniving and at times chilling Katherine.|Fresh
... Lady Macbeth, under its Victorian petticoats, cuts savagely close to the bone.|Fresh
Like a Charlotte Bronte adaptation directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Utterly brilliant.|Fresh
This is not a movie to take to your heart, but as a psychological character study, it's both grueling and profound.|Fresh
[William] Oldroyd asks a lot of the relatively inexperienced [Florence] Pugh, and she nails it, a box of steely reserve constantly threatened with toppling.|Fresh
Unusual, uncomfortable, austere, and tragic, this drama film will likely give you the bitterest taste you've had this year in the movie theaters.|Fresh
Some have called this a nice change from the suffering female victim, but the other side of the coin shows a sociopath at work, not a great recommendation though Florence Pugh delivers a flawless, strong performance.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth pokes at the romanticized perspective of Victorian-set films, becoming more akin to a macabre neo-noir.|Fresh
...about as dark as films get.|Fresh
The cinematography rivets our attention with every frame, not just in the shocking murder scenes but also in the details.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth is an odd jumble of Gothic romance conventions, a storyline transplanted from a bleak Russian novella, and an attempt to address racial inequity that's too shallow to go beyond tokenism.|Rotten
Lady Macbeth's positive attributes are ultimately cancelled out by a middle that just doesn't, for the most part, work at all.|Rotten
This startling debut feature by British director William Oldroyd is a beautiful examination of passion, cruelty, manipulation, and downright nastiness.|Fresh
The result is cold and unconvincing, by turns dull and repellent.|Rotten
Another delicious repressed femme fatale. Erotically exploits the young woman archetype who only wants to satisfy her desires - the hell with the consequences.|Fresh
Dark, difficult and morally slippy, Lady Macbeth looks a little like Downton Abbey but plays more like Double Indemnity.|Fresh
What's ironic is that this darkest of tales is told in a uniquely beautiful manner.|Fresh
Like Downton Abbey, except more violent and totally deranged, featuring a star-making performance by Florence Pugh|Fresh
"It's certainly ""mean, mean, mean,"" as little kids might say, but its brief running time and that wicked performance from Florence Pugh make it mostly delectable, too."|Fresh
[Florence Pugh] makes Katherine a fascinating, unsettling character and gives Lady Macbeth an edge that will leave audiences breathless.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth -- an adaptation of a novella written by Nikolai Leskov -- offers lots of juicy, unexpected twists as Katherine's mental state spirals downward.|Fresh
Oldroyd's direction and Pugh's performance encourage the ambiguity, even as Katherine remains fierce and mesmerizing.|Fresh
The film industry better be warned: Hell hath no fury like Florence Pugh.|Fresh
Masterfully engrosses and disturbs in equal measure in its portrayal of a soul destroyed during the pursuit of freedom.|Fresh
A cross between a Jane Austen period piece and a Quentin Tarantino drama, Lady Macbeth is decidedly different.|Fresh
It's not my cup of bile.|Rotten
Katherine is played by Florence Pugh, another almost-newcomer, with a few slight credits to her name. But you'll be seeing more of her, no doubt, such a force is she in Lady Macbeth.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth strikes hard and digs deep.|Fresh
"Oldroyd deserves praise for some ingenious sailing with the prevailing winds. The British describe Jane Austen-mania as ""Bonnet tradition films."" At a quick glance Lady Macbeth looks like such a film, but it's colder, trickier and bloodier."|Fresh
If it sounds a little like a film noir transplanted to an English country house -  Double Indemnity  with whalebone corsets - that's not far off.|Fresh
It is a completely original adaptation of Leskov set in England -- never predictable in any way and, in its final inevitable scene, icily brilliant.|Fresh
Each scene is shot with intensity and precision by cinematographer Ari Wegner, and the dynamic editing helps to build tension in this dank environment.|Fresh
There's an intriguing story to be told here, but there's a better way to tell it. To borrow from the Bard, the spots in Lady Macbeth simply won't wash away.|Rotten
Attention to behavioral detail is extraordinary, led by a thunderous performance from Florence Pugh, who makes a mighty leap to industry visibility with her brave, dark, and thrillingly commanding work.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth is an acquired taste, but once you get it there's no denying you want more.|Fresh
A leak and brutally excellent new film -- echoing similar lessons from the equally savage, but less complex period piece The Beguiled.|Fresh
Despite director William Oldroyd's vengeful flair and admirable exploration of the tale's racial fissures, Lady Macbeth is memorable mainly for attempting to drown its audience in misery.|Rotten
It's impossible to root for Katherine. She fights back, for sure, but then she behaves more appallingly than her oppressors.|Rotten
Pugh, a young newcomer with just a tiny handful of film credits, gives a performance of rare ferocity.|Fresh
Much of the credit goes to Pugh, who's an obvious talent, with the kind of readable and expressive face the camera adores.|Fresh
If you do find yourself watching it for whatever reason, [Pugh's performance] is good enough to make you think, at least for a while, that the film as a whole, is better than it actually is.|Fresh
It is so calculated that you can see every shock from 3 miles out, and if it weren't for cold cruelty, Lady Macbeth would have no life at all.|Rotten
Pugh is terrifically fearless here; it will likely be her breakout role.|Fresh
It's smart about evil, especially about the way it tends to radiate.|Fresh
A corrosive, intelligent costume drama from first-time director William Oldroyd.|Fresh
...well done with some fine twists...could even be considered as a unique film noir, because it has most of the characteristics.|Fresh
Oldroyd never allows us to look away from the horror, focusing, in long, intense shots, on the faces of his characters as they suffer.|Fresh
"Throughout ""Lady Macbeth"" we see Pugh's eyes, full of possibility and optimism at the outset, gradually darken. Even her breathing changes. It's a wonderful performance in a very fine film."|Fresh
There's a twisted sense of logic to it, and that makes this story ... engaging -- even as the story follows that cruel logic to its inevitable result.|Fresh
The endless scenes of women being barked at, beaten, and dehumanized make this an unlikely date movie, but they lay the ground for a mighty revenge that earns the heroine her Shakespearean nickname.|Fresh
"Oldroyd's approach to ""Lady Macbeth"" guarantees some longueurs as the film wears on. But the clarity with which Pugh and Oldroyd communicate Katherine's thoughts and motives maintains a sold interest throughout."|Fresh
Pugh and the film around her hold an audience transfixed and conflicted to the end.|Fresh
A bold, unsettling transposition of Leskov's grim take on a Shakespearean motif-a promising debut for its director and a stunning breakthrough for its star.|Fresh
"Shot with unsparing coldness, ""Lady Macbeth"" is a disturbing character study and dark moral meditation. And like the blood on its namesake's hands, it's not easily washed out."|Fresh
Disturbing as it may be to audiences accustomed to genteel costumed dramas, Pugh's play-acting is an achievement to remember. And this Lady Macbeth, a nasty little piece of work, is a must-see.|Fresh
The leads aren't dazzling, but the story is cruelly efficient and chilling|Fresh
Pugh's and Ackie's performances here are electric and expressive, the former portraying ultimate power, the latter ultimate fear.|Fresh
Few movies this year will be more likely to molest your sleep.|Fresh
It is deeply disturbing and brilliantly acted. Not for the faint of heart --- it's a killer!|Fresh
Unleashes a brilliant young actress to the world of cinema.|Fresh
... an uneven exploration of gender politics and socioeconomic class, but Pugh is a powerhouse.|Fresh
One of the best, and most surprising, films of the year.|Fresh
You can't stop watching its beauty, even as you long to look away from its cruelty.|Fresh
Scene for increasingly horrifying scene, Lady Macbeth is about the making of a psychopath for whom bullying and betrayal have become learned behavior.|Fresh
"Katherine Lester is a complex character, something of a cross between ""Leave Her to Heaven's"" Gene Tierney and ""Wuthering Height's"" Catherine...Florence Pugh is mesmerizing as the defiant young woman who uses her wiles to get what she wants."|Fresh
As a reflection of the sick past in the cruel present, it glowers warningly -- an instant classic.|Fresh
The utter lack of tragic affect in its ostensibly disturbing final shot of Katherine sitting on a couch with an unrepentantly blank expression on her face exposes Lady Macbeth for the emptily portentous fraud it is.|Rotten
Katherine grows less plausible, and her motivations seem murkier as her cruelty escalates. She stars out as an avenging angel and then devolves into almost campy serial-killer criminality, the mixed tones leaving us insufficiently moved.|Rotten
Mr. Oldroyd boxes Katherine in his attractive visuals, imprisoning her as her male relatives do. Yet his intellectual distance also turns her into a specimen, a pinned butterfly turned taxidermy beast.|Fresh
Those expecting another date with Banquo, Macduff, and the gang are sure to be disappointed.|Rotten
Focused, precise and pitiless, just like its hero.|Fresh
The strength of the performances and the audacity of the subject matter are enough to keep Lady Macbeth riveting, with increasingly claustrophobic mise en scne and a breathlessly still soundtrack ...|Fresh
"Exact and exacting, made with formidable skill and unwavering focus, ""Lady Macbeth"" is a film that demands to be admired and cares little if you actually like it."|Fresh
Newcomer Florence Pugh, in a performance that will soon be legendary, dives deep into this terrifically twisted, erotic thriller and makes it matter.|Fresh
I'm not sure if I actually like this film but that just means it's filling its purpose.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth is a riveting 19th Century bodice-ripper that also manages to canvas issues of power, class, race and gender politics without labouring any of the aforementioned points.|Fresh
It eats into the mind with its vision of evil as a contagion that transforms victims into oppressors.|Fresh
A haunting, angry vision of feminine rebellion.|Fresh
Questions of her methods surely arise as the body count piles up. But as in a slave rebellion, her righteousness is never in doubt. Team Katherine forever.|Fresh
[A] striking directorial debut.|Fresh
Katherine feels disorientingly more modern than anyone around her, and the cold-blooded finale feels less like a true reckoning with moral character than the filmmakers seem to intend.|Rotten
There is an emptiness to Lady Macbeth, part of it on purpose and part of it not.|Rotten
Vengeance is served by a woman wronged.|Fresh
At the center of this tranquil nightmare stands Pugh, whose central performance is a thing of beautiful monstrousness.|Fresh
A stunning character study, an unnerving portrait of the female experience in the 19th century, and a tense psychodrama.|Fresh
Richly atmospheric and sometimes discomfittingly dark.|Fresh
Despite a questionable revision of the Leskov novella upon which the film is based, a most compelling work that prioritizes mis-en-scene over dialog.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth will not end up being seen by many - a period film based on a Russian novel based on Shakespeare isn't a box office draw - which is a shame because it's just such a hauntingly confronting film.|Fresh
Every stitch of every bloomer and ruff feels authentic but the energy feels current, even though the cinematography and editing is formal and precise. Crisp, thrilling, sometimes very funny, and sharp as milk thistle.|Fresh
It's a very grown-up film.|Fresh
Florence Pugh's performance and the film's unexpected approach to freewill and combating repression should suffice for an audience wanting their period dramas to be tougher and grittier than they expected.|Fresh
Theatre director William Oldroyd distinguishes himself with this feature debut, demonstrating a strong cinematic instinct, letting images work; they speak volumes.|Fresh
Shocking, powerful, raw... this is a film you will not forget.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth was clearly made on a very modest budget, but that very fact enhances its coldly beautiful austerity. It doesn't need all the trappings of the usual romantic melodrama set in this period of history. It's a fine piece of work.|Fresh
Bathed though it is in rough behavior and raw sexuality, Lady Macbeth maintains a minimalist discipline that chills the bone even while the action onscreen boils the blood.|Fresh
...the whole adds up to rather less than the sum of its parts.|Fresh
A film of genuine force, it strikes you in the gut with a clenched fist, simultaneously seduced by its beauty while recoiling at the moral abyss.|Fresh
Insinuating and bold, the film quickly worms its way under the skin, unnerving us to the core with its shocking story, clever camerawork and razor-sharp acting.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth is a deftly assured cinematic debut from theatre director William Oldroyd: a film of unnerving, accumulating tension, punctuated by moments of violence that leave you reeling.|Fresh
There are lots of moral issues raised: control vs freedom, freedom vs power, the crossing of moral boundaries and the notion that lust in women is akin to evil. I really liked it.|Fresh
Sometimes a glorious film appears like a cold dart out of an open sky.|Fresh
Directed with spare intensity by William Oldroyd, it's a picture as icily controlled as its heroine is wild and unpredictable.|Fresh
This may be a low-budget affair (reportedly less than 500,000), but it's as richly textured as any more expensive period piece.|Fresh
If there's a chillier Lady Macbeth than Florence Pugh's callous, scheming madam then we'll pass on the resultant heating bill.|Fresh
Pugh is outstandingly good as the spirited but ruthless young bride, who starts out as a seething victim before seizing control of her life in spectacular fashion.|Fresh
Pugh, aged 19 during Lady Macbeth's shoot, powerfully conjures a woman who, having escaped her trap, pulses with heedless, consuming sex and violence, and underlying, unrelenting desperation.|Fresh
An astonishing tale of privilege and power: stark, searing, and brutal, almost a Victorian companion to Get Out. Florence Pugh is a force of nature.|Fresh
Dark and disturbing, it's a tale that benefits from the simplicity of its telling and the frigid economy of the narrative.|Fresh
There's enough intrigue, tragedy, vaulting ambition and murderous intent to justify the implications of the title - and breakout star Florence Pugh really is transfixing in the lead.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth is daring cinema that will chill you to the bone and leave you rooting for its understandably immoral heroine.|Fresh
What a stunningly accomplished debut feature this is by William Oldroyd, with a remarkably compelling lead performance from Florence Pugh as a young Victorian woman trapped in a dreary and desperately unhappy arranged marriage.|Fresh
An impressive film debut from theatre director William Oldroyd with a chilling performance from Pugh.|Fresh
A British, period-set chamber thriller with a star-making turn on one side of the camera, and one hell of a directing debut on the other.|Fresh
Pugh is superb in the role: a powerful potion of rebellion, determination and lust.|Fresh
This circumvents all our expectations, plays like a thriller, ditches bonnets for more murderous pursuits, and is plain terrific.|Fresh
The film is a bleak offering... that begins dark and continues to get darker. As a result, it might not play to all tastes. But it remains a fiercely compelling and often shocking piece of work that lingers, if not haunts, for some time afterwards.|Fresh
This is a delightfully seditious film that hands patriarchy a right good kicking, and deservedly so.|Fresh
It could well open up a dark new avenue in the bonnets-and-bows world of classic literary adaptation.|Fresh
Exploring complex themes of oppression, morality and sexuality, this gripping costume drama has provocative modern day resonance.|Fresh
A deeply modern thriller borne from the 19th century, one whose traces of Hitchcock, Hardy and Haneke never obscure its huge originality.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth outclasses many of its peers in British period cinema, not because of its bold use of sex and violence, but because of its dramatic intelligence and its skill at filleting contemporary relevance from a classic literary source.|Fresh
William Oldroyd's riveting debut feature Lady Macbeth plays like a cross between Wuthering Heights and The Postman Always Rings Twice.|Fresh
Madame Bovary meets Thrse Raquin with a splash of Lady Chatterley in a pared-down drama that packs a real punch.|Fresh
This brilliantly feminist British indie film plunges a cold, sharp knife into the back of bonnet dramas.|Fresh
The performance from Pugh allows for this to remain an absorbing endeavour, and she's been gifted with a multi-faceted character to get her teeth into, so nuanced and intriguing.|Fresh
This intelligently scripted and imposingly played costume noir revisits the conventions of Victorian melodrama to comment on modern attitudes to oppression, prejudice and morality.|Fresh
The actors are good enough to convince even when the plot doesn't. A larger problem is that Lady Macbeth grows less psychologically plausible the higher the body count rises.|Rotten
Pugh is remarkable, exuding sensuality, determination and venom.|Fresh
A film that reconstructs an oppressive environment to break down its stiffness with increasingly refreshing spontaneity. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lady Macbeth eventually turns into a meaningless, mean-spirited, and proudly irredeemable non-character study.|Rotten
A fine showcase for the hypnotising Florence Pugh to veer from endearing puckishness to dangerously disturbed.|Fresh
The remarkable thing about Lady Macbeth... is that it refuses to allow the audience to have the emotional reactions we want to have.|Fresh
William Oldroyd directs a sexy, riveting thriller with audacity and a sure hand.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth begins as a biting tale of female empowerment but slowly reveals itself to be something much crueler. Period pieces rarely feel this contemporary.|Fresh
Screenwriter Alice Birch has cannily relocated the story from Russia to 19th-century Somerset, where the idyllic rural setting soon becomes more stifling than relaxing.|Fresh
"""Lady Macbeth"" reveals the essence of its plot in the title, but the dark twists of the thrilling narrative still manage to surprise."|Fresh
A quietly and compulsively watchable debut that's sure to send shivers down your spine.|Fresh
Just when you think you know this story, Oldroyd and Birch begin to show you that you don't.|Fresh
Despite William Oldroyd's formidable direction, his perspective on the material, as well as his point of empathy, wavers.|Rotten
Oldroyd's film ... provides a darkly humorous investigation into the Lady Macbeth archetype, though ultimately fails to sustain the initial nuance of its premise.|Rotten
A story about a woman like Cinderella that turns into something very close to Cersei Lannister after 90 minutes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is an auspicious and striking debut film that spells the start of a genuinely talented filmmaker.|Fresh
Florence Pugh announces herself as a major talent to watch in William Oldroyd's impressively tough-minded Victorian tragedy.|Fresh
Lady Macbeth mostly operates within established period conventions, but draws fresh blood from antique material thanks to a sparky cast, subtle nods to contemporary race and gender issues, and a hefty shot of gothic melodrama.|Fresh
A powerfully austere nineteenth-century drama, and an uncompromising attempt to make that rare thing, a genuine British art film.|Fresh
