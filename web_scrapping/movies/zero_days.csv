Fascinating and horrifying. A gripping detective story and an impassioned call for public debate over terrifying weapons that have already been loosed.|Fresh
The two-hour movie makes it disturbingly clear that our dependence on wired communication and integrated controls has left the whole planet vulnerable to countless manipulations.|Fresh
Be very afraid.|Fresh
A chilling expose of state-sponsored cyber warfare and the enemy within.|Fresh

Gibney's new cyber-war documentary brilliantly unpacks the story behind the Stuxnet virus, created by the CIA and US government to sabotage the Iran nuclear programme.|Fresh
[Gibney's] reveal is that one nation altered the [Stuxnet] code, which revealed it to other countries, which are now growing their unchecked cyber warfare capabilities.|Fresh
Cyber warfare policy is clearly a very complex issue. Director Alex Gibney makes a convincing argument that it is time for this to be brought out into the open so it can be fully examined and discussed.|Fresh
Provocative and unsettling documentary thriller on cyberwar.|Fresh
The visual intelligence at work everywhere in Zero Days allows a picture necessarily built on talking heads and streams of code to be surprisingly beautiful.|Fresh
...laying bare a hidden technological arms race...|Fresh
... becomes too dense with its historical context and geeky code talk, yet with regard to broader issues, the even-handed approach makes the impact more provocative.|Fresh
...a prescient warning for the new world of conflict we are blundering into without so much as a flashlight.|Fresh
An incredibly important documentary tracing the opening salvos of cyberwarfare which have been shrouded in secrecy.|Fresh
Unnerving and likely to give viewers some bitter food for thought, Zero Days is Gibney's most important work yet.|Fresh
Zero Days makes clear that we're already enmeshed in this terrifying new cyber-reality. And unfortunately for us all, we'll need more than John McClane to help avert forthcoming global disaster.|Fresh
StuxNet may have worked to slow down Iran's nuclear ambitions, but it also opened up a Pandora's Box of issues about how cyberwarfare is conducted, issues that can't be debated because of the terrifying secrecy around them.|Fresh
For many viewers, this will be crucial viewing from the technological and military frontier.|Fresh
While it lacks the pop fancies that made Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief such a success, Zero Days is Gibney's best documentary in years.|Fresh
Gibney is surely right in calling for open and informed debate about cyber warfare, but his own movie lacks transparency and persuasiveness. What a terrible moment for this director to go unclear.|Rotten
Very illuminating, and has most of the strengths and weaknesses present throughout Gibney's work (Splice Today)|Fresh
Alex Gibney's most thrilling, chilling and fulfilling film in years.|Fresh
Flawlessly spins what could have been a tech-talk heavy bore into an enthralling espionage thriller|Fresh
This is no dry position paper; he paces 'Zero Days' like a thriller, and a relentless one, throwing maps, graphics, context, and information at us with intensity and urgency.|Fresh
Another piece of investigative-journalism cinema from Alex Gibney. Talky and too long, but also terrifying and gripping.|Fresh
A techno-horror story of the sort the late Michael Crichton might have come up with -- but here the horror is real, not speculative, and it's still out there, lurking.|Fresh
"Though Stuxnet was introduced to the world in 2010, in many ways ""Zero Days"" could not be more timely ..."|Fresh
The most terrifying movie you will see this year.|Fresh
Director Alex Gibney does this vital material a disservice, giving it an air of deflated pomposity.|Rotten
In documentary filmmaking, as in news writing, there is a fine line between irresponsible alarmism and dispassionate reportage. And Mr. Gibney has a proven record of tiptoeing to the edge without going too far.|Fresh
Gibney delivers plenty to think about - and fear.|Fresh
"As critical as the message is in ""Zero Days,"" Gibney is just going through the motions here, with this feature adhering closely to his formula, becoming more of a lecture than a warning siren."|Rotten
"You'll want to see ""Zero Days""-just not when you're counting on a good night's sleep a few hours later."|Fresh
The future is now, Gibney's documentary persuasively argues, and what it holds for all of us is as scary to contemplate as it may be impossible to ward off.|Fresh
An ideal movie for Internet conspiracy theorists displeased with the powers that be, though Gibney deserves credit for doing more than just fanning the flames of paranoia.|Fresh
The Stuxnet story finally plays out like a twisty summer espionage thriller, with Gibney amping up that drama with sleek digital imagery and a foreboding musical score.|Fresh
Alex Gibney sounds the alarm on cyber-warfare with this compelling, disturbing documentary that employs state-of-the-art graphics and innovative dramatic feints.|Fresh
Fascinating film that doesn't blemish Gibney's peerless reputation as a cinematic truth-teller and dogged investigative journalist.|Fresh
It's a detective story. It's a spy thriller. It's a cautionary tale. And it's true.|Fresh
This is a world very few of us have familiarity with, which makes it all the more fascinating to learn about.|Fresh
The film is a two-hour investment and the rewards are a handful of facts and ideas that could have been expressed in half that time. But those who want more detail will find it here.|Rotten
Zero Days doesn't offer any answers, or even hope -- how could it? -- but at least it shines a light on a major, and majorly terrifying, issue.|Fresh
Gibney compiles an extensive montage of apologetic non-answers to his questions; after a while, it starts to seem a shame that another recent film already claimed Stonewall as a title.|Fresh
[Gibney] takes up the strategies he's used so skillfully in Taxi to the Dark Side... These back-and-forths are fun and energetic, the stories they reveal at once transfixing, preposterous, and melodramatic.|Fresh
Terrifying and essential ...|Fresh
"It is still chilling to hear that computer viruses can now cause ""real-world physical damage"" on a scale that experts would have laughed off as 'Hollywood-esque' just a decade ago."|Fresh
When you see a documentary as significant and as forcefully made as this, you wonder what you are doing watching any but the best dramas.|Fresh
"""Zero Days"" may be an investigation of the 2010 malware worm known as Stuxnet, but it does a much broader and more important job: relating the airless, abstract concepts of cyber-terrorism and internet espionage to their real-world consequences."|Fresh
[Gibney] handles this expansive, technically complex, and ethically abstract subject matter with remarkable cogency.|Fresh
Another fine offering from this prolific filmmaker, who hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. We certainly aren't complaining.|Fresh
As with We Steal Secrets, his 2013 Edward Snowden doc, the secrecy of this topic gives Gibney a cool, throbbing, spy-thriller aesthetic to paint with, and he trots through everything he can tell us with typical, value-for-money intelligence.|Fresh
Zero Days is an intriguing, disturbing watch.|Fresh
Because it wants to be a primer on a serious subject, an exciting cinematic expos and an argument for more openness and some kind of regulatory framework, the necessities of these different strands end up getting in each other's way.|Rotten
A must-see for anyone interested in how cybertech is changing politics; even if a more cool-headed analysis would be welcome in this informationally cluttered film.|Fresh
"While most people weren't looking, America went and changed the rules of engagement, and with ""Zero Days,"" Gibney urgently suggests how little time the world has to clarify its stand before the wrong party goes too far."|Fresh
