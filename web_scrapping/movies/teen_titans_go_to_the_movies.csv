Chock-a-block with vibrant toons, catchy tunes, and jokes aplenty, resulting in one of the more entertaining movies released this year.|Fresh
While this will be to some people's tastes, I found the film dull and, at points, irritating. Most of the meta-comedy jokes were a little too easy for me to truly find clever, and I probably only chuckled a couple of times.|Rotten
This summertime surprise took me from zero expectations to maximum fun in less than 84 minutes.|Fresh
Teen Titans GO! To The Movies is a film for fans, families and kids that doesn't waste a moment in providing laughs, heart warming scenes, new songs, and references to all things superheroes.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! To the Movies is the funniest film of the year. It is an absolute blast from beginning to end, and has a sense of humour that's even more savage to superhero films than the Deadpool movies.|Fresh
It's a film that not only plays to its target audience, but features enough laughs that the parents will be entertained as well.|Fresh
It's Deadpool, but for kids!|Fresh
One of the year's most refreshing surprise packages and exactly the breath of fresh levity that this cinematic universe desperately needs right now.|Fresh
"""Teen Titans Go! To the Movies"" is often a riot. If some of the sillier moments and action beats are clearly aimed at little kids, so many of the jokes are adult in nature, while never dirty."|Fresh
For those a little worn down by the one-two gloom fest of Justice League and Avengers: Infinity War, this is just the borax-poking tonic to make you feel good about caped crusaders again.|Fresh

The best way to describe the movie is super silly. It never really takes itself too seriously, and despite a couple dark jokes for adults, never really gets bleak.|Fresh
The Hollywood Teen Titans Go! initially looks more progressive than its real-life counterpart - but the climax gives this a rather different spin.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! To the Movies may be nothing more than a joke (a word that is so important in history). But at least it's a good joke. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Smart, self-deprecating humour and refusal to take itself seriously will make even the most sombre of adults smile.|Fresh
For a comedy for 8-year-olds this be this dedicated to nonsense humor just for the sheer joy of it... I tell you what, it gives a fella hope for future generations.|Fresh
It won't disappoint fans of the series and may even make those who are fed up with the genre laugh quite a bit. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
For the most part I found this movie just manic and annoying.|Rotten
I never, never, never ever thought I would say this... but Teen Titans did not only surprise me but...it's also the movie that we need right now.|Fresh
There are laughs-some of them tossed with a surprisingly flippant sense of the morbid-and energy galore, but it's all a kind of sugar rush. It's fun for about 22 minutes, but by minute 23, you'll be checking your watch.|Rotten
This film is full of self-referential humor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The strength of the Titans is their irreverence before the subgenre they represent, with formidable humor. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The simplest way to describe it would be a diet version of The LEGO Batman Movie: a film so self-referential it puts even Deadpool's fourth-wall-busting to shame.|Fresh
Surprisingly, this one is pretty fun. It's amusing, bright, and a triumph for DC Entertainment.|Fresh
It's all about the jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes.|Fresh
All the satire and humor is done with a cheerful, light touch. This movie is still designed for a specific audience, and it delivers many moments of just pure, joyous charm.|Fresh
The juvenile humor is sparse and instead targets the superhero movie genre in the most irreverent, meta way possible and it's relentlessly funny.|Fresh
I left the theater with a happy, peaceful feeling. I cannot remember the last movie that gave me that feeling, and I cannot wait to see it again.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! To the Movies is simultaneously a send-up of superhero movies and an homage to them, a spinoff whose music is infectious and jokes are consistently funny.|Fresh
Appropriately super.|Fresh
Silly, slapstick fun for youngsters - with a post-credit sequence touting the TV series.|Fresh
It's adventurous, a little juvenile, but 100 percent authentic.|Fresh
It's a darn good time - sure to make you laugh and fall in love with superheroes and all the shenanigans that come with the job.|Fresh
There are some pretty clever turns along the way, the look is bright and shiny enough to keep toddlers from getting restless, and there are enough self-referential in-jokes to amuse their older siblings and parents.|Fresh
It's unafraid of gearing its goofy charms towards the youngest of audiences, but even if you've never seen an episode of the show, this movie will win you over with its inspired lunacy.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! The Movies is a little too cocky and immature at times, even if we are talking about a PG film directed towards children, and it can also be surprisingly pretty damn dark.|Fresh
While [it] is a mixed bag, it's a fun, occasionally raucously funny satire...|Fresh
Viewers young and old might feel the unvaried flippancy and the flat visuals become a bit tiring, but there are definitely giggles to be had here.|Fresh
There is some sporadically clever fun to be had, but not enough to make it essential.|Fresh
It's probably a bit too smarty-pants for very young ones but will split the sides of their older siblings.|Fresh
This is busy stuff, full of knowing references to wider DC lore, and should please superhero nerds both big and small.|Fresh
'Teen Titans Go!' ... to a wacky, enjoyable movie.|Fresh
It's a constant reminder of not taking this stuff too seriously...at a certain point, you have to go, this is fantasy, this is escapism.|Fresh
It's encouraging to see someone at DC approaching this material as an opportunity for colourful fun rather than a grim matter of rights maintenance.|Fresh
This feature length version stays true to the show while actually improving on it.|Fresh
Aimed primarily at children, it's mildly ambitious but perhaps ultimately proves that its wannabe protagonists aren't ready for the big-screen spotlight.|Rotten
Lego Movie-esque in its sensibilities, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies is a breath of fresh air and an absolute delight.|Fresh
A hugely enjoyable family film. A typhoon of primary colours, larger than life characters and some razor sharp self-knowing humour - TTGTTM is the film to see this summer.|Fresh
The animation is deliberately unsophisticated, as are many of the jokes. But there are countless references that only clued-up adults will savour...|Fresh
It's aimed at kids but has a few jokes only grownups will get, and the plot is innately silly and inconsequential.|Fresh
The superhero movie we need, and also the one we karmically deserve. A riot of hilariously zippy animation that gleefully shreds the clich√©s of the genre while also lovingly embracing its self-referential geek experience.|Fresh
Smart and stupid in equal measure, this is a palate cleanser after the doom and gloom of Justice League. The Titans could make you fall back in love with the entire DC Universe.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! To The Movies may be unflaggingly daft, but outright silliness is rarely this smart.|Fresh
It's a riot of self-aware superhero japes that delivers plenty of big laughs.|Fresh
Spun off from a Cartoon Network TV series, this is a self-reflexive exercise.|Rotten
A fun and mildly diverting film.|Fresh
A hilarious ride to closing credits.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! is the takedown of comic book movies that is essential right now...one of the most satisfying superhero films in years, but also one of the funniest films of the summer.|Fresh
Ultimately, this is a film for kids with really cool moments, evenly spread throughout to keep the adult interested. Grown-up Easter eggs, if you will.|Fresh
Teen Titans GO! to the Movies is full of irreverent humor, self-deprecating punchlines, and a silliness that feels reminiscent of when you laughed at Animaniacs as a child.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! to the Movies is wildly entertaining and non-stop fun from beginning to end.|Fresh
If you're a superhero fan-or perhaps have superhero fatigue-this deliriously funny film will at least put a smile on your face.|Fresh
The plot is pretty predictable, but the silliness that swirls in and around each familiar twist is fresh and funny.|Fresh
Teen Titans GO! To the Movies is solid entertainment for the kids, but it's undermined by a thin story that only scratches the surface.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! To The Movies is a kids movie that is inviting adults to be in on the gag, not the other way around.|Fresh
Irreverent, immature comedy cleverly mocks superhero genre.|Fresh
I give this movie a lot of credit for actually having a lot of brains and heart... A genuinely enjoyable and funny movie.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! To The Movies is first and foremost concerned with making DC superheroes fun again.|Fresh
Goes solely for today's oversaturation of superheroes and jabs it for all its worth. In-jokes, Easter eggs, and background details abound throughout. I highly enjoyed this film. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Fortunately, all of the meta humor is a sweetness that keeps the film from becoming a post-modern mess.|Fresh
"Though it shares in the spirit of that kind of movie, it isn't quite as sharp or effective, but if you go in with modest expectations, ""Teen Titans Go! To the Movies"" should make for a pleasant surprise."|Fresh
If you're not well versed in pop culture minutiae you'll miss some of the movie's best gags.|Fresh
It's a broad, funny satire of comic-book movies and the culture's current obsession with them.|Fresh
It makes fun of itself and then it makes fun of itself for making fun of itself, and then it makes fun of us for watching so many superhero movies.|Fresh
Puerile.|Rotten
Meta comedy is the fuel that makes these Teen Titans go. In this respect, the film often plays more like an all-ages version of the recent Deadpool movies.|Fresh
"Nothing will ever make amends for the nearly perfect disaster of ""Green Lantern."" This comes close."|Fresh
The success of these cartoons comes down to a willingness to reinterpret characters with both visual and thematic adventurousness.|Fresh
With the same team of creators, directors and producers from the series... the film maintains the [same] characteristics as the animated television cartoon. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is deeply steeped in pop culture and in comic book references, but there's context. It's not just self referential, it's also commenting on itself in ways that are really subversive and really daring. I was shocked.|Fresh
LEGO Batman was a superhero comedy, too, but at least it felt like a movie instead of a series of hastily chopped-together shorts.|Rotten
Packed with an equal amount of fart gags and jokes about the modern state of superhero films, Teen Titans is a perfect bit of escapism for families suffering from superhero fatigue.|Fresh
If this silly, silly movie accomplishes nothing else, it has rendered it utterly impossible for anyone to depict Batman's origin onscreen, ever again, with a straight face.|Fresh
"Giddy with in-jokes, meta-moments and quick asides, ""Teen Titans Go! To the Movies"" is funny enough that you may just forgive its annoyingly placed exclamation point."|Fresh
The characters and the tone are so affable and engaging that the movie is never less than pleasant to watch.|Fresh
Peter Rida Michail and Aaron Horvath's Teen Titans Go! To the Movies is a spastic, Mad magazine-style parody of comic-book movies for the age of superhero overload.|Fresh
Gets most of the way there, only running out of gas in the third act, which is surprising, because this film loves gas.|Fresh
"""Teen Titans"" never reaches that sweet spot where adult and kid humor align in a single gag."|Rotten
A superhero spoof that aims for the saucy irreverence of 'The Lego Batman Movie' but despite some inspired moments doesn't quite hit the target, though an anarchic spirit and gaudy animation that takes its style from Japanese anime help.|Rotten
Teen Titans Go! To the Movies simply goes for it again and again, with excellent results.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! To the Movies is a product with enough ingenuity to entertain the little ones, share complicit glances with the most adult audience and for the same price leave us some other Interesting reflections... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Its meta take on its own existence and that of other superhero films make it smarter than many of its targets.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! to the Movies sticks a pin in the super-inflated pomposity of comic-book movies and the people who get so worked up over them. It's a reminder that these movies are supposed to be fun - and this one certainly is.|Fresh
This is next-level potty humor with poop jokes coming so often that it's humanly impossible to continue rolling your eyes throughout.|Rotten
A blast! One of summer's biggest surprises. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's funniest superhero movie of the year.|Fresh
The greatest strength of Go To The Movies is that it respects the kids in the audience enough to let gags... land without undercutting how absurd they are.|Fresh
This one made me LOL more times than I care to admit. Nice job, kiddos.|Fresh
Like most good animated movies, there's something in it for everyone... even a Stan Lee cameo that sends the best possible message to comic book fandom; forget label wars, let's just celebrate what's good no matter its creator.|Fresh
A far more affectionate portrait of comic books than any of the 'serious' DC movies|Fresh
An infectiously goofy film, but also deceptively smart about why we love comic book heroes and the amount of stupidity we're willing to accept within the genre.|Fresh
Never wears out its welcome, from the hilarious skewering of some of DC's most sacred cows to a range of musical numbers that include an 80s-style you-can-do-it anthem (compete with sax solo) and hip-hop-flavored self-aggrandizement.|Fresh
An irreverent spoof of the superhero genre that's certain to delight the whole family!|Fresh
Teen TitansGo! to the Movies will delight audiences of all ages and remind us of the value of friendship, waffles, and superbly delivered jokes about the entertainment industry.|Fresh
It's no small compliment to say that the feature film derived from Teen Titans Go!, a popular children's animated series, often proves far more enjoyable than the grown-up superhero blockbusters it spoofs.|Fresh
Teen Titans Go! To the Movies is one of the biggest surprises at the movies this summer. In fact, it's downright super.|Fresh
A brash and blithe-spirited animated comedy adventure for kids.|Fresh
With its self-aware meta humor the movie is very much a Deadpool for kids -- with direct nods to Ryan Reynolds' franchise for good measure.|Fresh
Teen Titans GO! to the Movies might be aimed at fans of the manic and underrated Cartoon Network show but any parent who tags along will likely chortle as the film gleefully skewers the world of superheroes and the film industry itself.|Fresh
A gleefully unhinged deconstruction of superhero tropes.|Fresh
This is wonderfully irreverent, totally meta and absolutely hysterical. It's not only a remarkably solid superhero movie, but also a side-splitting animated triumph.|Fresh
If you are even remotely a superhero fan, you'll find something to enjoy in this big screen take on this popular series.|Fresh
For anyone who thinks superhero movies take themselves just a little too seriously, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies is refreshingly irreverent, and family friendly too.|Fresh
