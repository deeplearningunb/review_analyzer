The greatness of a fantastic film is measured in its capacity of delirium and Yeon achieves it in the climatic actions. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that has a protagonist with a conventional dramatic arc, but everything that surrounds this predictable characterization is pure imaginative fire, served with devilish dominion of the filmic space. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

The very definition of a mondo midnight movie!|Fresh
Often it's the simplest ideas that are the most ingenious. Get this one: zombies... on a train. That's it. Ingenious. And, amazingly, the South Korean film 'Train to Busan' gets just about everything right with this scenario.|Fresh

A film that is presented as a hyperrealistic comic that plays with all the clich√©s of the subgenre, to subvert and reinvent it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

It has one of the most memorable shots of 2016. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
One of the greatest zombie films of the twentieth century that retakes interesting elements of this type of cinema: criticism. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that has topics such as child orphanhood, the difficulty of fatherhood and has a good execution of action scenes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Claustrophobic and full of movement at the same time. Without a doubt, one of the best zombie movies of the year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
If there's something to complain about Train to Busan is that suddenly becomes cheesy, but even thought it's an excellent horror movie and never collapses. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A zombie film with lots of action and suspense that makes good use of its own atmosphere. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An ambitious film of unique qualities in many ways, but doesn't manages to meet its own goals. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
As with Romero's still-peerless original, Train to Busan infects its zombie DNA with a keen social and political awareness.|Fresh
An action-packed, zombie-focused dissection of class clashes and today's me-first mindset that its formulaic concept won't quite prepare you for.|Fresh
An honest film, which leaves no room for deception or attempts to innovate the genre, putting all its energy into a frenetic roller coaster of action, full of extreme situations and the right doses of gore. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Train to Busan is an intense and intimate thrill ride that plays like Snakes on a Plane meets 28 Days Later.|Fresh
Mixing Snowpiercer with zombies, this fast-paced and surprisingly emotionally effective thriller breathes a bit more life into what's an exhausted horror sub-genre due to effective direction from writer/director Sang-ho Yeon.|Fresh
Train to Busan is the year's best genre offering by a zombie mile.|Fresh
Characters you can't help but care about? Check. A spot of amped-up social commentary? Double check. Lashings of bloody, bite-y mayhem? Triple check.|Fresh
Writer/director Sang-ho Yeon is stronger in the action scenes than in the emotional and social ones but overall delivers a largely exciting, sometimes funny and zombie thriller-drama with some fantastic shots and set pieces.|Fresh
Moving nimbly from the confrontational animation of The King of Pigs and The Fake to the more mainstream live action of Train to Busan, Yeon retains a sharp graphic sensibility that pays snappy dividends.|Fresh
This is one of the most breathless action thrillers in recent memory, propelling the audience through its story at the same breakneck speed as the bullet train on which it takes place.|Fresh
A stylish, exciting film that deserves a decent audience.|Fresh
Teeth-grindingly terrifying though the film is, it's no out-and-out gorefest.|Fresh
The scares would mean nothing, though, if Yeon also didn't invest some heart into the characters... That dose of humanity propels Train to Busan beyond the usual meat-grinder horror fare.|Fresh
The zombie movie takes the bullet train in Train to Busan, a smart horror that contrasts the hyper-cleanliness and efficiency of South Korean life with bloody, neck-biting chaos.|Fresh
Sang-ho can't quite resist a last-minute lurch towards sentimentality, but for the most part he keeps this moveable feast for the undead on track with relentless and bloody carnage.|Fresh

Since almost all of Train to Busan takes place inside railway compartments, comparisons to South Korean auteur Bong Joon Ho's English language debut Snowpiercer are inevitable. That is where Train to Busan comes up short.|Rotten
Train to Busan is one of the best surprises of the year; a redemption tale that reminds us how close we are to losing our humanity, but also the compassion we are capable of. All aboard.|Fresh
A film that offers a crude and critical view of man's humanity in moments of despair, talking about selfishness and companionship in adverse situations. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Here both zombies and train come to symbolise the blind forward momentum of an all-consuming capitalism, unchecked by the brake of any social principle.|Fresh
A cracking good time at the movies. Inventive, even daring, and barely a predictable moment in its 118 minutes.|Fresh
This is the film that World War Z could have been.|Fresh
The film's zombies-on-a-train premise delivers plenty of bloody violence and breathless action, punctuated by social commentary, strong characters and a heavy dose of melodrama.|Fresh
The train's compartmentalised space and succession of doors create both a fixed space rife with opportunities for tension and a welcome geographic certainty as infection spreads through the carriages.|Rotten
a view of flesh-eating Armageddon from the first class windows of a speeding train|Fresh
With this high-budget blockbuster, Yeon brings in a skilfull staging of sudden, irrepressible savagery of this unnatural disaster.|Fresh
Most memorable of this sad lot is not leading man Gong Yoo's cliched dapper businessman, but his scenestealing daughter, played by a fantastic Kim Soo An, 10, who never goes overboard even when she has to bawl in complete fear.|Fresh
It's a vicious and blood soaked zombie film with heart, humanity, and rich characterization.|Fresh
For seasoned fans of George Romero, let alone The Walking Dead, Train to Busan offers very few wrinkles in its elimination of zombies, but it remains mostly engrossing.|Fresh

Whatever your current stance on brain-eating, this is a keeper.|Fresh
What Train To Busan truly needs, and disappointingly lacks, is heart.|Rotten
The most purely entertaining zombie film in some time, finding echoes of George Romero's and Danny Boyle's work, but delivering something unique for an era in which kindness to others seems more essential than ever.|Fresh
"""Train to Busan"" is really a feast for the scary, gymnastic bit players: contorting their bodies, baring teeth and running full bore. On this express, they're a first-class menace indeed."|Fresh
Sprinting right out of the gate, the director, Yeon Sang-ho, dives gleefully into a sandbox of spilled brains and smug entitlement.|Fresh
Breathless and brutal, the film is akin to someone smashing together 28 Days Later with Snowpiercer and then convincing Mad Max's George Miller to help out on some of the action scenes.|Fresh
A big, effects-driven thriller with some very effective action sequences.|Fresh
Yeon Sang-ho's Train To Busan is the best fast-zombie picture since the Dawn Of The Dead remake. It's also an awful lot of fun.|Fresh

Well-executed tense zombie train ride thriller.|Fresh
Yeon Sang-ho has instantly transformed himself into Korea's go-to-guy for zombie movies.|Fresh
Train to Busan preaches that equality is the key to survival, but Yeon doesn't do the rest of us any favors by sacrificing the very things that make him special.|Rotten
When divorced of message-mongering, the film's scare tactics are among the most distinctive that the zombie canon has ever seen.|Fresh
Train To Busan is a viciously entertaining ride for the most part, but it's bookended with a needless introductory sequence and an extremely cheesy ending that borders on comical. Removal of these flaccid parts off would have made it a slicker journey.|Fresh
An entertaining ride, as well as providing political commentary when it overtly references the Korean government's response to the MERS virus alongside commenting on the country's class system.|Fresh
"""Train to Busan"" pulses with relentless locomotive momentum."|Fresh
