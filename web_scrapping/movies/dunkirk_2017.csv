Dunkirk is the masterwork Christopher Nolan's career has been building towards.|Fresh
Dunkirk may be short on words but it is not short on brilliance. And despite the tiny boats, big ships, darting planes, lumbering lorries and repeated identical queues, Nolan's spotlight shines on humanity in all its bravery and mundanity.|Fresh
This is one heck of a stunning war picture.|Fresh
"Christopher Nolan cements his directorial seal on the historical drama genre with ""Dunkirk,"" a sweeping World War II film unlike anything you've ever seen before."|Fresh
Dunkirk is a intense film with beautiful visuals, an equally beautiful score by Hans Zimmer and director in Christopher Nolan that is at the top of his game both narratively and visually.|Fresh
At its best, a visceral and immediate experience; unlike almost anything Nolan has done, is devoid of the operation of deciphering and understanding. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Nolan always makes films that engage the brain as much as any other faculty, and here, we see a film that is as visceral and experiential as anything he's ever done.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan has once again out-performed expectations to deliver a film which isn't just an experience, it is a work of art.|Fresh
Dunkirk is both the quietest and loudest of Christopher Nolan's films.|Fresh
Oblivious at best and propaganda at worst, Dunkirk is admittedly a sensory feast but one that leaves me concerned about its palpable nostalgia for an era before women's liberation and civil rights movements.|Rotten
This is a story that needed to be told in a way that only Christopher Nolan can bring, and his non-linear style only enhances my desire for multiple viewings.|Fresh
Dunkirk depicts World War II with barely an ounce of jingoism for maximum emotional effect.|Fresh
Nolan doesn't seem interested in dazzling us with mind bending ideas or twisty plots. Instead, he offers us a glimpse into the days and hours that the soldiers and civilians who were involved in the Battle of Dunkirk...|Fresh
Nolan's sole conceit is to create an industrial ode to the chaos of warfare, but I'd take Terrence Malick's anti-war ode, The Thin Red Line, over this, any day of the week.|Rotten
Dunkirk wants to go out of its way to avoid war movie cliches until it doesn't, at which point it embraces nearly all of them.|Rotten
Dunkirk is about heroism and the myriad forms that heroism can take.|Fresh
Coming at the tail end of a summer season that's been long on bombast and short on substance, Dunkirk is a welcome salve to franchise fatigue, and one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
I sincerely wish I'd liked it more.|Fresh
There's a method here more polished than in any of Nolan's previous work.|Fresh
unkirk represents Christopher Nolan working on a scale that matches his grandiose ambitions but doesn't fall into some of his weaker tendencies, such as loads and loads of expository dialogue and lengthy running times.|Fresh
With a minimal but very memorable score from Hans Zimmer pulsating throughout, Nolan has crafted a film that captures the brutality of battle and the fears of these people who were fighting for their survival -- as well as their respective countries.|Fresh
This is a near perfect movie. Nolan has a master's grasp on the material, showcasing it from start to finish.|Fresh
He's crafted a film that embraces its indifference to convention to express an abstract with resonate power and understanding.|Fresh
A historical miracle [that is] now also a marvel of both the genre and contemporary cinema.|Fresh
Nolan throws you face-first into the action in a way that war films of its ilk have never done before, and it's probably the first time my stomach repeatedly clenched without any blood or gore in sight.|Fresh
It's all about survival, and the lengths you will go to...it definitely gave me more on the second time around.|Fresh
I disagree with the sound design, which muddled up the dialogue...but, overall, still a great movie.|Fresh
"""Dunkirk"" is an amazingly crafted epic with masterful direction from Nolan and a perfect balance of both visual splendor and good ol' fashioned storytelling."|Fresh
Dunkirk ends on the burning remnants of Tom Hardy's Spitfire, an emblem of the fire of the human spirit that rages wherever injustice might try to put it out.|Fresh
Beautiful and intense from start to finish, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is not what you're expecting. It's more lyrical than linear, try to hold on too hard and analyze its terse dialogue and intimated plot, and it will slip right by you.|Fresh
Much of Dunkirk is unforgettable, a relentless ode to minor human victories in the face of colossal national disaster.|Fresh
Dunkirk's pacing is relentless which is why I am glad this is one of Nolan's shorter movies, it hits the sweet spot with its score, set-pieces and cinematography.|Fresh
... a fact-based disaster movie that, even if it didn't happen exactly this way, you can't help but feel for whomever endured it.|Fresh
Here, there are characters in the film, but the focus is on the event itself, not their individual stories. For doing away with such cliches, I praise the movie.|Fresh
"Unlike much of Christopher Nolan's oeuvre, ""Dunkirk"" is a fine successor to war films like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" yet it tries hard in places not to bore its audience."|Fresh
At a deeper level it is a testament to the audacious power of pure elemental filmmaking.|Fresh

Dunkirk comes in at a taut 106 minutes, and there isn't a wasted second.|Fresh
Dunkirk looked great, had some scenes of intensity that I enjoyed...but, in the end, the movie was slow, very ambitious but very unfocused.|Rotten
Movies need a script, first and foremost, and this one ... never quite comes together, though there is nevertheless a lot to admire in the attempt.|Fresh
It's not quite just a virtuoso exercise, though Nolan here proves himself a master of the technical effects he strives for and achieves.|Fresh
Nolan employs minimal dialogue and in media res camerawork to plunk the viewer right into the thick of things so you feel like you're experiencing the chaos of war and the reactive drive to escape it.|Fresh
A tribute to wartime resolve and directorial hubris; it's awe-inspiring in its logistics, scale and achievement.|Fresh
It is, for long stretches, almost a silent film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Dunkirk is a spectacularly timed exercise in film escapism, a warlike watch whose march is ominous and perfectly audible, even in the noise of a deafening battlefield. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
At home Dunkirk will not be a good movie. Right now, however, it's unmissable.|Fresh
... Nolan uses the Second World War and in particular the battle of Dunkirk and the eviction of the English army, to generate a series of images through which (and not historical events) can achieve a very different purpose. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Dunkirk may be a little shallow when it comes to its characters and narratives, but it more than makes up for it with a thrilling, visceral wartime experience that features stunning direction, gorgeous cinematography, and exceptional special effects.|Fresh
Here, the battle is appropriately tense, horrific and tragic, not without beauty - whether in the grateful gasp of a man saved from drowning, or Nolan's gorgeous shot of a miles-long beach at dawn on which flanks of desperate men are lined up.|Fresh
Any historical drama is necessarily a summary, and will approach a threshold at which distillation becomes dilution. Nolan doesn't seem too worried about this, and Dunkirk's eruptive brevity is almost refreshing.|Fresh
... both celebratory and somber.|Fresh
Artistically disjointed and historically unfactual, just the latest in a series of vastly overrated Christopher Nolan films.|Rotten
The visuals, the structure, the use of sound and music, and the simple presence of a beating heart - all come together in a whole that is truly breathtaking.|Fresh
Dunkirk is a series of survival sequences (occasionally with each one topping the last nerve-shredding dance with death) hammering home the old tried and true never surrender adage|Fresh
The most remarkable aspect might be that this is a war film that celebrates the simple act of surviving|Fresh
Dunkirk shows off Nolan's own techniques as a filmmaker to make for a film that is technically, if not completely narratively, lustrous.|Fresh
Dunkirk delivers a film that should give Christopher Nolan a long-overdue Oscar nomination for outstanding directing.|Fresh
With Dunkirk, Nolan has crafted a pulse-quickening, unrelenting 107 minute experience that grabs hold and refuses to let go until the credits roll.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's direction and Han Zimmer's music combine to make this war film an unforgettable cinematic experience.|Fresh
"Told as three separate stories (Land, Sea and Air) in three different time narratives (from a week out to a day to an hour before) ""Dunkirk"" is more of a thriller than a full out war film."|Fresh
The underlying critique of war and focus on survival and hope is what makes this film so great.|Fresh
If nothing else, it is yet another landmark achievement by one of the most important and skilled storytellers in the present generation of filmmaking.|Fresh
In every technical aspect, Dunkirk IS a marvel. The cinematography is great, the editing is sharp, Nolan's direction is detailed and precise, the sound is OUTSTANDING.|Fresh
The underlying story and its meticulous re-creation on the big screen completely won me over, as Nolan and his outstanding team deliver scene after scene of heroism, desperation, or that base human instinct for survival.|Fresh
"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Dunkirk"" seems to say that there are no heroes in war, only victims, suckers, survivors, and assholes. Perhaps Christopher Nolan's movie has a point after all. This movie sucks."|Rotten
The strange problem posed by the movie is, in terms of what it sets out to do, completely of a piece but missing the surge of feeling that would make that thing worth doing.|Rotten
It's a comma of compassion in a larger Sisyphean story of war, with Christopher Nolan's contemporaneously unrivaled visual instincts - wedding Storm Thorgerson's surreal photography to David Lean's cinematic majesty.|Fresh

Writer/director Christopher Nolan has a glorious gift.|Fresh

Nolan has made a movie full of fear and frenzy. It's impressive for sure.|Fresh
. . .I don't pretend to dismiss the undeniable grandeur of Dunkirk, or to diminish the cheers that the movie elicits when its soundtrack at last cues up the Elgar.|Fresh
For a film with a $150 million price tag, positioned as the biggest superhero-free Warner tentpole of 2017, it does just about as much experimenting as it could possibly dare.|Fresh
Dunkirk shows a world full of terror, but [Christopher] Nolan goes to great lengths to ensure that his audience is never terrified.|Rotten
Dunkirk stands high and proud as one of the finest films yet about World War 2. Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful, haunting, moving and memorable experience that, in a brilliant touch, turns out to be more immersive than explosive.|Fresh

A genuinely powerful and emotionally resonant glimpse into the fog of war, told viscerally and masterfully by a top-notch filmmaker in full command of his gifts. But Nolan indulges in a structural flourish that, for this viewer, simply doesn't play.|Fresh
Nolan aims to give an intimate look at what these men could feel and experience in a situation full of anguish and even despair and, if you look under that lens, Dunkirk far from being a failure, is a wise move. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An intense and oppressive experience always covered by the sound of a ticking clock that reminds us that there's no time to lose. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Nolan's Dunkirk is stripped-down almost to the point of abstraction, a story with little dialogue, focusing on a series of physical terrors - drowning, being struck from above or behind, all endured with tight-lipped masculine resolve.|Fresh
This movie took [a] piece of family lore and made it viscerally, undeniably real. I'm personally grateful for that.|Fresh
Loud, intense and almost disturbingly immersive, this is a showcase of true craftsmanship.|Fresh
Nolan delivers a war story filled with pulse-pounding thrills and emotionally powerful performances.|Fresh
Even with my reservations, I was glued to the screen and don't think I took a breath for the entire nearly two hours of running time.|Fresh
Nolan has created his most mature work in cinematographic language and humane situations, placing us on a barrel about to explode and closing the room with bolt on the outside. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With few action sequences, the film is intended to portray a feeling, not to present endearing characters, resulting in a very interesting exercise. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

'Dunkirk' shows the grit and realism of war in a finely wrought film.|Fresh
It is a film with little blood and heavy stress and fatigue, easy on combat and heavy on tragedy, as Nolan's obsession with time is made elastic to reflect the perspectives of the soldiers on water, ground, and air.|Fresh
A film like we rarely see in the movies, and that will certainly take several awards in the upcoming Oscars. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Elegance of nightmare, essence of terror. We are catapulted to war, in three interleaving but sometimes indistinct timeframes: a week, a day, an hour. Time collapses. There is the presence of fright, the adrenalized now.|Fresh

104 minutes of innovation; a war movie like no other. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Dunkirk makes a fairly standard ""war is hell"" statement. It just appears to say more because Nolan went all William S. Burroughs and played cut-up with his script."|Rotten
Nolan has made a career of fiercely inventive filmmaking. But this might be his masterpiece: a relatively simple story told with creative verve, relentlessly growing intensity, emotional resonance and the weight of history.|Fresh
Dunkirk sees Christopher Nolan really coming of age as a director. It's his masterpiece at last and it's destined to become regarded as a very important film indeed.|Fresh
It's not always easy to know what's going on in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk-which makes the film seem all the more convincing as an evocation of war.|Fresh
It's high on noise, chaos, and anxiety, and low on visual poetry. [But] it provides a necessary corrective to the dangerous machismo of most war films.|Fresh

The bits of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk that are good are so good. The bits of it that are bad are just awful.|Rotten
Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk delivers a work of art to the playing field of the summer blockbuster.|Fresh
This is an account of a neglected chapter of history that does justice to its scope, thanks to Nolan's assiduous application of his craft.|Fresh
The effects are less realistic than they are thrilling and entrancing, a set of sensory adventures alluding to World War II movie tropes... But the movie also turns these tropes inside out to articulate a broader theme.|Fresh
Reserved, dignified, proud and brave, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is nothing if not very, very British.|Fresh
scaling the geography of his vast and complex battle narrative, [Nolan] weaves an exciting, contemplative and lasting image of warfare told from the quiet fringes of thebattlefield to its fiery epicenter.|Fresh
Other than bits of Memento and those great Joker scenes in The Dark Knight, this may be [Nolan's] finest hour (and forty-six minutes).|Fresh
"""Virtual reality without the headset"", [Nolan] calls it, and it's no idle boast. Everything has been meticulously -- and effectively -- designed to dissolve the barrier between you and the screen."|Fresh
Christopher Nolan eschews Batmanesque grandiosity, not to mention irony and blatant special effects, to pursue a more authentically immersive view of this historical turning point.|Fresh
Call it a victory on all fronts.|Fresh
It takes a confident, accomplished filmmaker to make a war film like this, epic, understated, nearly bereft of dialog, no off screen narration, a huge story brought down to intimate levels. It reminds me of some Stanley Kubrick movies.|Fresh
A master class by Nolan in all areas of cinema. A relentless and captivating cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
All these frantic bits and pieces come together under Nolan's narrative scheme to form a stirring panorama.|Fresh
Soldier and civilian alike are left powerless in the face of a seemingly hidden enemy who can come from anywhere at any time.|Fresh

Nolan seems somewhat uninterested in the humans standing amid his spectacular effects.|Rotten
Nolan has revitalised his approach to filmmaking, and the results are nothing less than awe inspiring.|Fresh
Dunkirk does World War II like nothing you've ever seen.|Fresh
The most stunning movie of 2017.|Fresh
Hard to categorize Dunkirk. Grand piece of art? Virtuoso nail-bite fest? It's both. While decidedly nerve-wracking, you'll be glad you went and suffered with the soldiers who saved us from Hitler.|Fresh
"Marks Christopher Nolan's final transition from being the ""twisty plot guy"" to the ""awe-inspiring visuals guy."" A welcome change."|Fresh
An immersive movie that takes viewers inside the experience of war on sea, on the land, and in the air.|Fresh
It's a curious mix of old fashioned mawkishness, dewy eyed, if understated, patriotism, and contemporary art house narratological experimentation. It is, appropriately, very British (as we like to think of ourselves).|Fresh
A contemporary war movie that echoes classic combat films but eclipses them at the same time, Nolan's new epic puts Dunkirk on the cinematic map.|Fresh
I appreciated and liked a lot of what Nolan accomplished, but it was too impersonal and distant to fully love.|Fresh
Ambitious, emotional, impressive, beautiful, terrifying and superbly cast, it's a fitting testimony to one of the most remarkable episodes in modern warfare.|Fresh
Heroism is celebrated, Spitfires fly, Churchill is reverently quoted and we're offered scenes of plucky British pathos that could have been written in the 1940s.|Fresh
It is hard to imagine a better tribute to this victory of survival than Nolan's spare, stunning, extraordinarily ambitious film.|Fresh
Dunkirk is a war movie that plays particularly well for people who don't typically like war movies.|Fresh
A little carnage goes a long way when it's punctuated with sweeping money shots of thousands of soldiers on an expansive, haunted beach. You don't experience the misery in the misery-you feel it in the spaces in between.|Fresh
Nolan uses unusual and new techniques to make the viewer feel as if she/he is actually experiencing the action--for better or worse. This is one of the great WWII films.|Fresh
This astonishing film demands to be watched on the biggest screen available.|Fresh
Dunkirk brings a lump to the throat and a tear to the eye. Highly recommended.|Fresh
A film that will doubtless become the definitive cinematic depiction of this remarkable chapter of history.|Fresh
Nolan has given us the cinematic equivalent of the British stiff upper lip.|Fresh
It's the anti-blockbuster blockbuster, full of brains, grit and a fearlessness to challenge superhero-drunk filmgoers to invest fully of themselves by finding meaning in every exquisitely shot frame.|Fresh
Dunkirk is being hailed in some quarters as one of the greatest war films ever made and in others as a typically overrated Christopher Nolan endeavor. Neither claim is accurate, although the enthusiasts are closer to the mark than the Nolan naysayers.|Fresh
"Impressive ""Dunkirk"" Hampered by Gimmick."|Fresh
Spinoza once opined that you couldn't use words to describe God, because by choosing any one or several, you would be eliminating the infinite nature of the deity. That essential inadequacy of words drives much of Nolan's stunning film.|Fresh
From the start, Nolan gives the action a terrifying immediacy, pummelling us with the intensity of his images and the throbbing power of Hans Zimmer's score.|Fresh
...instantly enters the pantheon of great modern war films... that don't glorify war, but respect and honor those who have had to endure it.|Fresh
Allows us to feel as much as possible how the soldiers must have felt during that trying evacuation, where death was all-around them at the beach.|Fresh
Technically awe-inspiring, narratively inventive and thematically complex, Dunkirk reinvigorates its genre with a war movie that is both harrowing and smart.|Fresh
It's an extraordinary undertaking, and Nolan delivers a spellbinding ride. Out of the depths or man-made horror, he's created a gripping tale of human resolve.|Fresh
Despite all the substandard characterization, what we do see sucks us in enough to keep us invested and, at times, riveted.|Fresh
"Watching ""Dunkirk"" for the first time takes me back to my first viewing of ""The Thin Red Line;"" I'm ready for its mastery to emerge in repeat viewings..."|Fresh
Land, sea and air, all disturbed by war and freckled with humanity, merge splendidly in another near-masterpiece from writer/director Christopher Nolan.|Fresh
Surely the filmmaker's insistence upon imposing his favourite device upon all his narratives is edging towards Shyamalan-like overkill.|Rotten
Nolan deserves to be commended for his superior craftsmanship. Ultimately, however, Dunkirk falls way short of such contemporary genre classics as The Big Red One, The Thin Red Line or Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.|Fresh
Deploying his mastery over filmmaking technology, Nolan has made World War II look fresh and exciting by focusing not on the action sequences as much as the desperate struggle for survival.|Fresh
Mr. Nolan can be forgiven, or even praised, for refusing to pander to sentiment. He's given filmgoers far more to see and hear -- and Dunkirk will be heard from at Oscar time.|Fresh
Nolan has crafted not just his own best film but one of the finest war films of the 21st century.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's biggest departure yet is successful in showing the horrors of war without relying on action-heavy expectancies.|Fresh
This is real cinema: spare, terse, expertly edited. I saw it in 70mm, and so should you if you can. But mostly, you should just go see it -- it's a masterpiece.|Fresh
Ambitious, sophisticated and gloriously cinematic, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk bursts into the heart of the summer moviegoing season.|Fresh
Dunkirk is a powerful work from one of the great directors of our time.|Fresh
Despite the curtailed run time, as chaotic as it may seem, it still bears the director's meticulous attention to detail and technical mastery, which pays off over and over in many suitably distressing ways|Fresh
This is a magnificent achievement accomplished with staggering buoyancy and grace, the victory of survival its own form of heroism worthy of celebration.|Fresh
[N]early two hours of uninspiring mayhem...Dunkirk uses history as a pretext to show off the director's fascination for calamity.|Rotten
Director Christopher Nolan delivers one of this summer's most precisely crafted, visually astonishing films in the simultaneously gorgeous and devastating Dunkirk.|Fresh
All [the actors] succeed, but special mention goes to Whitehead's Tommy, whose mixture of fear and determination in the opening scene sets the movie's tone, and Rylance, whose civilian skipper suggests quiet dignity like no other.|Fresh
Dunkirk's relatively brief running time, though, means there's rarely a dull moment. Viewers are thrust into the action, and like many of the soldiers, they're left on their own to sink or swim.|Fresh
Each setting features its own editing rhythm, characters and score... Far from being a Memento-like puzzle to piece together, Dunkirk is a series of tense standoffs whose resolutions all funnel into the same prerequisite; get the soldiers home.|Fresh
Brings a refreshing unconventionality to the war movie genre.|Fresh
Dunkirk's plot is fairly uncomplicated. The thrill is in the deeply exhilarating pace at which the action unfolds.|Fresh
It is a good movie. One bordering on great, even. The best movie Christopher Nolan's done in years... and I say that as someone who likes (most, sorry The Dark Knight Rises) Nolan movies.|Fresh
It is Nolan's control of the visuals that makes this among the most harrowing of war films.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's genius for treating movies like chess matches... is brilliantly employed in this account of the British (and French) attempt to retreat across the English Channel from the coastal city of Dunkirk in the early years of World War II.|Fresh
On top of the non-stop action, Nolan succeeds by acknowledging weak spots that have plagued his entire career. Instead of improving on these weaknesses, he crafted a film that has no need for them.|Fresh
Nolan makes up a triptych with war's relativity -- time stretching or standing still in the presence of death.|Fresh
Anyone hoping to be guided through all this morass of detonations and drownings by the handrail of dialogue, the nuance and shade of human drama, will have to go whistle. Dunkirk is not about characters but character.|Fresh
In absence of his usual brand of intellectual complexity, Nolan instead packs each of his uncharacteristically minimalistic tales with a career-best effort in emotional fortuity.|Fresh
It's a harrowing, moving, and minimalist epic that haunts the soul while satisfying those fleshy urges with spectacular and unforgettable action alongside an unrelenting hum of anxious intensity. It's about people, not war.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan steps in a new direction this time, delivering a picture that engages the intellect and the senses, if not exactly the heart.|Fresh
Dunkirk becomes much more than a war film. It can be classified within the war genre but it's more of a personal affair rather than a two-hour shootout on battlefields.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is a stunning technical accomplishment -- like all of writer/producer/director Nolan's films, I suppose -- and also the leanest, sharpest thing he's made since Memento.|Fresh
Dunkirk manages to be a stirring , yet intimate epic all at the same time. At its core though it is a gripping thriller that is unlike anything I have ever seen in this genre, a bravura triumph for Christopher Nolan.|Fresh
Dunkirk is very, very good- but it's not transcendent|Fresh
It's a series of riveting tableaux, but the human center is lacking.|Fresh
Its flaws may keep it from reaching the highest levels of Nolan's directorial catalog, but as a portrait of a pivotal moment in world history, Dunkirk is the kind of gripping and powerful experience that Imax screens were made for.|Fresh

Nolan's array of unique POV shots and his peerless command of scale relay the terrifying subjective experiences of Dunkirk's characters in a hauntingly visceral way.|Fresh
Exhilaratingly claustrophobic, Christopher Nolan's latest is the best film of the year thus far.|Fresh
Yet, for all the heroic effort, there is no heroic result.... Dunkirk pulls itself apart on the beaches, in the air, and on the seas. It never surrenders a single strand of storyline so the others may survive.|Rotten
...[Dunkirk delivers] film-going experience that is more visceral than intellectual or emotional.|Fresh
"""Dunkirk"" is a faithful and well-crafted retelling of an overlooked, but crucial, event in World War II, which is enough to make it worth your time."|Fresh
A World War II movie your dad will fall asleep watching on the couch.|Rotten
Communicates the dislocations of war in a powerful new way, and will likely be mumbled over by film-school scholars for years to come. How many non-scholars will be wanting to see it a second time we will soon discover.|Fresh
"The brilliant, unconventional structure adds to the immersive nature of ""Dunkirk,"" reinforcing the sense that the war is everywhere, that characters who haven't even met make decisions with life-or-death consequences for each other."|Fresh
Relentlessly barreling between dive bombings, torpedo attacks and dogfights, the movie works your nerves. It's just one damn thing after another.|Fresh
Easily an early Oscar contender in various categories, including Best Picture. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Nolan's WWII epic is unlike anything you've seen on screen before. So why are we so disengaged?|Fresh
Extremely ambitious yet rarely effective...|Rotten
Dunkirk left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied, with too many unanswered questions. For me it missed the big picture. If that means I'm swimming against the tide, so be it.|Rotten
Important to the film's success is Hans Zimmer's unique score, which becomes a living entity unto itself due to pulsating sounds.|Fresh
A beautifully shot, shallow, and nauseating video game. Too much Spectacle and not nearly enough humanism, a truly special effect that money cannot buy. It's the equivalent of dry, stale bread.|Rotten
Other critics are raving about this one. Did we see a different movie? This one is terribly disjointed and you are never connected to the characters. Wanted to like it but...|Rotten
Absolutely Stunning|Fresh
A vivid symphony of visceral experiences.|Fresh
With an interwoven script that intersects when you least expect it, the film is a mighty example of storytelling and the power of atmosphere.|Fresh
Although Dunkirk looks at one of the most amazing military/civil operations of World War II (or maybe of any military conflict in history), it's not a war movie. It's Christopher Nolan's view of a war movie.|Fresh
Nolan again continues his proud tradition of eschewing computer-generated shots in favour of actual ships, planes and men. The result is a film that will look authentic, bloody, honest and real for as long there are people to watch it.|Fresh
Dunkirk isn't striving to immortalise English heroism as a sepia-toned portrait. Dunkirk simply wants to transport you to the battlefield, and experience the horrors that lie there.|Fresh
It is brave, and even admirable, but if you are fond of an emotional core? Then you will sorely feel the lack of it.|Rotten
The miracle of Dunkirk is that it's different from other war movies in the best ways, and it's exceptional in every technical sense, making it one of the most emotionally powerful films of 2017.|Fresh
"As both a fresh approach to historical action and a thunderous throwback to old-fashioned war movies, Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" is a triumphant feat of white-knuckle storytelling."|Fresh
The picture is distinguished by a knack for undercutting genre conventions without diminishing them emotionally.|Fresh
Dunkirk is Nolan's most directly cinematic of his works, knocking plot and melodrama down the totem pole in favor of furiously transportive images and sounds that elicit emotion in a more primal, instinctual way.|Fresh
Arguably Nolan's best film, Dunkirk is a propulsive descent into Hell that celebrates the indomitable human spirit.|Fresh
A vivid, heart-pounding, emotional rollercoaster of a film, Dunkirk is also one of the most immersive experiences you could ever wish to endure. But therein lies its genius.|Fresh
Ultimately, this is an unsentimentally masterful chronicle of a propaganda victory plucked from the jaws of military disaster.|Fresh
The film is a wonder to experience (especially in Imax), but it's not perfect. For all the technical brilliance, there's something emotionally removed about the storytelling that keeps a viewer at arm's length throughout.|Fresh
The pleasure in the storytelling arc is how elements move swiftly together. Nolan's biggest trick is the film starts out being epic and moves effortlessly to the intimate ....|Fresh
What it is, essentially, is 106 clamorous minutes of big-screen bombast that's so concerned with its own spectacle and scale that it neglects to deliver the most crucial element -- drama.|Rotten
His exciting set pieces of sinking ships and aerial dogfights will thrill audiences who head to big Hollywood films for spectacle. But when Nolan gets the subtler moments right, you see something much more.|Fresh
So many of us wanted Dunkirk to be truly great. It's too virtuous and not vulgar enough to be great. It's a brilliant film that embraces grandeur but has a tasteful horror of rhetoric.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's first non-fantasy movie is bold, visceral, and powerful, with many moving sequences -- though some of his filmmaking choices can be challenging.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan affirms his status as contemporary cinema's boldest blockbuster director with this intensely immersive and relentlessly stirring chronicle of the famous World War II evacuation.|Fresh
Given little context and even less character arc, Dunkirk emerges as an emotionally hollow exercise in wartime spectacle.|Rotten
Not a second is wasted in the taut 105-minute running time, something Nolan emphasizes by giving it the ticking-clock structure of a thriller, albeit a very Nolan-style thriller.|Fresh
From the get-go Dunkirk is a relentlessly tense affair...|Fresh
"The tension starts from minute one and doesn't let up until the credits roll in ""Dunkirk,"" Christopher Nolan's terse, nerve-jangling WWII drama."|Fresh
It's a gripping addition to the canon of war on film that is definitely worthy of attention, and some of the images are electrifying.|Fresh
There's so much to absorb and appreciate in this movie that one viewing just might not be enough.|Fresh
Is it ethical to make a war movie this beautiful?|Fresh
Both intimate and epic, as emotional as it is tension-filled, it is being ballyhooed as a departure for bravura filmmaker Christopher Nolan, but in truth the reason it succeeds so masterfully is that it is anything but.|Fresh
It only takes a matter of minutes for Dunkirk to convey the unmistakeable notion you are in the presence of true cinematic greatness. This is what a masterpiece looks like. Sounds like. Feels like.|Fresh
Nolan's simplest and at the same time most complex narrative film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Dunkirk"" bolts out the gate not like a thoroughbred racehorse, but like a pack of them, never stopping until - thunderingly, and with a feeling that encompasses both victory and defeat - it crosses the finish line."|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is not so much a war story as it is an attempt to communicate the experience of war.|Fresh
When the structure of Dunkirk becomes visible, when it stands as a mathematical demonstration of brave individual choices lining up in a tidy row, you might realize that you've been had.|Rotten
As an examination of collective triumph and spirit it is a decisive victory.|Fresh
"""Dunkirk"" is a finely crafted examination of a historical event that changed the direction of the war."|Fresh
As magnificently well crafted as Dunkirk is, it is a film destined to be respected more than it is loved, and given Nolan's record -- I credit him with five great movies -- I call this a highly honorable achievement that nonetheless slightly disappoints.|Fresh
An intense, carefully calibrated mini-epic about surviving war.... Packs the punch of something far more graphic.|Fresh
This is a grand spectacle, not an empty one, a rare example of the Hollywood blockbuster dollar well spent.|Fresh
See it on the biggest screen you can find.|Fresh
A cinematic triumph that will awe some viewers and alienate others - for the same basic reasons.|Fresh
"Seldom has a film so eloquently captured the craziness, brutality and arbitrariness of war. ""Dunkirk"" just might be Nolan's masterpiece."|Fresh
As a big-screen experience this can be overwhelming, especially when characters are trapped below oncoming planes or inside beleaguered sea vessels; few war movies have communicated more viscerally how it feels to be a sitting duck.|Fresh
Director/writer Christopher Nolan masterfully revives the classic war film with an edge-of-your-seat, emotionally-charged thriller.|Fresh
Whenever it creates or recreates the bigger picture, Dunkirk itself becomes a bigger, bolder, better picture.|Fresh
A streak of honest sentiment, earned under the most hellish of circumstances, courses through this movie and provides it with spine and a soul.|Fresh
The first film Nolan has made that feels bigger than the director's preoccupations and obsessions.|Fresh
An inspirational tribute to Britain's Greatest Generation that just might be Chris Nolan's best picture yet!|Fresh
With magnificent visuals, tension is the star.|Fresh
Its images are most obviously big in size, more importantly fluid in movement in a way not equaled (let alone attempted) by just about anything you might find anywhere.|Fresh
In a time when prestige TV is hogging lots of attention (and deservedly so!), Christopher Nolan's stunning WWII saga makes a pretty strong case for the continued sustenance of film.|Fresh
Nolan has made a war movie that provokes both thrills and thought. Consider Dunkirk another must-see.|Fresh
Nolan has delivered a visceral, suspenseful, at times jaw-dropping historical war movie, the lone disclaimer being that he sacrifices character development in his steadfast focus on technical virtuosity.|Fresh
World War II history buffs won't want to miss this large, sprawling colossus of a film.|Fresh
It's beautifully shot, with a panoramic depth and breadth of landscapes. It is also unrelenting.|Fresh
Dunkirk will bowl you over. It is almost too much power for one filmmaker to have.|Fresh
The most emotional moments in Nolan's film are the smaller ones, a soldier slipping into the sea swimming towards home, a young hero recognized in a local newspaper.|Fresh
A display of both Nolan's dark, wizard-like powers as a filmmaker and his weaknesses and neurotic affectations as a storyteller.|Fresh
"Watching Dunkirk, the word ""masterpiece"" comes to mind -- often and effortlessly."|Fresh
"The finest war movies examine the personal struggles within the larger framework of a battle: the eye-level conflict. That's the strategy of ""Dunkirk,"" an ambitious, evocative (but at times too aloof) World War II epic."|Fresh
I'd go so far to say that Dunkirk could easily serve as its own master class in the art of film editing. Add to that an absolutely terrifyingly discordant score from Hans Zimmer and the result is, well, a bona fide classic. Well done, sir, well done.|Fresh
[Dunkirk] captures this struggle for survival with visceral intensity. It offers an immersion into this harrowing moment that is vast in its ambition and comprehensive in the degree to which it fulfills it.|Fresh
"Wisely, Nolan's movie is not about the ""big picture."" At about 106 minutes, it's a fast-paced, rousing story of soldiers and civilians confronting overwhelming odds, their moral compasses, fear and the specter of death."|Fresh
"""Dunkirk"" is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's."|Fresh
"This blockbuster spectacle is an intense experience of pure cinema that far exceeds the standard ""miracle at Dunkirk"" narrative."|Fresh
Nolan is challenging himself to try and tell a war story in a different way.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's ghostly and taut war story is his best film in years.|Fresh
From the first frame to the last, it's a propulsive ride that wrings so much tension out of the audience that by the time the credits roll, there's little you can do but stare at the screen in stunned silence.|Fresh
Nolan's film could only have been made by a cinema master with the perspective of time and all the history since, and we are fortunate to be here when he did.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's recent output has been a master class of technical precision, as if that alone were enough. It's not, by the way.|Fresh
"At a relatively short running time for an ""epic"", the characters are not developed enough to allow us to care about their survival."|Rotten
"No doubt that ""Dunkirk"" is technologically well conceived and crafted. Unfortunately, a clever idea and expert editing cannot compensate for a dearth of human emotions."|Rotten
Nolan's made an intimidating endeavor, but those hoping for an exhaustively emotional event should seek their wartime blues elsewhere.|Fresh
In his ever-growing oeuvre, Dunkirk ranks as one of Christopher Nolan's best.|Fresh
Dunkirk, a film about men, created by men, is a force of nature - an elemental beast of a movie about finding the meaning of life surrounded by the meaninglessness of war.|Fresh
Dunkirk is a return to true form for director Christopher Nolan and it may very well be his best film yet. It combines the clever structure of Memento, the scale and ambition of The Dark Knight and the incredible cinematography of Inception.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan remains an abstract artist at core, and the tricky structure of his spectacular Dunkirk is not far removed from the games played in his science-fiction blockbusters Inception and Interstellar.|Fresh
A disappointment, a visual marvel but one lacking in emotional resonance, the sort of film one respects for its craftsmanship-but feels distanced from.|Rotten
Nolan challenges everything you might expect from the subject matter: be it in terms of narrative, plot structure, or even the basic notions placed on war films in general, and World War II movies in the main.|Fresh
It isn't a masterpiece or the best film from Christopher Nolan, but it's quite impressive. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I wanted to walk out of Dunkirk with my heart beating. And I walked out with my brain humming.|Fresh
Primal and exhilarating, full of dread and tension. Drops us right into the chaos of war to tell an intimate story about fear and intensity of purpose.|Fresh
The star of the show is cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, whose serene photography provides a necessary counterbalance to the breathless editing.|Fresh
...there are maybe ten minutes in the middle where I felt my attention waning-and yet I'd hate to discourage Nolan from trying to take this approach more often.|Fresh
DUNKIRK's triumph owes to the simplicity of the finished product, not the complexity of the technical inputs. That masterful distillation is the piece that Nolan has finally brought under his command.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan has created something new in the annals of war films - an intimate epic.|Fresh
[Nolan] has managed to combine the epic and the intimate. We are a long way from next year's Oscars but Dunkirk must surely already be a frontrunner.|Fresh
What Nolan gets right in Dunkirk -- from the action to the spare dialogue -- is so good that it makes the fact that any narrative deficiencies exist seem all the more disappointing.|Fresh
An immersive, bombastic historical epic more interested in how things happen than the people who things actually happen to.|Fresh
This is a movie that deserves to be seen on the largest screen possible and, no, whatever you have in your home doesn't count unless you reside inside an IMAX theater.|Fresh

Rigorously staged and artfully photographed...Christopher Nolan applies his trademark ingenuity and clockwork precision to an otherwise straightforward story.|Fresh
Dunkirk makes for Christopher Nolan's most intense and nerve-wracking thriller yet, delivering a strikingly terse viewing experience in the process.|Fresh
It's at once minimalist and maximalist, cynical and dopey, a big-boy white elephant art film that is actually a lean and mean suspense set-piece machine.|Fresh
In a swift 106 minutes, watching Dunkirk becomes a stunning and genuine experience, enveloping viewers in a way few movies ever do.|Fresh
Thanks to Nolan's unapologetically immense and imposing style, Dunkirk is as cinematically close as one can get to wartime trauma, survival impulses, and heroic altruism.|Fresh
"""Dunkirk"" is one of the great war pictures of our time. It's haunting, it's rapturous, and it's unforgettable."|Fresh
It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers.|Fresh

A bold, intentionally bloodless film that for the most part works spectacularly well.|Fresh

This accomplished, exceptional piece of cinema delivers summer-scale spectacle, albeit without the escapism audiences often crave from blockbuster releases at this time of the year.|Fresh
For all its taut direction and editing, its thunderous sound and its historic origins, the film doesn't quite move us as deeply and as often as we expect. Perhaps Nolan is trying too hard to construct the mood with the tools at his command.|Fresh
Nolan is the star of this explosive mood piece that soars on the wings of its visuals and sound and makes it truly a visceral experience.|Fresh
Being as objective as it is may ultimately rob the film of some of its potential for emotional impact, but there is no denying Dunkirk is unlike any war film we've ever seen.|Fresh
Dunkirk is a great last half of a movie, but alone is an emotionless vacuum.|Rotten
The film's fussy ambition ultimately results in aesthetic and thematic sloppiness.|Rotten
"""Dunkirk"" is a great movie, both an old-time inspirational war epic and at the same time very much a Christopher Nolan movie."|Fresh
You disappear inside of it and it changes you, as all great movies do.|Fresh
Human nature is on full display, for better, for worse, or both. The man who commits a selfish act in order to survive and the man who acts gallantly to save others may, in fact, be the same man.|Fresh

Christopher Nolan's epic isn't just the best film of his career, but one of the best war movies in decades.|Fresh
Even as we are left exhausted and stunned by what we've watched, there is an underlying lack of emotional connection that leaves the film as chilly as Nolan's detractors have accused his other pictures of being.|Fresh
Sensational in every sense of the word; it aims for both the heart and the head, to be sure, but arrives there via the central nervous system.|Fresh
For his next, and possibly greatest trick, Nolan has whipped up a war movie fearful of and resistant to combat itself, instead preoccupied with the rough interplay between duty and fear.|Fresh
Dunkirk wants us to sense what made this moment so pivotal without reducing it to an individual tale. And at that, it succeeds richly.|Fresh
Christopher Nolan's relentlessly tense historical epic Dunkirk is a war movie like no other, a gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller than doesn't give you a moment to catch your breath.|Fresh
