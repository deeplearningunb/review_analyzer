Spielberg works well with children, but never before has he directed them with such reticence or such appreciation of their humor, intelligence and decency.|Fresh
It lifts you into its make-believe in the wonderfully enriching way that only movies can do. I wouldn't be surprised if 'E.T.' eventually turned into the kind of durable classic that can be revived indefinitely for future generations.|Fresh
It's connection, its life, and it's about feelings of love that tends to transcend species and stars.|Fresh
With a touching relationship at the core of its compelling narrative, along with a brilliant score and nostalgic special effects, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial remains one of director Steven Spielberg's most beloved films.|Fresh
It's a fantastical adventure with a grounding in the modern (circa 1982) world of suburbia, divorce, and adolescent anxiety, and E.T. is the ultimate imaginary playmate come to life.|Fresh
What makes the movie a masterpiece is the intensely visceral way in which Spielberg conveys these children feeling adult emotions for the first time.|Fresh
Without a doubt, I can say this is a masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Spielberg would seem to be groping towards a virtual theology of space, space as Heaven, offering solace to a world which has foolishly renounced its traditional God but still aches to extend its own spiritual frontiers.|Fresh
What's perhaps most amazing about E.T., what distinguishes it from many of the other fantasy films of its era, is its ability to put an audience under a spell of childlike wonderment without infantilizing it.|Fresh
Spielberg's direction and Melissa Mathison's script never lose sight of the realistic, low center of gravity world of childhood, in which such marvelous adventures happen every day.|Fresh

Spielberg's direction and Melissa Mathison's script never lose sight of the realistic, low center of gravity world of childhood, in which such marvelous adventures happen every day.|Fresh
It holds up beautifully.|Fresh
There are many big moments in E.T., but also plenty of magical small ones that make it work after all these years.|Fresh
My heart still soars as Elliott goes airborne and pedals across the face of an impossibly full harvest moon on his bike.|Fresh
The movie is emotionally tumultuous and evenhanded and serene.|Fresh
It is a hugely enjoyable romp, but compellingly spiked throughout with little stabs of anxiety.|Fresh
Time has done little to diminish the power of E.T.'s signature moments.|Fresh
The film is full of funny scenes and magical moments.|Fresh
Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible.|Fresh
E.T. remains Spielberg's finest demonstration of his ability to merge the feelings of suburban dissatisfaction - alienation, if you will - that permeates a lot of his work, with a unique sense of childhood wonder and imagination|Fresh
It is the kind of film that young people are going to want to see again immediately after they've seen it.|Fresh
This is a special, delightful adventure, in which Spielberg manages not only to entertain young children but also reach out to the child in all of us.|Fresh
You're still gonna need those tissues.|Fresh
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial still evokes laughter, tears and that heart-lifting surge of joy only a great movie can bring.|Fresh
Unchecked goodness has its price, after all, and childhood wonder wouldn't be nearly as sweet if it didn't fade. That may explain the film's appeal. It trapped that feeling, and its sense of possibility, in amber -- then, now, and for any time.|Fresh
among all that corniness, there's a great little movie|Fresh
Rosie Grier let kids know that it's all right to cry. E.T. gave kids, adults, and aliens no choice in the matter.|Fresh
Rosie Grier let kids know that it's all right to cry. E.T. gave kids, adults, and aliens no choice in the matter.|Fresh
...a celebration of kid culture from a time when fun meant riding your bike and playing D&D with your friends.|Fresh
It makes us believe in magic again even as grizzled, cynical adults.|Fresh
One of Spielberg's two or three masterpieces, an extremely satisfying sci-fi fable.|Fresh
Steven Spielberg at his most pure.|Fresh
An appealing film this new one is, with some charm, some glee in the childrens' triumphs, some share in their friendship with E.T.|Fresh
Spielberg's family classic is still one of the best.|Fresh
Spielberg triumphantly succeeds in bringing the magical to the everyday.|Fresh
More than the work of any other filmmaker, Spielberg's output seems uniquely designed to induce in me this queasy false-memory syndrome.|Rotten
On inherent merit, the movie would not warrant such a highly publicized re-release, but this is one of those films that transcends what's on the screen.|Fresh
A contemporary classic.|Fresh
It helped alter the course of sci-fi movies by suggesting that intergalactic aliens might not be monsters but friendly, even loving, creatures. This doesn't make it a masterpiece, but it's fun.|Fresh
Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible.|Fresh
What I see is simply a timeless story about friendship, loss and maturity -- and, perhaps, an idealized America of the kind Hollywood and politicians strive to convince us could really exist.|Fresh
...a bona fide classic that has something to offer moviegoers of all ages.|Fresh
The 20th anniversary of Spielberg's magical picture, which many considered to be one of his very best, contains many special featurettes|Fresh
Although conclusively demonstrating Spielberg's preeminence as the popular artist of his time, E.T. finally seems a less impressive film than Close Encounters.|Fresh
E.T. is a film I will continue to watch over and over for the rest of my life. It is one I will never grow sick of, no matter how many times I watch it.|Fresh
It's a simple beautiful story about loneliness, friendship, and the bittersweet pangs of childhood.|Fresh
What do Ernest Hemingway, Carl Sandburg, Albert Einstein, and E.T. have in common? The eyes, according to Spielberg.|Fresh
|Fresh
Steven Spielberg's E.T. The Extraterrestrial touches the heart, engages the senses, and playfully challenges us to cavort with its allusive meanings.|Fresh
What E.T. does so well is to capture that moment in life when childhood seems to be slipping away.|Fresh
The OOOOOs and Ahhhhhhhhs are contagious, the cheering as Elliot, Michael and their friends take to the air as they're being chased by the Feds will still raise a cheer.|Fresh
Now that's entertainment.|Fresh
The simple truth is, no other movie has the same power to unite audiences in wonder and fulfilment.|Fresh
Come 2022, I'm sure I'll be seeing it again with my kids.|Fresh
E.T. isn't my favorite movie; it's not even my favorite Spielberg movie, but no one can deny the powerful effect it had on the film industry, our attitude toward extraterrestrial life, and our culture.|Fresh
The film remains pure cinematic enchantment in every sense of the word.|Fresh
I doubt if the public that fell so much in love with this cute Disney-like tale had looked too deeply at this religious parable and examined how overwrought and crude it really is.|Rotten
Universal has taken its task seriously and the result is a complete and entertaining package.|Fresh
The story itself holds up fairly well though, twenty years later, does come off as thinner than I recalled.|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
Most importantly of all things, the ORIGINAL unaltered, unblemished, and gloriously widescreen 1982 version is included, so all complaints are tempered with a sense of overall satisfaction.|Fresh
[It] may become a children's classic of the space age.|Fresh
One of the great children's movies of all time has lost none of its charm in this 20th anniversary re-release.|Fresh
It remains a timeless classic: it blew my mind when I saw it as a kid, and watching it again 20 years later, I still adored it.|Fresh
One of the most popular movies ever made.|Fresh
An uplifting tale appealing to child inside us all.|Fresh
This is Spielberg's masterpiece, a near perfect film directed with astonishing skill and unafraid to get sentimental ... without crossing the line into syrup.|Fresh
|Fresh
Definitely worth seeing in the theater whether you've seen it before or not.|Fresh
A film that connects so beautifully to our sense of wonder and joy.|Fresh
An astonishingly warm and enjoyable family film full of genuine sweetness and heart.|Fresh
For the most part, however, Spielberg and Mathison have their priorities straight.|Fresh
To dismiss an artist the caliber of Spielberg solely on the accusation of treacly sentimentalism is to dismiss the great American poets of our history.|Fresh
When a movie has stuck around for this long, you know there's something there. It's that good.|Fresh
Like Peter Pan, who also took children flying until it was time for them to grow up, E.T. represents the wonder of childhood, of a time that we must all leave behind.|Fresh
The newly enhanced effects cannot affect what's most important to the film. Its heart is still there, completely intact, and that's really all that matters.|Fresh
A few moments seem clunky in retrospect, but overall, the film has aged well. Its still-strong emotional impact is now reinforced with a sense of nostalgia for an age when life was simple.|Fresh
Don't forget to bring tissues.|Fresh
There is hope for the movies, even if that means that the best film currently playing in theaters in 2002 happens to be one of the greatest films to emerge in 1982, or any year.|Fresh
The film remains the kind of unabashed delight that can make even the most cynical filmgoer feel like a kid wrapped up in the fantasy of it all.|Fresh
Oda a la inocencia de la niez, la aventura de la juventud, la majestuosidad del universo y la magia que envuelve a los jvenes de corazn.|Fresh
A devastating rebuke to anyone who has presumed to patronise this great film-maker.|Fresh
As I watched this film 20 years later, it was chastening to note how little of what innocence we once possessed has survived.|Fresh
I'm a tough guy; I can handle this stuff. That's not even a real alien. It's a puppet. Pffff.|Fresh
Bravo.|Fresh
Twenty years after smashing box-office records, Steven Spielberg's gentle sci-fi fable returns to screens as vital and accomplished as ever.|Fresh
Make no mistake about it: The magic of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is best appreciated on the big screen.|Fresh
Spielberg's movie effectively shows adults a world as seen from the point of view of a excited boy.|Fresh
Don't phone home, phone the theater and buy tickets early.|Fresh
If we approach with sympathy and curiosity, we will be rewarded with same. And our souls, not to mention our bicycles, will soar to the heavens.|Fresh
It's a movie with a stationary camera and spare gestures, reminding us of Spielberg's genius for simplicity.|Fresh
The tenderness of the piece is still intact.|Fresh
The hard, cold, cynical me now realizes how precious and rare things like friendship and gentleness can be that the film touched me in different ways than when I was 13.|Fresh
Viewers returning to it, as well as those discovering it, will find it an enduring children's film -- but one whose impact has diminished with the passage of time.|Fresh
Forsaking the overload of special effects and high adventure that marked his previous successes to focus instead on a small story propelled by heart and imagination, Spielberg has made a film that will touch audiences for years to come.|Fresh
A sophisticatedly sappy masterpiece.|Fresh
The new effects might not be to your liking, but the strength of the filmmaking, the power of the story and the wonder of E.T. should be more than enough to warmly remind you of the last time an honest film about childhood innocence was made.|Fresh
It's also a better -- no, make that far better -- movie than nearly everything else that's currently in theaters.|Fresh
Unquestionably a classic.|Fresh
|Fresh
A masterwork.|Fresh
This is an outstanding family movie, with themes of loyalty, friendship, trust, and caring. One of the most purely magical scenes in the history of film is when Elliott's bicycle lifts off up into the sky.|Fresh
We have yet to recover from his revelation: that there is nothing more real than sitting in your own back yard -- waiting for the unreal to come down, take a handful of candy, and fly you to the moon.|Fresh
For the most part, the film does hold up pretty well.|Fresh
A magical film.|Fresh
A sublime modern fairy tale, a movie that, if anything, looks subtler, darker, and more intimate now than it did when originally released.|Fresh
A masterpiece that deserves to be seen and appreciated on a big screen.|Fresh
Feel free to go sob in your popcorn.|Fresh
Steven Spielberg's masterful film has lost none of its power to sweep the viewer away in the most 'excellent' late-20th century boy's adventure one could hope for.|Fresh
The film is a pure gem, proving once again what an incredible visionary Spielberg truly is.|Fresh
What's intact is the film's powerful yet unmushy message of friendship, unconditional love, helping those in need... geez, what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear?|Fresh
Real classics improve with age as does E.T.|Fresh
"...the ""old-fashioned"" puppeteering still works and you do believe in the little guy."|Fresh
It is an exceptionally visual film and an exceptionally emotional film, but the kind that most of us don't mind being manipulated by.|Fresh
E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) is the immensely popular magical fantasy movie myth...|Fresh
Steven Spielberg's E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial showed me for the first time in my life the power of movies.|Fresh
It remains a classic.|Fresh
Spielberg left it open for all of us. That's the sign of a great filmmaker: He only explains what he has to explain.|Fresh
It works because it touches that (uncritical, non-analytical) childlike part of us that we often need to be reminded is still there.|Fresh
It's the epitome of true cinematic art, a movie that touches you on all levels.|Fresh
All the right strings are pulled: one cries, laughs and cheers at all the right places -- just like Spielberg intends us to do.|Fresh
Sweet, heartwarming, adventuresome, and joyful.|Fresh
Only the most hardened heart should be able to resist the glow from the one that anchors this classic.|Fresh
