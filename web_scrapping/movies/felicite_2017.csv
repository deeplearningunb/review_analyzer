With a brilliantly nuanced performance from Véro Tshanda Beya Mputu, simultaneously sullen, vivacious, coquettish, Félicité is the African riposte to the West's obsession with female portraits.|Fresh
Félicité might feel like two movies in one but both parts are ravishing, both unmissable.|Fresh
Félicité contains some of the most powerful moments you'll see in any movie this year. However, Gomis' film never quite amounts to the sum of its impressive parts, its fantasy sequences distracting from, and superfluous to, the main action.|Fresh
Félicité's wonderful soundtrack supplements its incredible writing and editing, and it is my favorite movie so far this year.|Fresh
Everyone may agree on how artful and powerful it is as a human condition study, but not on how entertaining it is.|Fresh
But alongside the documentary detail and casual inequality - at one point Felicite hires on commission a policeman as her debt collector - there are nocturnal interludes, artful detail.|Fresh
... introduces you to people who are enigmatic yet real, and to a country that's ferocious, alive, and resilient enough to survive the worst-like the film's frowning heroine.|Fresh
The film's elements ultimately come together to form a portrait of Félicité, as well as of life in this struggling city. It feels like a cliché to have to note the resilience, cooperation and ingenuity that keep both Félicité and her environment together|Fresh
Gomis approaches her performances with a gritty, gorgeous series of impressions.|Fresh
A neo-realist tale with a soupcon of magical realism that is totally irresistible.|Fresh

...the film doesn't wallow in her dire circumstances and instead celebrates the agency and beauty that exists all around her.|Fresh
[Véro Tshanda] Beya is an unvarnished talent, but she holds the scenario together through the sheer force of her presence|Fresh
The result is a musical and visual feast that is not world-denying, but rather world-affirming in its careful exposition of the quiet pleasures of day-to-day life, and the godly beauty to be found in the resolve of everyday people and relationships.|Fresh
In all, Felicite strikes a powerful chord, taking us into a society in which every reward feels hard won.|Fresh
Gomis needs only enough plot to afford his actors the space and the opportunity to wrestle with the kinds of emotions that most people work scrupulously to avoid.|Fresh
Félicité is a slow-simmer movie that allows the affliction of the lead to shine through--and it's that affliction that makes this watch painful in all the best ways.|Fresh
This heady trip into downtown Kinshasa is as magnetic, and enigmatic, as its forceful central character.|Fresh
A heroic, award-winning central performance from the Congolese actress Véro Tshanda Beya Mputu is reason alone to see this often gripping, occasionally infuriating French-language melodrama.|Fresh
It's a film with seriousness and compassion, though a little lengthy and diffuse. Dramatic storm clouds gather and pass overhead without ever quite bursting into rain.|Fresh
Urgently expressive in colour and varied in texture, it's a Congolese Mother Courage.|Fresh
Anchored by an astonishing central performance from newcomer Mputu, Félicité overcomes its less successful elements to become an intense, intriguing character study of a fascinating woman.|Fresh
Gomis' film paints a lacerating picture of a raucous, dangerous city.|Fresh
Drama about how music eases the pain of a seasoned survivor struggling with some unexpected challenges.|Fresh
The movie's popping at full boil, and you're caffeinated, ready for whatever may come..|Fresh
Félicité expresses the moods of life with a magnetic, potent grace.|Fresh
The film's tonal range is formidable enough to suggest that this director may be a major talent who's now emerging from relative obscurity.|Fresh
The movie is a virtual documentary of city sights and moods, and also a bitter exposé of a country without a social safety net.|Fresh
Félicité is a work of art. It is also the anguish in everyday day survival when you are losing your will to live that makes the film largely captivating.|Fresh
Paints a dim picture of Kinshasa, but does it well.|Fresh
Félicité alluringly oscillates from the high-energy, casually tragic reality of the street to the faintly phantasmagorical serenity of the nocturnal realm and back again.|Fresh
Alain Gomis never reconciles throughout how the film's disparate parts are meant to fit together.|Rotten
"Although the existence of ""Félicité,"" might only possible because the resources of the French and larger European film industry, its humanist, musical vibrancy makes a major case for the significance and individuality of African cinema."|Fresh
A graceful and deeply sympathetic piece of work.|Fresh
Felicité is a challenging, perhaps overlong, but also quietly resonant slice of new African cinema.|Fresh
It's intense if somewhat choppy filmmaking, although the passion of the amateur cast and vividness of the Kinshasa locations help make up for the narrative shortcomings.|Fresh
Gomis' latest ... [weaves] a sensual, sometimes hopeful, sometimes disturbing urban tapestry with threads of image, sound, poetry, and song.|Fresh
