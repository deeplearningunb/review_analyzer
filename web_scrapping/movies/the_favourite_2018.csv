The Favourite is funny, laugh out loud so. If it weren't, it would be unbearable|Fresh
Entertaining, garish and impeccably acted, The Favourite is a morality play on the double standard we use to measure men and women's ambitions, without being too pandering.|Fresh
"Terrific turns from a talented triumvirate--Colman, Weisz, and Stone--cannot compensate for ""The Favourite""'s calculated archness (and ickiness)."|Rotten
The Favourite is great fun, with a dash of tragedy and the caution to be careful what you wish for.|Fresh
These three women play off of each other superbly, bringing a pathos lying in wait behind all that caustic wit.|Fresh
Though the journey is greater than the destination, The Favourite is still an intoxicating thrill ride to endure.|Fresh
The Favourite is a complex and bewildering essay by Yorgos Lanthimos on the pathetic necessities of political power. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

"On occasion, a film like ""The Favourite"" comes along to upend convention and tell a compelling historical narrative with visceral, vicious energy."|Fresh
Delicious and vicious, the early 18th century court of Queen Anne has never looked loopier and more fascinatingly relevant than in The Favourite.|Fresh
"""Lanthimos has directed his first major work. Or his first masterpiece?""."|Fresh
Despite the empathy that actors have for their characters, the hyper ironic and self-aware stylisation gives Lanthimos a smug authoritative 'smartness' over everything depicted on-screen.|Rotten
The Favourite, which features scatological humor, gout and a pet duck among its political and romantic court intrigues.|Fresh
A fabricated romantic romp for folks more concerned about a historical drama's entertainment value than its commitment to the facts.|Fresh
The Favourite was not my favorite film of the year, though the costumes are magnificent. Rather than a humorous film, I thought it a sad, tragic story of royalty and aristocrats fighting over status and playing at governing.|Rotten
Colman, Stone, and Weisz make the story alternately grotesque, dramatic, light without them changing their register. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ever wondered what Yorgos Lanthimos' version of Keeping Up with the Kardashians would look like?|Fresh
An incredible infusion of modernity and Restoration-era Great Britain-a boisterous, farcical, and unapologetically inexplicable update on the royal British period piece.|Fresh
The movie singlehandedly upends decades of unimaginative habits by British filmmakers who have generally treated history as well-behaved pageants with period-perfect costumes and lavish settings.|Fresh
Colman's performance as Queen Anne is worthy of Charles Laughton in its lack of vanity and its ever-building pathos.|Fresh
In the end, The Favourite is a haunting reminder of the limits of control.|Fresh
The Favourite [is Yorgos Lanthimos'] most conventional but equally venomous film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz all deliver career-best performances in this quirky look back at the politics of yesteryear...|Fresh
Wonderfully arranged and wickedly funny film.|Fresh
"What I love about Stone's twisted performance in The Favourite is that her role so aggressively asks the question, ""what if I were the protagonist of this story?"""|Fresh
An effective drama that portrays the English Court in a rather harsh, even incisive way. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman shine. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...an utter trainwreck that makes one long for the comparative mastery of Lanthimos' earlier endeavors.|Rotten
It is hard to think of a more formidable trio to grace the screen with such skill and bravery this year.|Fresh
In short, for the first time, a Lanthimos film brought me sheer enjoyment.|Fresh
Another of the film's myriad strong points is the way gender roles are subtly reversed as the women totally command the film and rule proceedings within the story.|Fresh
Historical accuracy is secondary in The Favourite because Lanthimos explores the truth in how human beings hurt each other when they don't understand what exactly hurts them. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lanthimos presents these games of seduction, these internal fights for power with elegance. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Colman is as disconcerting as she is admirable. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Undoubtedly the film's main success is the performances of Rachel, Olivia and Emma. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lanthimos takes us from laughter to amazement and turns in a film with ties to the works of Peter Greenaway. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Olivia Colman, in an instantly classic and iconic role, embodies Queen Anne. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Favourite shines as an absorbent exploration of love and how our yearnings are destroyed by a social structure hellbent on social violence and a clash of the classes. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lanthimos develops each character with comprehension and almost a tenderness. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The ending is a little odd, but it wouldn't be a Yorgos Lanthimos film without it. If you are in the mood for a little mischief, mayhem and marvelous acting - The Favourite is definitely the film for you.|Fresh
[The Favorite] all goes down with a touch of British whimsy, laced with a Yorgosian sense of doom, with a few traces of All About Eve.|Fresh
Colman's performance is exquisite in all its raw and sometimes ugly forms. Stone and Weisz create equally complex characters with layers that captivate your attention.|Fresh
Lanthimos retains a pessimistic view of human nature, while also showing the profane the conventions of the cinematic subgenre of kings and courtiers. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lanthimos creates Vermeer-like montages with wide angles draped in light that caresses inanimate objects and people alike so that scenes become eternal moments.|Fresh
A triumph in many ways. It showcases an off-kilter sense of humor and a special conglomeration of carnality, darkness, fragility, and opulence.|Fresh
Extraordinary Olivia Colman, a carnival of nuances and contradictions that, miraculously, converge in a moving humanity. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a grownups-only art-house spin on British history.|Fresh
Pushes the idea of the capricious monarch through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. Colman embodies sublimely the punch-drunk confusion of a woman unsure whether she's child or adult, plaything or puppet-master.|Fresh
If you're on an existential quest for meaning, look elsewhere. This film is pure entertainment, irreverent, surreal, sumptuous in set design, costumes, make-up, and spot-on in editing and acting; but it's not for the serious meaning seeker.|Fresh
Often accused of ham-fisted endings, Lanthimos triumphs here.|Fresh
As adversaries scheming and jockeying for the queen's favor, Stone and Weisz are at the top of their form, with Colman holding the center.|Fresh
Lanthimos presents a heartrending feminist story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Favourite moves at a cracking pace and you'll be hard pressed to pick a favourite out of the three leading actresses.|Fresh
What sets The Favourite apart from similar tales of royal bickering, though, is Lanthimos' willingness to depict the blood sport of politics without engaging in it himself.|Fresh
The mordant characterisation and precision staging make for an unsettling and unkind spectacle.|Fresh
It's a genuinely funny, wacky take on a historical drama|Fresh
With its blend of period drama and comedy, of biography, fiction and sheer historical speculation, The Favourite is the most affable and approachable Yorgos Lanthimos' movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Favourite marks an unexpected course in the filmography of an author increasingly free, mature and with a firmer pulse to bother.|Fresh
Surprisingly unmemorable and monotonous, and has essentially been done before, in much better ways, by the likes of Marie Antoinette, Love and Friendship, and even Blackadder!|Rotten
Political films in which women are depicted as both protagonist and antagonist are almost nonexistent, which is already enough to set director Yorgos Lanthimos' effort apart.|Fresh
Like a courtier waiting interminably for an audience with the monarch, the tedium outweighs the anticipation.|Rotten
There are certain suggestive symbolisms, but the duration is not directly proportional to the level of depth that it reaches. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The three leads are able to hold a fascinating performance that is difficult to achieve. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A drastic change from Yargos Lanthimos's usual style of dispassionate commentary of societal transgressions, The Favourite is much more rhythmically paced and emotionally frank as it explores the intimacy of power dynamics in relationships.|Fresh
With its brilliantly acerbic and dramatic script, great performances, a strong thematic and dramatic backbone, wonderful production design contributions and strikingly off-kilter cinematography, The Favourite is my front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar.|Fresh
That cyclothymic queen and her relationship with her two lovers are intriguing, the dialogues have sharpness. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's one of the best historical dramas I can remember seeing, but it's also one that I'm quite OK never seeing again.|Fresh
The Favourite thrills, delights, and even touches the heart in its giddy chase of power and what its pursuit can do to us.|Fresh
Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and Olivia Colman reign in this absolutely topical period film with a great deal of cunning and manipulation. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I can think of no better review for Yorgos Lanthimos' The Favourite than the man sitting next to me in the theater audibly gasping four different times at the cinematography.|Fresh
This film is mean but hilarious; visually arresting and stunningly acted.|Fresh
The Favourite, from wildly creative and original director Yorgos Lanthimos, is unlike any period costume drama you've ever seen.|Fresh
The Favourite doesn't demean the women by pretending that they are saints.|Fresh
"Weisz is splendidly imperious and Stone more than holds her own among the British cast, though the lesser-known Colman is what truly binds ""The Favourite"" to history."|Fresh
... a triple-threat of Baroque fatales flirting with the highest stakes imaginable. For those with the squirm-worthy stomach for decadent aristocracy and boundless ambition, its deliciously wicked.|Fresh
This film is especially suitable for Anglophiles, particularly those who are familiar with these historical characters and who care about upper class affairs.|Fresh
The Favourite may be his first period piece, but the royal court of early 18th century Britain proves suitable stomping ground for Lanthimos.|Fresh
For all Lanthimos followers, The Favourite will be his most accessible piece to date, but displaying the same preoccupation with power games he has shown since Dogtooth (2009).|Fresh
The Favourite is like Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve meets Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, blurring the lines between pastiche and parody of period-piece chamber dramas.|Fresh
"""The Favourite"" isn't even a pale imitation of the sardonic satire that it aspires to. Where is the Marquis de Sade when you need him most?"|Rotten
THE FAVOURITE is a wonderfully nasty treat.|Fresh
A stunning trifecta of women lead this delectably vicious tale on the gluttony of power.|Fresh
The Favourite deserves all the acclaim and plaudits it's been showered with and more and it's a delight to see Lanthimos keeping his quirkier tendencies at bay and crafting a sly, joyous, gloriously elegant comedy/drama of manners.|Fresh
Working for the first time from someone else's script, Lanthimos trades his signature sadism for cutting wit; meanwhile, his jaundiced eye remains evident in the fish-eye lenses that distort the compositions.|Fresh
The Favourite is an odd amalgamation, a sex farce in costume drama's clothing...sumptuously filmed and audaciously performed...a cracked-mirror Merchant-Ivory production.|Fresh
Certainly the year's most bombastic, perversely funny feature, The Favourite may be for more open-minded audiences, but it's such a charmingly quirky film.|Fresh
What a blazing and burning feat of melodrama.|Fresh
While these three headlining performances are fine, soon the nastiness takes over and things stop being quite so funny... Lanthimos' film is still strong, sometimes brilliantly funny stuff for the first half, but eventually it turns altogether too grim.|Rotten
In some ways, the movie is tame for Lanthimos, far less obtuse than his previous works, but The Favourite is no less complex in its portrayal of women, sex, and power.|Fresh
It's Colman, however, who rules this roost. Her Queen Anne is a monster, a big baby and a soul in torment, and frequently all three at once.|Fresh
I couldn't fault a single thing, it's seriously good fun.|Fresh
It's a tangled tale, with enough scheming, spying, treachery and cattiness to fill an entire mini-series.|Fresh
The kind of spark plug period piece that only comes around once in a queen's reign. Don't miss it.|Fresh
Those excellent performances salvaged The Favourite from being a trainwreck.|Rotten
This is The Crown like you've never seen it before.|Fresh
Reuniting with his Lobster stars Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz, and getting Emma Stone in on the act, director Yorgos Lanthimos runs riot in the 18th century with this period romp.|Fresh
It is savagely funny and often preposterous, with duck racing and ludicrous, vertiginous wigs and an astonishingly weird dance scene. Yet it is also involving and deeply moving with performances that are monumentally stellar.|Fresh
The performances are staggering and endearingly comic.|Fresh
With its 18th-century foppery, baroque soundtrack and uncompromisingly clever repartee, it will be too rich a cake for some. But it has three of the best female acting performances you'll see [this year].|Fresh
Clever, beautiful, fantastically acted, saucy, dark and really funny, it's an absolute gem.|Fresh
Though lacking the savage vigour of Lanthimos' previous films, The Favourite's expert acting and deliciously funny script makes for an intoxicating mix.|Fresh
Olivia Colman excels as Queen Anne.|Fresh
Bestial cunning and instinct run riot through this deliciously Machiavellian period drama.|Fresh
Three formidable females form a deliciously entertaining triangle in an audacious frock opera.|Fresh
Lanthimos has made a film that plays like a diabolical union between Ken Russell and Robert Bresson, full of savage rhythms and emotional distance.|Fresh
The Favourite gratifyingly proves that Lanthimos can put his mordantly idiosyncratic stamp on even the staidest of genres.|Fresh
If this were a story involving Henry VIII or George III viewers might have a better idea of who the major characters were and would recognize the historic context of the film.|Fresh
Despite the nominally historical setting, this has none of the staid distance of a costume drama. On the contrary, it feels cruelly, deliciously contemporary...|Fresh
Breaking: Olivia Colman is our new god.|Fresh
Once you settle into the tone of the piece, it's one of the finest recent examples of directorial mannerisms propping up the strengths of words and vice versa.|Fresh
The film is largely an ornately staged, staid wordfest. It features the odd cuss word, naughty sex and some brutal behaviour, but none of the director's stylistic touches make up for the film's overall lack of tension.|Rotten
It's real filmmaking. It's real writing.|Fresh
The next day, I was still laughing about things... that dancing scene, I just woke up one day thinking about that.|Fresh
This is a delightful movie, funny, absurd, anarchic and profound.|Fresh
The bulk of this ribald yarn is well worth putting on your best finery for. It's not quite the homerun it's advertised to be, but an expertly rendered delight all the same.|Fresh
The Favourite doesn't offer horrors to compare with Lanthimos's The Lobster or his The Killing of a Sacred Deer, but the creative misanthropy and orchestral cruelty are every bit as striking.|Fresh
Enormously funny and enormously nasty.|Fresh
In the leads, Olivia Colman is magnificently unhinged and colossally bewildered as the good Queen.|Fresh
Lushly furnished yet gleefully grotesque, all involved, especially leads Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz thrive on the malice within the eighteenth-century royal setting.|Fresh
The Favourite is a visually sumptuous, morally repulsive and wildly funny portrait of the way political power congeals around the greed, narcissism and fear of its participants.|Fresh
Sardonically dark, deliciously nasty, and raucously glorious, 'The Favourite' is an absolute triumph.|Fresh
"The Favourite is a special holiday gift just for you: a weird and wonderful sod-off response to all the many lavish, solemn, toff-worshipping British ""heritage films"" and TV series centered on the domestic lives of royals."|Fresh
Colman, always brilliant, has never seemed more divine. If she's not nominated for an Oscar, I will cry.|Fresh
The Favourite is an uncomfortably empowering feminist film, allowing its female characters to strive for an equal sense of malice and cruelty.|Fresh
Quite simply, an utter and hilarious delight.|Fresh
"A pioneer of the ""Weird Wave"" of Greek cinema, Lanthimos brings his outsider's eye to period English costume drama in a film that loosens its corsets considerably."|Fresh
Weird, dirty but accessible, The Favourite is a perfectly performed, thrillingly made period picture that morphs before your very eyes.|Fresh
The Favourite is so assaultively entertaining that you keep wanting to go outside for fresh air.|Fresh
The ensemble is one of the best of the year ... They all embody this story's particular horrors, hang-ups, and larks without missing any beats, shifting with ample dexterity.|Fresh
A bawdy, twisted, and unsettling film that is guaranteed to be discussed in creative circles for years to come.|Fresh
The comedy is black hole-level dark -- primarily driven by acrimony, paranoia, and just plain ol' meanness -- and perfectly juxtaposes the beautiful regal dressings.|Fresh
It feels cruelly contemporary.|Fresh
As well as being [Lanthimos'] biggest production so far, this is by far his most pleasurable, with three Oscar-worthy performances.|Fresh
Those expecting a staid and stuffy period drama will be taken aback by the outrageousness that The Favourite displays not only in word but in deed.|Fresh
Deliciously witty, visually gorgeous and frequently unsettling in its melding of the comic and the chilling, The Favourite is one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Devious, disturbing and darkly funny, The Favourite is, well, the best.|Fresh
Uproarious, down-and-dirty, obscene and completely on its own weird and wicked wavelength...|Fresh
Lanthimos continues his hot streak behind the camera, giving us his most accesible and funniest offering so far, and in turn, one of the best films of 2018. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The plot turns are too delicious to spoil.|Fresh
The clash between an explicit contemporary sensibility and what defines the aesthetics of England at the end of the 18th century seems to be what defines the ostentatious and irresistible visual proposal of this production. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The highly combustive feminine firepower consistently ignited by the three leads here is a wonder to behold, as is the withering wit of the screenplay, and the mesmerising direction of in-form filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos.|Fresh
Lanthimos remains true to his Dadaist exuberances, but here applies them with a fresh refinement.|Fresh
A wicked delight.|Fresh
The Favourite is a rare period drama that goes beyond merely re-hashing a sensationalised past.|Fresh
It's a delightfully venomous pair of performances from Weisz and Stone who serve and volley salvos of shrewd deceitfulness at each other. But Colman's portrayal of Queen Anne steals the show with a pained but often hilarious performance.|Fresh
The characters as written never achieve the resonance that would keep viewers engaged and invested in them. They remain pawns in an exercise of mannered absurdity.|Rotten
...three stellar performance and first rate production...made me want to know more about what amounts to the early feminist movement.|Fresh
Watching The Favourite is like receiving a beautifully wrapped gift, with beautiful wrapping and silken ribbon, only to open it and be confronted by the horrific spectacle of a dead, rotting rat. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing.|Fresh
The Favourite is a rich, dark comedy filled with great one-liners and unexpected twists.|Fresh
The Favourite as a film meanders a bit and isn't nearly as perfect as its cast, but the performances endure.|Fresh
The moment that Hoult opens his mouth, the level of profane and vile language clues you into what you're watching: an elaborately set up and executed parody of the genre.|Fresh
It might be Lanthimos' most straightforward piece since Dogtooth, its dry humor keeping us sharp and ready to expect the unexpected.|Fresh
The music was beautiful, the acting was wonderful, but it's 100-percent a movie I won't remember exists a month from now...it had good stuff in it, but it just wasn't good.|Rotten
"You'll know more than you ever wanted to know after viewing ""The Favourite,"" a spectacular and brilliantly acted biopic - with liberties, if not justice, for all."|Fresh
Brilliant, brittle dialogue, three amazing female actors and a setting of the English court of Queen Anne (her reign was 1702-07) are enough to make this sumptuous, cynical and gorgeous film a worthwhile Oscar contender.|Fresh
Weird and wild Yorgos Lanthimos actually delivers a mostly accessible period piece with the randiness of 'Tom Jones' and the cunning of 'All About Eve.' Three leading ladies and an indelible final image speak volumes, too.|Fresh
Lanthimos makes grand use of wide-angle and low-light lenses, along with the kinds of long-form tracking shots that come directly out of the Kubrickian palette.|Fresh
Thanks to the bravura trio of actresses, The Favourite offers underneath a simple, timely, all-too-human tale of jealousy, survival and power.|Fresh
The movie hits the mark in every single frame. There isn't a misstep in the entire two hours... It's played as farce, and it works.|Fresh
Strangely enough, it may be through its beasts that The Favourite makes the strongest case that women are, in fact, humans.|Fresh
"As the schemes escalate, watching ""The Favourite"" is a lot of fun. But the cream curdles after a while, as Abigail and Sarah's war starts to draw real blood, take real casualties."|Fresh
This surrealist exercise in historical revisionism benefits from a trio of wonderful performances by its lead actresses.|Fresh
"It's complex and daring, with a focus on three women's relationships amid devious scheming, profane dialogue and political threats reminiscent of ""Veep"" and slapstick that would make the Three Stooges proud."|Fresh
"For those who think historical costume dramas, particularly ones set among the English monarchy, are dry and tedious affairs, fasten your corsets and prepare for the exhilaratingly bumpy ride of ""The Favourite."""|Fresh
Three of the best performances of the year. One of the best films. Period.|Fresh
Lanthimos ... creates [a] simmering mood of tension, jealousy and rage that layers itself over every scene like a fine dust. The Favourite is quietly perfect.|Fresh
Lanthimos takes a lean and witty script about conniving women and weak men and imbues it with his own peculiar and pitiless absurdism. The result feels like an outrageously opulent cross between Dangerous Liaisons and All About Eve.|Fresh
Fruity is what it is, sometimes squashy and overripe, sometimes firm and appealing, but everything about this film is rich and slightly pungent, including the characters.|Fresh
A wonderfully acerbic piece on a sumptuous backdrop of regal decadence, The Favourite is salacious, savage and hypnotic.|Fresh
...like a failed attempt to make a Peter Greenaway film, though without any of his imagination or instinctual flair.|Rotten
Deliciously funny . It is 'All About Eve' in the 18th Century in the court of Queen Anne. Performances could not be better.|Fresh
The three main performances are delightful to behold. Colman's unpredictability and her constant shifts in mood and tone are extraordinary to watch.|Fresh
An acerbic and abrasively funny period piece featuring three of the best female performances of the year. The film is like a formal curtsy but with a sharp knee strike to the groin.|Fresh
Featuring a trio of the best performances of the year, The Favourite is a roiling tale of deception, sex, twisted friendship and power.|Fresh
A wickedly funny and giddily lurid tale of palace intrigue that has its middle finger extended defiantly at established convention from its very first frame.|Fresh
Maybe Lanthimos does have a heart after all.|Fresh
The boredom and dryness still dominate to blast away chances for connection like buckshot through a targeted pigeon's feathers and flesh.|Fresh
Lanthimos walks right up to the edge of mocking his characters for having feelings, and us for having feelings about them.|Fresh
The three leads are all splendid, especially Weisz.|Fresh
Lanthimos has crafted a deliciously dark comedic gold mine -- anchored by three of the best performances of 2018.|Fresh
You have to be some kind of an actor to steal a movie from both Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. Well, Olivia Colman is some kind of an actor.|Fresh
Olivia Colman, if there is any justice in this world, ought to get an Academy Award for her tragically pathetic and miserably afraid turn.|Fresh
A quick-witted, profane and cynical quasi-comedy in which history is merely a costume.|Fresh
Many will guffaw heartily throughout the increasingly bonkers The Favourite, but there isn't one cheap laugh here. The drama has heft, horror and fathoms of heartbreak below the surface.|Fresh
It's The Madness of King George filtered through the alienating wealth of Roeg's Man Who Fell to Earth.|Fresh
Immensely entertaining... With all of its cutthroat machinations, pathetic figureheads, and behind-closed-doors absurdity, you'd be forgiven for assuming it came from the minds behind HBO's Veep.|Fresh
I don't know what [Lanthimos] meant this one to be, but it's his funniest by far.|Fresh
The Favourite is wickedly funny. The palace intrigue plunges into the absurd with devilish abandon. Director Yorgos Lanthimos continues to be an edgy and surrealistic filmmaker.|Fresh
I found myself wanting to live inside each and every frame of this marvelous achievement.|Fresh
The Favourite is a fiendishly fun time.|Fresh
It is Colman who steals the film from everyone - Lanthimos included.|Fresh
Yorgos is back with his expected brand of eccentric and original film making. One of my favourite flicks of the year!|Fresh
Serves as a corrective to all those fluffy period movies where pretty costumes and set design function as the cinematic equivalent of a bubble bath.|Fresh
Every holiday season seems to bring a costume epic that's packing serious heat underneath all the gowns and frippery. This year, it's The Favourite.|Fresh
If you like Machiavellian and deliciously intriguing films, don't miss The Favorite, a visual feast that will surprise you with its beauty, rudeness, rawness and ingenious evil. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Armed with Lanthimos' trademark weirdness and three great lead performances, The Favourite is a truly unique spin on the typical royal court drama.|Fresh
"While it clearly won't be for all audiences -- the ""Masterpiece Theater"" crowd might have to pick their jaws up off the floor -- the film is otherwise a blast to behold. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"|Fresh
This is a universal, essentially timeless tale, exquisitely mounted and perfectly cast. It comes to American theaters with a justifiable reputation as one of the year's best.|Fresh
Despite its talented cast, the film feels a little under-cooked to truly warrant a seat on the throne.|Rotten
"""The Favourite"" is decadent fun."|Fresh
The Favourite is a baroque masterpiece of savage delights with a trio of masterful female performances.|Fresh
What sets apart The Favourite most from Lanthimos's previous features is not so much the time period, but its softer treatment of the human body and its many desires.|Fresh
There is tenderness and understanding written into each one of these women, who are just trying to survive as the patriarchy at play is looking to deject each one of them, no matter how powerful.|Fresh
I command you to see it.|Fresh
"I started jotting down clever dialogue from ""The Favourite"" in my notepad but I had to stop when I realized I was essentially transcribing the entire script."|Fresh
Shamelessly entertaining historical comedy. Humour entwines with tragedy here, with bold touches of absurdism and iconoclastic revisionism.|Fresh
The bluntness in Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara's screenplay isn't wit. The script defeats the actors.|Rotten
A diverting look at political intrigue and power plays.|Fresh
Who the heck knows how accurate any of this is, but Lanthimos creates a total world with people we wouldn't recognise today.|Fresh
The talent is there for the taking, and while Lanthimos dares to make something partially accessible here, he doesn't lose any of his idiosyncrasy.|Fresh
For those with a taste for historical fiction, The Favourite is a delicious morsel with a spicy aftertaste.|Fresh
When it comes time to take stock of the damage, it's almost shocking. Which is precisely the point, of course: it's all fun and games until someone loses their soul.|Fresh
Under a hail of uproarious rage and absurdity, The Favourite subverts the idea that only one kind of person can become a slave to the process.|Fresh
The Favourite boasts a sense of humour that might be an acquired taste, but it's written in such a profoundly unique way that the film would hold a great deal of interest even if the viewer doesn't find it particularly funny.|Fresh
The film is directed with gobs of wit and style by Lanthimos and the costumes and sets are jaw-dropping. In the end though, this is a three-woman show-and it's nothing short of a privilege to watch them work.|Fresh
A high-court historical pantomime on par with Stillman's delightful Love & Friendship, slathered with a heaping helping of anger like mud marring a delicate ball gown.|Fresh
Lanthimos' production is one of the most beautiful and intriguing of the year - though it's unlikely to be your favorite.|Fresh
The Favourite is nasty, hilarious, obscene, absurd, and exquisite.|Fresh
The real fun here is in the three central performances, each of which threatens to steal the film|Fresh
The most stunning thing about The Favourite is how it slices open three queer women and lets their messy humanity bleed all over you.|Fresh
The Favourite is one of the best of 2018...|Fresh
The Favourite embraces the humor and hubris of royalty behaving badly to deliver one of 2018's best films.|Fresh
[Director Yorgos Lanthimos] puts his signature stiffness to a more appropriate milieu and lets the bitter juice fly naturally without dulling his misanthropic knives one bit.|Fresh
It's a delightful twist on more traditional movies of its genre(s). For a unique cinematic experience, take a ride on the darker side.|Fresh
An acidic send-up of the whole Masterpiece Theatre genre, shattering its veneer of decorum with icy wit and some utterly scurrilous invention, all in a style mingling flamboyance and surrealism.|Fresh
It's easy to say that The Favourite is Lanthimos' Barry Lyndon, but it's also accurate.|Fresh
Devilish fun as Colman, Stone, and Weisz take the British monarchy for a rollicking jaunt. One of 2018's best films.|Fresh
Sensual, yet nasty and sardonic, Yorgos Lanthimos' opulent costume drama is a bizarre historical farce.|Rotten
The talented Greek pulls out all the stops to give you everything you want in a ribald period piece in which treachery runs rampant and it's executed with the sharpest of knives -- and tongues.|Fresh
Under the direction of Yorgos Lanthimos, the atmosphere is bawdy and baroque, like a trippy funhouse.|Fresh
"The Favourite is, recognizably, a ""well-acted"" movie, full of briskly bitchy backbiting, but the films that preceded it created a performance style that asked the viewer to reconsider their existing criteria for good and bad."|Fresh
The dualities provided by Weisz and Stone are wonderful: hot vs. cold, scheming vs. naïve, with ambition ultimately winning out. But Anne is something else, in every sense of the phrase. And so is The Favourite.|Fresh
Contains a trio of performances that are so commanding, perfectly calibrated with the right amount of showiness and underlying character depth, and overflowing with jealousy, they deserve every ensemble award that exists|Fresh
As the intrigue heightens in The Favourite, so do the film's surreal touches.|Fresh
A modern, invigorating portrait of women as powerful as they are flawed.|Fresh
None of it works without the three wonderful performances from Colman, Stone and Weisz. It is difficult to overstate the strength of the trio's contribution to the success of the film.|Fresh
It's a well-acted, handsomely-mounted production, full of delightful scheming. However, it never finds that extra gear to propel it into greatness|Fresh
Hats off and huzzah to the three main actors.|Fresh
Adroitly juggles cheerfully bizarre and delightfully rude humor, moments of genuinely felt emotion and stellar performances from three wonderful actresses in an acerbic meditation on power, greed and jealousy.|Fresh
It's nasty and knowing but way too self-satisfyingly smart-alecky for its own good.|Rotten
It succeeds as the nastiest high stakes workplace comedy you'll see all year.|Fresh
Sumptuous period settings and top-notch performances.|Fresh
It's a period piece with a wink. It's also funny as hell and a true big-screen treat.|Fresh
The Favourite is at turns hilarious, intriguing and depressing but remains a singular cinematic event that culminates in the disparate elements joining together to paint a woeful picture of humanity.|Fresh
Weisz has a field day with the acerbic dialogue, locating the uniquely arch frequency that director Yorgos Lanthimos plies here.|Fresh
The Favourite is cruel but funny, funny but thoughtful, and thoughtful but bizarre. That it is all of these things simultaneously is an impressive feat.|Fresh
That female power dynamic, and how Sarah and Abigail snipe, cajole, menace, flatter, and even bully Anne to get their way is a rare delight.|Fresh
This sick parody of political ambition suggests a Vice Media version of a corrupted Merchant Ivory film -- Anglophilia that is fascinated by the worst of British eccentricity.|Rotten
Period authenticity clashes happily with occasional creative anachronisms to present audiences with a portrait of power as sobering as it is scabrously conniving.|Fresh
Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz, Olivia Colman - it's fun just to think of them in the same thought, let alone on the same screen.|Fresh
All three actresses are cast to their strengths, Colman delivering the slipperiest, most complex performance, her Queen gaining confidence in her own abilities as others are distracted by their own power struggles.|Fresh
The Favourite walks a taught, thrilling line between humor and suffering.|Fresh
Stone's never been better than she is here, as the character of Abigail threads a perilous needle.|Fresh
"I don't know if Lanthimos is saying anything especially novel about the machinations of those in power, but he's such an inventive visual thinker, he gives ""The Favourite"" a bracing momentum."|Fresh
This contemporary costume drama proves that petticoats and parasols don't make a movie stuffy.|Fresh
The Favourite is funny and sexy and sad and weird, and ultimately a portrait of loneliness, as no one ends up with what they need, only whatever power they can grab.|Fresh
It's remarkable, the range of behavior that Colman harmonizes into one complex humanity, from the sublimely sweet to the grotesque.|Fresh
[A] faster, funnier, infinitely nastier best picture Oscar contender.|Fresh
"A Restoration comedy filtered through this director's eccentric, modern sensibilities is what ""The Favourite"" most resembles - witty, profane, sexually explicit, improper in the extreme, a comedy of manners without any manners at all."|Fresh
ll three actors brew up a a swirling tornado of brilliance by feeding off of each other's talents, the result is damn-near cathartic.|Fresh
The humor in The Favourite requires a level of estrangement and distance with history and the upper-class.|Rotten
Lanthimos has widened his palette, while keeping his unique, strange and acidic humor intact.|Fresh
Ask tomorrow which performance is the movie's best, and the answer may be different. It's that kind of film, and they are those kinds of actors.|Fresh
It's one of the best movies of the year, and it's a must-see in theaters for its incredible performances and artistic look from costumes to set to cinematography. It will hopefully get nominated for many Oscars.|Fresh
It's as bleak and nasty as Lanthimos' previous work, but it's also infused with more recognizable humanity than I've seen from him before -- which makes the funny stuff funnier, and the icky stuff infinitely ickier.|Fresh
This is a loathsome, sloppy film, defaming all three women, but particularly Sarah Churchill, with distasteful falsehoods. Sadly, most who see it will come out believing it.|Rotten
If you think the quickest way to a queen's heart is through her 17 pet bunny rabbits then have I got the delicious movie for you.|Fresh
Director Yorgos Lanthimos adds a dose of wicked, whiplash humor to his usual bleakness in this largely effective costume movie, filled with deep-focus visuals and strong, ferocious women.|Fresh
THE FAVOUITE is a smart, satisfying and devilishly cruel tale that is far more fun than you'd imagine|Fresh
Gorgeous in its production design and filled to the brim with heartless people spouting wonderfully wounding dialogue.|Fresh
Colman, Stone, and Weisz are solid gold for Lanthimos. They take to his particular style brilliantly.|Fresh
Witty and dramatic, The Favourite offers the path of least resistance for anyone not swooned by Lathimos's brand of filmmaking.|Fresh
Each of these female actors is well equipped to carry a film alone, but together --- they are dynamic. THE FAVOURITE will not suit everyone, but I found it incredibly entertaining.|Fresh
An unusually provocative presentation given the time frame and its place in history. Furthermore, the trio of actresses who anchor the story could not be better.|Fresh
Lanthimos takes a great deal of pleasure in depicting the scheming involved. The movie has a core of dry, biting wit...|Fresh
Bathed in a score of Vivaldi, Bach, and Purcell, it's Lanthimos's most watchable movie to date, and also his best. The Favourite is a triumph in textures, a beam of light through a window.|Fresh
It's a sensorial delight, a delicious morsel of court decadence, rivalry, and intrigue, with enough wit and rage to pierce your gut and leave you writhing.|Fresh
The Favourite's trio of leads - Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone - turn in some of the best performances of the year.|Fresh
Any concern that an elegantly mounted, star-studded period piece set during the War of Spanish Succession might have diluted Greek surrealist Yorgos Lanthimos' particular brand of sadism turns out to be entirely unwarranted.|Fresh
The Favourite is a tart examination of power dynamics among women that should be consumed by those who love their humor dark and their history complex.|Fresh
The cattiest movie of the year in the best way humanly possible.|Fresh
The Favourite is the wittiest film to date from directorYorgos Lanthimos and is brought to life largely by three strong women.|Fresh
Lanthimos' renegade deviltry turns a period piece into a bawdy, brilliant triumph. Expect Oscar to bow down to Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and the mighty Olivia Colman as Queen Anne for bringing a #MeToo punch to 18th-century British politics.|Fresh
Is this the first Yorgos Lanthimos film that can be called genuinely fun?|Fresh
I always dread period pieces, that it's going to be all highfalutin royalty and frilly dresses and antiquated customs that don't interest me. The Favourite will still satisfy those die-hard costume drama fans, but it won me over too.|Fresh
Though mostly twaddle as history, Yorgos Lanthimos's The Favourite is wonderful, nasty fun, a period drama (wigs, breeches, beauty spots) that holds the screen with gnashing teeth and slashing nails.|Fresh
YAAAAS, queen!|Fresh
With his rich visual aesthetic and sharp-witted flare, Lanthimos - like our dueling cousins - pulls out all the stops to make The Favourite hilariously unforgettable.|Fresh
Lanthimos' most accessible movie to date, 'The Favourite' is simply awe-inspiring in the way it harbors serious themes and anxieties about womanhood underneath a deceptively feather-light surface.|Fresh
Regardless of your tolerance for Restoration jabberwocky, you will be forced to admit the performance by Olivia Colman as England's dim-witted Queen Anne is a masterpiece of madness.|Fresh
As compelling as it is to watch, this film is also a reminder that sometimes you can respect the hell out of something and still be miserable as hell watching it.|Rotten
Even when the movie's self-love gets to be a bit much, there are stylistic touches to enjoy.|Fresh
The film gamely tackles class and gender themes, as well as partisan politics, in its tale of women behaving badly and men being nitwits.|Fresh
[Colman] beams and scowls, brays and bleeds, shatters and disintegrates. She rules.|Fresh
A bracing rethink of the historical costumer.|Fresh
"Nobody in ""The Favourite"" could be described as a noble specimen of humanity, and yet, from the mean and grasping shenanigans that pass for a plot, there rises an unmistakable whiff of-believe it or not-fun."|Fresh
Even though this is a period piece about a royal struggle, it's themes of scheming to gain the favor of a mentally unstable leader still ring true today.|Fresh
The dialog is fiendishly clever, packed with barbed insults and lacerating observations that reveal a lot about both the society and the people.|Fresh
[The Favourite] is the monster that Lanthimos wants to welcome, the monster of a brutal plastic display that carries in itself a message and a search. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Honest, searing and surprisingly modern, it's knocked Mrs Brown off my top spot once and for all.|Fresh
What is new is the amount of emotion and verbal jousting on screen ... this twist in style makes the film at once fresh and familiar.|Fresh
If you're going to say something trite, you could do worse than to say it with as much magnificent panache as Lanthimos has.|Fresh
This internal struggle for power in reality, a game of twisted, capricious and unhappy teenagers for the permanent attention they must put to their machinations. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Favourite is a brilliant dark comedy, shattering notions of aristocratic decency with glee.|Fresh
The Favourite is a fun, juicy twist on an English court drama, and a refreshingly unconventional love triangle.|Fresh
A gorgeous, brutally caustic and frenetic delight, as Sarah Churchill Duchess of Marlborough, Queen Anne and Sarah's impoverished cousin Abigail fight and flatter to be the ultimate woman on top. Weisz, Colman and Stone are riveting.|Fresh
A film that combines a brilliant script with a visionary director and employs the talents from an incredible cast to coalesce into a filmgoing experience I won't soon forget.|Fresh
Everyone is looking out for themselves, and while that ambition helps them on the way up, it also leads to their downfall. Meanwhile, watching The Favourite only has upsides.|Fresh
Provides a lot of sick enjoyment, but like too many of Lanthimos' films the high doesn't last quite long enough.|Fresh
A highly entertaining, intoxicating and nasty escapade that reveals the miserable emptiness of unearned, false power and love.|Fresh
The Favourite delivers a sense of confidence from the very start, as Lanthimos controls the spectator's emotions with a balance of tragedy and wit in this rousing curve of supposed history.|Fresh
The Favourite is fascinating, ferociously funny, and hands down one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
The Favourite is a ridiculously fun film. If you're offended by the C word but dare you miss such brilliant performances from this trio of excellence? On your head be it.|Fresh
The Favourite enjoys being whimsical and allows itself to run wild, but that's also part of its downfall.|Rotten
The Favourite is a complete joy - it offers a space in which women are allowed to control their own fates, to throw themselves into their desires with abandon, and it gives us a plethora of well-polished performances for us to indulge in.|Fresh
in the seesawing emotions of the female-led monarchy, there's a newfound gravity that increases the credibility of Lanthimos' comedy.|Fresh
Supercharged by zesty, pin-sharp dialogue by writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite is a brilliantly barbed character piece as well as a portrait of a historical period both methodically detailed yet ingeniously twisted.|Fresh
The Favourite succeeds in engulfing us in a world of pettiness and extravagance, where cake and power matter more than political strife or human cost.|Fresh
Lanthimos doesn't disappoint.|Fresh
For those unaccustomed to Lanthimos' previous films, this could be the perfect introduction to his work. It's certainly the only one with the potential to be a crowd pleaser.|Fresh
Sharp, filthy and fantastically anarchic, The Favourite is a hilarious and original vision that is an utter delight. The very definition of a must-see.|Fresh
The script is sensational.|Fresh
Underneath the pomp and powdered wigs it makes scathing commentary about the devastating nature of power struggles that remains blisteringly relevant in this Brexit/Trump age.|Fresh
If you're tired of those boring royal British films and want to see the genre turned upside down, this dark, nasty bit of debauchery and revenge sex will leave you gasping for air.|Fresh
The Favourite is something else. The film irreverently flips the genre on its head, offering a pathetic queen, contempt for the strict social mores, and brief departures from the façade of the 1700s.|Fresh
With an infectious sense of humor, some wonderfully captivating performances, and a decidedly deeper takeaway, it is a shining example of a filmmaker at the prime of his art.|Fresh
The Favourite is Lanthimos's most accessible film, shaped by aesthetics but driven by plot and character.|Fresh
I don't think The Favourite will be for everyone. I do think that there's enough in the movie worth of awards consideration and hopefully it will get long-deserved attention for the highly-underrated [Olivia] Colman.|Fresh
"This is the closest thing we'll ever get to a proper ""Alice in Wonderland"" adaptation because everyone's mad here."|Fresh
What [his] tools primarily do is create a fantastic sense of suspense, to have us begging to know how he could possibly wrap it all up. The answer is, he can't, not in a way that satisfies.|Rotten
Swallowing her role whole, Olivia Colman's Queen Anne is a marvelous portrait of a frail, broken woman, with insecurities wearing on every beat and movement of her life.|Fresh
What makes The Favourite work are its women -- who rule, both literally within the movie and outwardly, dominating our enjoyment.|Fresh
In The Favourite, Lanthimos opens up these characters more, yet still keeping the darker aspects of his techniques intact.|Fresh
It resists the urge of fawning reverence and hagiography that so bedevils most productions about British monarchs... and is infused with passion by a triumvirate of tour de force performances.|Fresh
A movie where women hold all the power, and get to revel in some debauchery while pulling the strings, feels like a real treat.|Fresh
Well-executed dark comedy of court intrigue in 18th-century England.|Fresh
No amount of ostentation proves sufficient to spruce up the insipid narrative, which strains to fulfil its two-hour running time as if it were a requirement of seriousness.|Rotten
"Olivia Colman is simply dazzling as a fragile, volatile and sometimes dotty Queen Anne in ""The Favourite,"" a zestful period piece directed by Yorgos Lanthimos."|Fresh
The Favourite is not just one of the best movies of the year, it's the most topical, too, and the most hopeless as a result.|Fresh
The Favourite's biggest revelation may be that Yorgos Lanthimos treats his characters here with a degree of compassion, rather than regard them with his usual smirking indifference.|Fresh
Lanthimos has transferred his own peculiar vision of human oddity into the past, in a way that makes most period drama seem formulaic and inert.|Fresh
I suspect that some scholars on the Royals will take issue ... But Colman's performance is so volcanically great, they may shrug and find themselves giving in to the daffy, fiery vulnerability of her portrayal.|Fresh
The Favourite is a pleasure to watch. It's weird without being alienating, dirty without being cheap. And you'd be hard-pressed to find a better acting trio this fall.|Fresh
Lanthimos snaps out of the mannered sameness that was threatening to suffocate his work.|Fresh
The Favourite is an absolute riot, a scabrous and wickedly enjoyable bodice-ripper that makes the dastardly deeds of Dangerous Liaisons look positively tame.|Fresh
Yorgos Lanthimos's The Favourite is a filthy, violent and outrageous period comedy that drips with bad language and worse behaviour, and will appal anyone who is expecting a more conventional royal drama.|Fresh
Lanthimos has an eye for the grotesque that suits overt comedy even better than it does quirky horror.|Fresh
it's Colman who steals the show. She's ostensibly playing a gout-afflicted monster with capricious instincts and insatiable appetites...and she attacks this side of the role with gusto, shouting, yelping, whimpering and raging with Lear-like abandon.|Fresh
All three members of the main trio are at their best, but it's Colman who most deserves a coronation.|Fresh
Why wasn't everyone applauding every damn second of the extravagantly wonderful, deeply hilarious and fabulously entertaining The Favourite?|Fresh
Wily, warped and ticklish - history viewed through cracked glass.|Fresh
[Yorgos Lanthimos'] idiosyncratic style is an acquired taste that's starting to go stale, and as such this is one of those films that works like a charm in the moment but whose spell quickly wears off.|Fresh
A fantastic little cupcake of a movie laced with thistle frosting.|Fresh
It's a rousingly nasty, bleary, hungover punchup.|Fresh
Lanthimos' disaffected view of human foibles is present in every shot.|Fresh
A wicked delight.|Fresh
It's a perfectly cut diamond of a movie - a finely executed, coldly entertaining entry in the genre of savage misanthropic baroque costume drama.|Fresh
Plays like All About Eve as filtered through The Draughtman's Contract, where everyone from the servants to the queen herself is playing the game and manipulating others to get what they want.|Fresh
The Favourite is a zany, piercing close-up on three women so replete with swagger as to reduce their male counterparts to disposable extras.|Fresh
The Favourite has ribaldry and intelligence to burn, a deliciously entertaining period piece that feels liberated by its period, rather than restrained and invigorates like a glass of wine thrown violently in your face.|Fresh
