The film features an incredible turn by Ethan Hawke, but can't get out of its own way. Ponderous, pretentious, and intentionally unsatisfying, it's a frustrating experience.|Rotten
First Reformed is a brilliant return to form. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A visually and emotionally rigorous experience, but it's also grounded and centered by star Ethan Hawke in a performance that is quietly spectacular in every scene.|Fresh
Brooding in tone and sincerely acted... this is Schrader's best film since Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters and one of 2018's highlights.|Fresh
The writing of First Reformed is audacious. It is unusual - and even complicated - to connect the church or some institution of faith with the thriller. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Add Paul Schrader's latest movie First Reformed to a growing list of modern masterpieces on faith.|Fresh
For a person so extreme, so inactive, so broken, simply asking God for help isn't enough. He writes because he can no longer pray. A commanding performance and a uniquely incredible script.|Fresh
...exactly the kind of discourse American cinema desperately needs.|Fresh
A fantastic depiction of faith under attack by instinct. Dark and dense, First Reformed is a perfect display for Ethan Hawke. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
All this seems to be heading into familiar art film territory, darkness, despair, suicide, violence and existential ennui. On the surface, this is a one-note, drab, downbeat movie, but it is more than that. A lot is going on here.|Fresh

A haunting and meditative work.|Fresh
The movie is filled with conversations that provide something of the satisfaction of sinking into a smart, provocative essay.|Fresh
So many of Paul Schrader's screenplays are debates about belief, but never have they been as starkly free of extraneous concerns as this unexpected late career masterpiece is.|Fresh
The parallels of the destructive natures of polluters are likened to organized religion, as the poison is nearly one and the same.|Fresh
Screenwriter-director Paul Schrader returns to greatness with this lacerating, austere portrait of a crisis of faith.|Fresh
An absolutely compelling portrait of a man of faith immersed in a fugue of existential anguish.|Fresh
... making viewers feel as numb inside as the main character... feels like its missing a necessary point-of-view, leaving all else as an exercise in futility... plus a somewhat-cool one-sheet poster.|Rotten
First Reformed is a mesmermising work of faith and rage...|Fresh
Schrader's portrait of a pastor coming unglued from his faith and corporeal reality features one of the great performances of the century in Ethan Hawke's forlorn Reverend Ernst Toller.|Fresh
A portrait of spiritual agony that veritably quakes with stifled, pleading despair.|Fresh
It's the sight of a filmmaker rediscovering the power their voice has - and using it as a cry for help that we are now too powerless to answer.|Fresh
The film is a cry of rage against the polluters and corrupters who, Schrader contends, are destroying the planet, as well as against the commercialisation of the churches and the growth of terrorism.|Fresh
This formalist approach to the narrative takes a hard right into more stylized imagery in the third act which is as breathtaking as it is surprising.|Fresh
"Engaging from start to finish despite its slow-burn pace, ""First Reformed"" will likely be one of 2018's best independent films with a career-best effort from (Ethan) Hawke."|Fresh
One of the most impactful, poignant, thought-provoking movies about faith ever made.|Fresh
Schrader puts his character on a collision course between the promises of faith and the tragic realities of world in environmental decay.|Fresh
One may interpret the final moments of First Reformed as the despondency of Good Friday or the hope of Easter; in either case, it is holy ground.|Fresh
Just as redemption plays a role in most of Schrader's work, First Reformed offers self-redemption for a master craftsman who delivers on the best films of 2018.|Fresh
Part scathing, part ruminative, part tragic but profoundly affecting, First Reformed is an astonishing piece of cinema.|Fresh
Then again, few people can wear a clerical uniform to great distinction the way Hawke does here, conveying his eventual downfall into ethical submission with utter tranquility.|Fresh
I have no hesitation in calling First Reformed one of Schrader's best films, in what frequently registers as a summation of the writer/director's preoccupations and anxieties.|Fresh
First Reformed is a treatise on remorse, exposed through fixed planes with constant reframing in which frontality predominates. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
With the intensity that's made him such a compelling screen presence for decades now, Hawke wears his character's growing uncertainty and unhappiness like a weathered second skin.|Fresh
First Reformed is not only [Paul Schrader's] best film in a long time... but it's also the closest thing to a box office success Schrader's had since Affliction. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Paul Schrader offers a very personal and, at the same time, universalist, film... that even allows brief moments of ""magical realism"". [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
First Reformed ultimately plays as a personal religious polemic, one steeped in an existential despair over the world and God, that somehow manages to avoid even a remote sense of the spiritual.|Rotten
But for all First Reformed's soundless fury, it's the perforated moments of intimate wonder which gnaw against our subconscious, a divine sweetness blossoming between bruises.|Fresh
First Reformed ends up feeling like a film that needed another draft or two to help iron out the wrinkles in its main character's arc.|Rotten
First Reformed is Paul Schrader's twenty-first film as a director, and probably his best. It seems to sum up a lot of things Schrader believes in, artistically and spiritually.|Fresh
It's a brilliantly conceived trajectory performed with powerful conviction by Hawke. But a little subtlety [from Schrader] would have gone a long way.|Fresh
A bruising experience; one that left even a non-religious person like me feeling shaken.|Fresh
They are weird moments of almost hypnotic transcendence, but at the center of it is that tortured God's lonely man character perfectly embodied by Ethan Hawke.|Fresh
First Reformed is a compelling slow burn.|Fresh
A work that most 30 year old's would welcome, and one that a 71 year old might have thought would never come around again.|Fresh
Beautifully composed, it is a film that reaches well beyond the surface of its story. It is about the very condition and mood of our times, and the palpable sense of some oncoming cataclysm.|Fresh
If Schrader has had to deal with an onslaught of compromised projects over the past two decades, First Reformed is not only the purest distillation of his intentions in quite some time, but also one of his most acutely reserved.|Fresh
It's a thrilling ride, and Ethan Hawke's performance - the best of his career and worthy of an Oscar nomination - never once lets you out of its grip.|Fresh
Mixed in with an outstanding performance from Ethan Hawke, First Reformed is a truly stunning film that can only get better on repeat viewings.|Fresh
This is Hawke's best performance to date and a film that is at the top of my list of the year.|Fresh
While Hawke is excellent, the film's unrelenting bleakness makes for a punishing two hours.|Rotten
"Gripping in its unsentimental clarity of vision, startling in its portentous ruminations on belief, sacrifice, and nature, ""First Reformed"" is unsparing even as it spares, a cinematic jolt of agony and transcendence."|Fresh
The movie ends with a breathtaking scene that feels like an epiphany.|Fresh
The Church of Al Gore gets a surprising close-up in First Reformed.|Fresh
First Reformed manages to sublimely inspire great conviction out of impenetrable darkness.|Fresh
First Reformed is a serious movie that demands serious focus, and in a year where there's such hunger for pop culture that speaks of our times, Paul Schrader may do it better than anyone else.|Fresh
First Reformed is daring and unrelenting-it searches for and pinpoints real harm.|Fresh
You won't see a more textured film this summer.|Fresh
Masterful.|Fresh
Schrader wastes the good work of cinematographer Alexander Dynan - whose framing of every scene is flawlessly precise - and by Hawke, who continues to evolve as an actor in independent productions such as this.|Rotten
Bleak...and slightly barking.|Rotten
The film can't quite summon the anguish to go full Taxi Driver - the conclusion balks right at the edge of the abyss - but Schrader's images have never been crisper, and Hawke is transfixing.|Fresh
Schrader is the divine mortal who wrote Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. He's as passionate as ever; what he has lost is his discipline.|Fresh
Whether art-house, political, or American pop, First Reformed is in between styles in a way that's never satisfactory.|Rotten
First Reformed is [Paul Schrader's] first screenplay to reach the screen unscathed in a decade, and shows an artist strengthened by the fight.|Fresh
This is a film that wrestles with its themes through rigorously crafted dialogue; Schrader sees no benefit in underlining those words with showy camerawork or score, the film-making equivalent of going through the script with a neon highlighter pen.|Fresh
Absorbing, uncomfortable, complex and unapologetically bold in the narrative and spiritual roads it travails.|Fresh
Yet in trying to bring the story to a powerful climax, Schrader lets things get too hectic and surreal, a final psychedelic scene undoing much of the film's hard work.|Rotten
Hawke responds to the demands of the role fearlessly: his is a sombre, powerfully restrained performance, and throughout he wears an expression of clenched gravitas that seems to hold at bay the pain and unrest roiling inside.|Fresh
In Hawke, Schrader has found an actor willing to go the full mile - the presentation of self-violence here is extreme and extraordinary.|Fresh
...a stellar entry within Schrader's admittedly rocky body of work.|Fresh
First Reformed is thought-provoking and one of the best films you will see this year.|Fresh
An eccentric and peculiarly gripping film from veteran director Paul Schrader.|Fresh
The ending will prove divisive but the dialogue sparkles, the atmosphere is brooding and Ethan Hawke chips in with the best performance of his career.|Fresh
But it is, at least, powerfully puzzling and grippingly puzzling. You may not understand it (completely), but you will come away with the feeling that something was being said, whatever that something may have been.|Fresh
Yet ultimately it's so good, and the attention to truthfulness so intense, that Schrader writes himself into a narrative dead end and to a conclusion that bounces, within a few short minutes, from shocking to preposterous to silly to schmaltzy.|Fresh
Shaker furniture in movie form - stark, plain, conceived in austere and intelligent good taste; beautifully made, in fact, but maybe more designed for looking at than actually sitting on.|Fresh
The film is a zinger, with Hawke giving Toller the hungry, doomed conviction of a Graham Greene hero.|Fresh
First Reformed is a tough, masterful movie.|Fresh
First Reformed is not for the faint hearted, but this raw, blistering, bleak and uncompromising drama raises important questions about faith and morality.|Fresh
Schrader's best in yonks, a powerful meditation on faith's place in the modern world. Hawke, as a kind of Travis Bickle in a dog collar, gives one of the performances of the year.|Fresh
Hawke is heart breakingly good in the role of a faltering priest, disillusioned father, and sinner.|Fresh
Is it too early to call this Schrader's masterpiece?|Fresh
Paul Schrader's best for 20 years. A stunning study of one man's flaws and an apocalyptic vision of mankind's fate.|Fresh
The work of a passionate, intelligent and audacious artist who knows exactly what he wants to say and how he wants to say it.|Fresh
Given today's comic-book-driven climate, a picture this profound is honestly a little like a miracle.|Fresh
"""Schrader still doesn't know how to make movies that express belief in a cause, or naturalism, or anything else."""|Rotten
We are treated to long, delicious scenes filled with dialogue that matters, all of it spearheaded by an unwound, infirmed and strangely sexy priest.|Fresh
"""First Reformed,"" is the face of Hawke, which miraculously never gets consumed by the hellfire all around."|Fresh
An austere film-making exercise, wallowing in anguish and despair. There's a reason why it was rejected by both Netflix and Amazon.|Rotten
A rare and intriguing example of theological inquiry in American cinema ... driven by an aching conscience.|Fresh
Bleak, wintry and rigorously controlled.|Fresh
Ethan Hawke brilliantly captures the doubt many believers wrestle with, but the film never seriously engages with the counsel the Bible offers to deal with it.|Rotten
A film that glides on a knife's edge of seemingly unresolvable contradictions.|Fresh
It's a very heady movie. There isn't much to speak of in terms of action. It's Taxi Driver without the taxi: A long ride inside the mind of a man beginning to see the world around him in a whole new and increasingly hostile way.|Fresh
While it invites viewers to ruminate over any number of big ideas, it boasts no crystallizing moment to tie all those ideas together in a satisfying way.|Rotten
What Schrader does best is show his characters inching forward through their flaws and transgressions.|Fresh
Just a strong recommendation and a big thumbs up for Schrader still having so much to say after a recent string of cinematic misfires.|Fresh
"""First Reformed"" captures the despair that good and decent people can feel, looking at a world that seems to have turned its back on goodness and decency."|Fresh
It's worth noting that no scene in First Reformed ever leaves its protagonist, and through his spiraling journal entries and increasingly rash Schrader undermines the old-school Protestantism at its center.|Fresh
First Reformed is Schrader's best film in a long time. It provides an unflinching look at many of life's big questions.|Fresh
"[PODCAST] As Thomas Wolf pointed out in his essay, Christ's primary teaching was that ""loneliness could be destroyed forever by the life of love."" Is ""First Reformed"" a perfect film? Yes, yes it is."|Fresh
First Reformed slowly builds toward an inevitable conclusion, but Schrader confounds those expectations with an ending that will certainly leave you talking. This isn't easy fare, but it's wholly worthwhile.|Fresh
A haunting, strange and lyrical narrative on one man's spiritual and political resurrection from the darkest corners of his consciousness. First Reformed brims with insights on anger, guilt, faith and personal autonomy.|Fresh
The movie loses focus when it most needs it.|Rotten
For Schrader, ideas are paramount, and he packs in plenty, none less profound than the proposition that, to survive, we must hold hope and despair in our minds simultaneously.|Fresh
...sharp, bleak, and oddly oblique...|Fresh
First Reformed is that rare movie that questions faith from the standpoint of faith. Schrader is a believer, one brave enough to question why - or even what - he believes.|Fresh
Despite the provocative imagery and subject matter, First Reformed is a film that revels in its solemnity and speaks with a furious sincerity.|Fresh
First Reformed can hardly imagine a hopeful future for the world, [yet] the film is full of longing for redemption... Toller hopes that his journal is a kind of prayer. Perhaps Schrader hopes the same for his film.|Fresh
An unforgettable powerhouse.|Fresh
It's nice to know that, at 72, Paul Schrader can still surprise.|Fresh
Every moment of First Reformed feels perfectly framed and precisely lit.|Fresh
Ethan Hawke soars in writer/director Schrader's masterful (if very bleak) drama about trampled faith.|Fresh
It is a work that isn't' afraid to look at something most movies try their best to avoid: deep despair.|Fresh
What sets First Reformed apart is Schrader's relentless reserve.|Fresh
Ethan Hawke hauntingly embodies Reverend Toller, a middle-aged pastor at a church whose glory days are long past.|Fresh
The anger in it - the American quality, that refuses to swallow wrath instead of expressing it as violence - gives it a simmer.|Fresh
In its consideration of the commercialization of evangelical Christianity for an audience that has no time for the teachings of Christ, First Reformed's concerns are entirely of the moment.|Fresh
The scenes with Hawke, Cedric, and Gaston are improbably tense, in part because each character is given a rich and forceful voice in a way that has becoming increasingly rare in modern movies.|Fresh
A film that fascinates even as it goes wildly overboard.|Fresh
"A ""Taxi Driver"" for the present day, with Hawke in a career-best performance."|Fresh
"Provocative and mesmerizing, ""First Reformed"" is a film that demands to be seen."|Fresh
This strikingly austere film is a rare movie to meaningfully wrestle with theological concerns-and their application in our ever-more-problematic worldly reality-so you are guaranteed ample discussion fodder afterward.|Fresh
It's Schrader's on-point filmmaking--a nouveau spin on the spiritual films, character studies, and transcendental style of cinematic Old Masters like Bergman and Bresson--that functions as what Toller calls 'another form of prayer.'|Fresh
Hawke masterfully places us inside the head of a man with a disintegrating soul, as he gradually loses a long-running battle with his demons.|Fresh
It lingers uneasily in the subconscious. Furious and darkly funny, it's a tight, explosive encapsulation of our very specific moment in history.|Fresh
Schrader's best screenplay since Taxi Driver.|Fresh
Diary of a Country Priest in New York State. A fine Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried. Ending is a bit off the rails.|Fresh
Paul Schrader updates TAXI DRIVER for a new age, resulting in what could be his defining masterpiece.|Fresh
A masterwork containing a possible career-best performance by Ethan Hawke.|Fresh
Is ambition is encouraging, and its dark musings are certainly provocative.|Fresh
The best praise I can give First Reformed is that it makes powerful people feel uncomfortable.|Fresh
It's a harrowing study of this man's life, portrayed in claustrophobic compositions ... [and] Hawke's precisely tuned performance...|Fresh
First Reformed is something of a resurrection for the 71-year-old filmmaker, and an apt one.|Fresh
A major work by a cinema giant, urgently reckoning with issues both current and eternal.|Fresh
Schrader's brilliant film seamlessly incorporates the personal, the political, and the spiritual into one dynamic and immersive narrative.|Fresh
Schrader pulls no spiritual punches.|Fresh
First Reformed begins to get really interesting when Schrader turns the tables on his hero-and us, and possibly himself.|Fresh
A searing, powerful look at the mingling of faith, politics, and activism|Fresh
"""First Reformed,"" a mesmerizingly austere drama of one man's apocalyptic crisis of faith, feels like the movie Paul Schrader was put on this planet to make."|Fresh
An act of spiritual inquiry, a coolly assured example of cinematic scholarship in subtly deployed motion and one of the strongest pictures of 2018.|Fresh
"""First Reformed"" is an amazing examination of faith, a film that stays with you long after you have left the theater."|Fresh
First Reformed hums disquietingly along at Schrader's own clockwork pace which, like Hawke's mesmerizing performance, is austere, stoic, and ultimately self-destructive. It's a glorious piece of filmmaking...|Fresh
Hawke gives an extraordinarily controlled performance as a man struggling mightily to retain dominion over himself...every minute detail of which speaks to an almost unendurable act of self-regulation.|Fresh
A direct expression from the soul onto celluloid, unvarnished and uncompromised, and Schrader's best film in years.|Fresh
Commandingly demonstrates that [Paul] Schrader is still worth listening to.|Fresh
A masterful portrait of a priest struggling with his inner torments, and the external realities of the church and the world.|Fresh
"""First Reformed"" is Ethan Hawke's film and the actor gives a richly textured performance of a man at an important crossroad in his life."|Fresh
It's a gorgeous film, mourning the impossibility of being alive as it celebrates that which binds us, a conscious-rattling, viscera-stirring piece of art.|Fresh
The diary allows for Toller's narration to feel natural and place us into the mind on the verge of destruction, and the closing moments express the sensation of good and evil; the closing shot alone is worth the price of admission|Fresh
...Hawke delivers what very well may be his career-best performance as Ernst Toller.|Fresh
This scenario is serious almost to the point of silliness: It could be parody of a morality play. But the heaviness is also essential to the architecture and impact of what I'm thinking is the year's first maybe-great American movie.|Fresh
Schrader's film is a wise, shocking, intellectually prodigious masterpiece.|Fresh
There's nothing ambiguous about the strength of Hawke's work or the fact that this is a complete artistic comeback for a writer and director who has always refused easy answers.|Fresh
An embittered look at our world through the eyes of someone who's increasingly horrified to be a part of it, and a film that's one of the most searing experiences of the year.|Fresh
A tremendous character study, and a severe depiction of how guilt and the desire to punish oneself manifest.|Fresh
It's fearless, yet utterly controlled, terribly moving and beautifully terrifying.|Fresh
... an ambitious and sharply written drama that's deliberately paced yet never tedious, bolstered by Hawke's powerfully understated performance.|Fresh
A slow movie classic which explores a rainbow mix of religious and spiritual themes.|Fresh
Hawke offers one of his best performances, a masterful blending of outward stoicism and strong and challenging emotions.|Fresh
Schrader's chief influence here, as in many of his other films, is the great French director Robert Bresson... But Bresson's spare stylistics achieved a sublimity while Schrader's, though intermittently powerful, too often feel schematic.|Fresh
Disturbing images in intense, mature character study.|Fresh
A visionary film about the most urgent question facing humanity: ecological ruin. Schrader has made the greatest American film of the decade.|Fresh
A stunning, enrapturing film, a crowning work by one of the American cinema's most essential artists.|Fresh
First Reformed has its steeple in the clouds and its foundation on solid ground.|Fresh
Schrader is positing that the real world is, and should be, about the life of the mind, the health of the soul-and love. Ultimately, that is where First Reformed ends up, even if it seems to be going everywhere else.|Fresh
What begins as a patient and unvarnished look inside one man's depression escalates into a crazed psychic and spiritual unravelling.|Fresh
...ascetic, poetic, and prophetic.|Fresh
It is an exquisite piece of filmmaking and also a blunt, pulpy instrument, a despairing, fully sustained howl of a movie that is easily this director's finest work in years.|Fresh
Schrader...has made a fine existential-crisis movie. And for all its serious intent, it isn't torture to watch.|Fresh
The filmmaker's return to a somber Bressonian mode will work like catnip on his superfans, especially after Schrader's exploitative 2013 Lindsay Lohan disaster The Canyons (little more than dirty-old-man cinema) and two terrible Nic Cage movies.|Fresh
Ambitious Paul Schrader drama ultimately loses its way.|Rotten
"Mr. Schrader...is 71, and has had a long and varied career, but ""First Reformed"" nonetheless feels like a fresh discovery. More than that: an epiphany."|Fresh
Schrader has made his best film in years with his eco-warrior country priest.|Fresh
Paul Schrader offers one of the year's best movies-a faith-in-crisis powerhouse about a pastor -Ethan Hawke hitting a new career peak-who is politically awakened by an eco-activist and a new kind of love.|Fresh
Could this be Ethan Hawke's Oscar?|Fresh
Not an easy watch, but required viewing for ambitious cinephiles.|Fresh
The first two-thirds of this film are utterly riveting... but in the final act... the story threatens to devolve into some sort of eco-thriller.|Fresh
A fascinating work of almost mixed media: Ingmar Bergman and Robert Bresson meet outraged editorial cartooning meet the it-always-builds-to-violence pulp sensibility of the movie brats.|Fresh
"""First Reformed"" is the kind of film that will stay with you long after the credits."|Fresh
It's an exacting film, substantial and suspenseful, one of the best of the year so far.|Fresh
The searching loss-of-faith drama First Reformed is the happy result of Paul Schrader's entering the what-the-hell-let's-go-for-it stage of his long and bravely self-lacerating career.|Fresh
A dazzling exploration of the soul of a reverend overwhelmed by his guilt over the death of his son in Iraq.|Fresh
Until I saw Toller, I didn't know the human soul could frown.|Fresh
After more than 20 features, Paul Schrader has been reborn with First Reformed, an unhurried, furious, deeply agonized look at faith and skepticism that's as reverent as it is blasphemous.|Fresh
Shot in 1.37:1 aspect ratio, and devoid of a conventional musical score, it's an austere examination of devotion, grief, self-loathing and the desperate madness those emotions can inspire in an alienated individual's heart.|Fresh
First Reformed is a carefully composed and constructed film that should probably be seen more than once, with cinematic rewards aplenty for those open to the Word of Schrader.|Fresh
Singular in its distillation of Schrader's decades-spanning preoccupations of film criticism and filmmaking as well as his religious background, First Reformed is a rare object unified in subject and style.|Fresh
A trio of staggering performances by Hawke, Seyfried, and Cedric the Entertainer, a gripping story that mines our current sociopolitical landscape for philosophical fodder, and typically formidable writing make First Reformed a mandatory watch.|Fresh
Engrossing thriller over the loss of faith.|Fresh
First Reformed is an art movie, pure and simple. It won't attract the teenage action-loving crowd. It won't break any box-office records. But it's beautiful, thoughtful and full of grace.|Fresh
In First Reformed, depression arises from one's lack of impact, whether that be through inactivity or a lack of tangible results.|Fresh
A culmination of Schrader's entire career.|Fresh
A great work by a great artist doing things that great art should do - making us think, feel and reflect.|Fresh
First Reformed is a fierce and gratifying modern parable that only someone with the religious and philosophical import like Schrader could pull off.|Fresh
I have been waiting most of my adult life for Paul Schrader to direct a great film.|Fresh
Unique in contemporary cinema, it's a film that takes religion and scripture seriously, and because it does, it must go to the very dark place it eventually goes.|Fresh
Paul Schrader has made his masterpiece.|Fresh
A truly captivating, pertinent piece of cinema.|Fresh
Four decades later, First Reformed may be the full realization of Schrader's vision.|Fresh
A stealthily engrossing work that should appeal to viewers who haven't seen, say, Affliction.|Fresh
Quieter and more sensitive than anything else Schrader has directed, with Ethan Hawke giving one of his finest and most moving performances in the lead role.|Fresh
What keeps us alert as viewers is not the slow disintegration of this man's faith, but the deep ambiguity about where the film's sympathies actually lie.|Fresh
A film of fascinating conversations, anchored by Hawke's completely genuine performance.|Fresh
Greatness is often intertwined with insanity, and there's no way to describe the finale of First Reformed as anything other than a dual act of extreme devotion and inspired lunacy.|Fresh
"Thoughtful, moving, overreaching and uncompromising, ""First Reformed"" is a tremendously tormented work. Ethan Hawke delivers a performance full of grace and sorrow in this powerful portrait of existential and spiritual despair."|Fresh
[Ethan] Hawke's performance is his most mature to date, a masterpiece of a man who cannot work himself out and yet is compelled to try.|Fresh
Schrader and his cast commit to the project with sharpened and unblinking seriousness, even when the going gets mesmerically weird, with violence, visions, levitations and Neil Young protest songs chanted sombrely by toxic swamps.|Fresh
"""First Reformed"" sees Paul Schrader return to his roots, and through the aesthetics of grace, find his way home."|Fresh
A fascinating meditation on inner turmoil in which doing the right thing can lead down many wrong directions.|Fresh
The sort of stimulating work that a writer-director of a certain age can deliver when he returns to his creative sweet spot; rejoice, Schrader fans, rejoice.|Fresh
There's not quite enough oomph or style in the filmmaking to make you forget about the schematic nature of the dramatic construct.|Rotten
First Reformed is a deeply felt, deeply thought picture; impressive in its seriousness and often gripping in the way it frames itself as a debate and a sermon.|Fresh
"In ""First Reformed,"" Paul Schrader courts respectability and leaves it in the dust, getting stoned on excess. But make no mistake: He's still one hell of a filmmaker."|Fresh
