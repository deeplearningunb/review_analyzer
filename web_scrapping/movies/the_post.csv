Spielberg has assembled the best cast that gives us a spectacular film that reminds us to fight for the rights we've been given, particularly the freedom of the press.|Fresh
(The Post) is a good, not great journalism movie rushed to screens across the country to prove a political point.|Fresh
A respectful and respectable feature if one that inspires little more than passing admiration.|Fresh
The Post is a good movie; not spectacular, not great, but good.|Fresh
The Post wants to make sure viewers confront its themes directly and explicitly rather than allow the subtlety of the progressing narrative to seep into them.|Fresh
Sure, The Post is blunt in its messaging and of course contains that Spielberg sentimentality, but it's a vital work that deserves to be seen far and wide in these times of political volatility and a financially struggling press.|Fresh
Makes sure its unashamedly idealised points about freedom of the press and political culpability stand loud, proud and are as timely now as they were back then.|Fresh
Call it a tonic for the times, if you will. I think it's needed, and Spielberg was the right guy to give it to us.|Fresh
Streep and Hanks, who have surprisingly never worked together before, have seamless chemistry that drives The Post toward its crowd-pleasing conclusion.|Fresh
"Spielberg can't help but turn this into a ""message movie,"" and, occasionally, that can feel a little heavy-handed. But it's a message we need loud and clear right now."|Fresh
A great movie with a fantastic message that people should be paying attention to.|Fresh
The Post bills itself as a feminist movie, but it's portrayal of female empowerment is remarkably dated.|Fresh
If you are looking for a story of a woman's awakening to her own strength, a story of earned mutual respect, or a story about a victory of truth over propaganda, The Post is the New Year's gift for you.|Fresh
[Liz] Hannah has really crafted a story of Graham's strength to show the world (and herself) what a woman can accomplish.|Fresh
The greatest strength contained within The Post is the fact that it refuses to grab a pulpit and preach to the choir.|Fresh
It's a lot to tackle, but naturally, Spielberg has it all well in hand and he doesn't limit his spectacular casting to Streep and Hanks.|Fresh
"The ""cred"" of , The Post  is upped even more by ... Hanks and Streep. This is a good movie, no ifs... ands... or buts about it. ."|Fresh
It wouldn't be Spielberg without romanticism to the highest degree, and he'd probably plead guilty.|Fresh
Hanks is fantastic, Streep is stupendous, and Spielberg's direction is masterful.|Fresh
It is a timely message indeed.|Fresh
Timely, both in its defense of freedom of the press and its emphasis on the contribution of female leadership, and while it is a by-the-book kind of treatment of the story, it is still quite a story.|Fresh
The Post's central message is beware of fake news. Ultimately, Spielberg does achieve what he set out to do and that's to provoke critical thinking - what is truth and what is fake.|Fresh
Steven Spielberg's rousing and spirited portrait of integrity as resistance still finds time to revel in the excitement of history unfolding.|Fresh

"The message was meant to remind us all: the press is meant to ""serve the governed, not the governors."" And to that end, The Post is wonderfully successful."|Fresh
...essentially functions as rousing tribute to clear-eyed, ethical journalism - quite the jarring anomaly in a time when even the most irreproachable reporting is frequently and publicly dismissed as corrupt, biased, and broken.|Fresh
If you're unfamiliar with the story of the press blowing the lid off the Vietnam War cover-up, it's worth a watch; if you are familiar, this is the dramatized reenactment with prettier people.|Fresh
The Post tells an urgent story interestingly and well, and if you're a fan of movies, it's hard to imagine it will disappoint.|Fresh
Firing on all cylinders, Streep and Hanks anchor the terrific cast with earthy, detailed performances.|Fresh
Hanks is marvellous as Bradlee, all guts and glory, but it is Streep who, without fuss and with grace, steals the show.|Fresh
Here is a movie that is important for all the reasons you've undoubtedly heard about but is also something few of us could have expected: genuinely exciting.|Fresh
Too much of a slam dunk for Streep and Hanks, this fabled newspaper story is headed for the B section.|Rotten
Democracy dies in darkness, sure, but if Spielberg really wanted to make a movie about the fate of journalism in America, he should have made one about the founding of USA Today in 1982.|Rotten
Spielberg feels like he's just passing through, managing the setups, giving a few notes to the actors, then leaving the rest to the crew while he goes to supervise the edit of Ready Player One.|Rotten

This film will be a reminder of the time Spielberg, Streep and Hanks worked together and as such, will be remembered as a novelty, as opposed to an example of their best work.|Fresh
The Post has a great deal to say about the worth of journalism, but it indulges in a lot of empty cheerleading that casts aside our deepest current dilemmas, even if it proves Spielberg's stylistic skill once again.|Fresh
It is worth going, rather, to see the work of a magisterial director, capable of making an exciting sequence up to the printing of a newspaper. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

A cloying concluding affirmation will curl some toes, but The Post is nonetheless a heart-on-its-sleeve feature which, though preaching to the converted who will see it, is a rousing championing of the power and importance of the media.|Fresh
It's clear there is nothing brave about making a film about events from the past that are a bit like now. It is cosy cinema for gentle head shaking. As effective, politically, as leafleting for Hillary Clinton in Williamsburg.|Rotten
Aside from its timeliness, Spielberg's opus on the Freedom of the Press is also an effective narrative on female empowerment anchored by a contemplative performance by living legend Meryl Streep.|Fresh
The film wrings a fair amount of tension and nostalgia from what is essentially a string of meetings in smoky rooms, though it stints on analysis and ends with a limp punchline.|Fresh
The Post is a reminder that quality journalism should still be cherished and championed.|Fresh

A good film with great things in it.|Fresh
It couldn't be more relevant in our era of spin doctors, fake news and cyber attacks.|Fresh
Though the film depicts events from 46 years ago, the resonance of the message about the importance of press freedom couldn't be clearer.|Fresh
As an educational piece, I actually really did enjoy this movie and the performances were top-notch.|Fresh

It is getting overpraised because it seems to be in touch with the current revulsion towards more current government lies. Adequate at best, this represents a missed opportunity.|Fresh
It's a bit of a Trojan horse, as it cleverly smuggles in another film; a film about a woman coming into her own, which has to be satisfying. And is.|Fresh
The Post is a smart, astute piece of cinema that entertains in spades while still having plenty to say on a political, social and journalistic level. It is a film worthy of the heavyweight talent it has attracted.|Fresh
Despite it all, Streep and Hanks soldier on, as only they can, and they do convince us that this fight matters. But The Post feels like old news.|Fresh
This welcome paean to print is glorious broadsheet filmmaking.|Fresh
Years from now, away from its current relevance, The Post will play like a sedate prequel to All the President's Men.|Fresh
Graham, who inherited the job after her husband's suicide, grows in stature - from reluctant boss shouted down by male subordinates to a more confident leader - and is fascinating to watch, thanks in large part to Streep's sensitive portrayal.|Fresh

Streep, Hanks and Spielberg deliver quality news in this journalistic thriller that's out to be this year's Spotlight.|Fresh
Despite going a bit soft at the end, The Post does function well enough, even if it is preaching very much to the choir.|Fresh
Spielberg's latest works as entertainment, but he not so secretly wants the audience to run from the theaters and donate to the ACLU.|Fresh
Naturally, and unsurprisingly, Hanks and Streep are at the very top of their game, and the film benefits greatly as a result..|Fresh
No one alive is better at conveying what makes America uniquely great, or at getting an audience to believe that everything will be OK if we just do what we know is right.|Fresh
A timely look at a fight to be heard - in the boardroom or the press - that's elegant without being electric.|Fresh
When The Post moves into its final act, Spielberg cranks up the tension magnificently and there are flourishes enough, even if the pay-off feels cringingly feel-good and then strangely flat.|Fresh
Spielberg's work is an expository blast of energy, a vital, vibrant and often humorous dramatization of the journalistic process.|Fresh
"This is a powerful if sometimes heavy-handed film. It seems particularly significant right now, when there's an orange buffoon tweeting about awarding ""worst news"" awards as a propaganda tool to stifle criticism."|Fresh
The balance doesn't sit right and the most exciting elements of The Post remain off-screen. The film has measured surface and technical values, though there is little flair in Janusz Kaminski's cinematography and its texture feels cold and clinical.|Rotten
An evenhanded snapshot of the fractious relationship between a deceitful government and committed journalists, The Post is essential viewing.|Fresh
The conversations that centre on this point are at the heart of the film, which is timely, timeless and utterly enthralling.|Fresh
The Post is an expertly-crafted and compelling film brought to tantalizing life by a master director and an all-star ensemble cast.|Fresh
The Post goes beyond chastising clickbaity media sensationalism and serves as a stark reminder of the purpose of the press in any democracy.|Fresh
It is interesting that the film so beautifully intersects with the current cultural moment, from the attacks on free speech, to women asserting their power and stepping up.|Fresh
The result is such a nostalgic, romantic view of the newspaper business that it makes you wonder where the love for newspapers has gone all these years later.|Fresh
It's the first time [Hanks] and Ms. Streep have appeared together, and you won't find a better match than these two old pros, who are in the business of complementing, not competing with, each other.|Fresh
You wouldn't expect a movie that relies on pay phones, typewriters and Linotyp to be the timeliest entry of the awards season.|Fresh
The Post stands as a tribute to Spielberg's skill as a storyteller, imbuing his backroom story with generous suspense and tension without needing the spectacular action scenes of so many of his celebrated past films.|Fresh
The Post lacks the mythic poetry of Lincoln or the freightedness of Munich,and it won't wear as well as Spielberg's absolute best work, but it's supremely entertaining and well-realized.|Fresh
It's to Spielberg's credit that he wanted to tell this story, and that he and his formidable cast tell it so very well.|Fresh
If only there were an Oscar for inanimate objects. The Post would be loading a wheelbarrow full of hardware home on awards night for Meryl Streep's spectacles and an old Xerox machine... Sadly, the emphasis is on the artifacts, not the emotional drama.|Fresh
Spielberg's timing is nearly perfect, and so is his film.|Fresh
It may be set in the past, but The Post is a timely and urgent tale for the present.|Fresh
Here, from the most capable hands, is a very good movie showing you how the events in that one came to be.|Fresh
As someone who lived through this crisis while it played out in reality, I am surprised at how suspenseful 'The Post' was for me to watch.|Fresh
Spectacularly entertaining, in the way that Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws are spectacularly entertaining. Breathlessly paced, it's a journalist-movie thrill ride ... There is no reason not to see it. It is professional, angry, and fun.|Fresh
As good as it should be|Fresh
"Even though the themes are weighty and the parallels are provocative, my takeaway resembled what Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) growls at one point in the newsroom: ""My God, the fun."""|Fresh
Streep is particularly good as the embodiment of a woman who never expected to be running a newspaper (she was thrust into that role following the suicide of her husband) but who rose to the occasion ...|Fresh
Steven Spielberg can do anything ... except change a culture where Fake News has turned journalism into an eye sore.|Fresh
The Post is a brave movie - perhaps even braver than its biggest inspiration, All the President's Men.|Fresh
Historical irony, no matter how relevant, means little to movie-goers if a film isn't well told and well executed. And few filmmakers tell and direct a story better than Spielberg.|Fresh
[Meryl] Streep doesn't play her as a crusader; twice Kay walks into boardrooms, a lone woman among grim men, making no impression.|Rotten
[Spielberg] has misjudged the effect of his sermon, and has the wrong idea about what we need now. The choir is preached to; those deaf to such matters will continue to ignore. Such a feeble cry of outrage isn't really relevant at all.|Rotten
More timely than good, The Post comes at a moment when Americans appear to have forgotten their own mission statement, at least in terms long put forward by an independent press.|Fresh
"... Plays as a thriller, even though the ""action"" consists only of people reading, talking and typing."|Fresh
Yes, it's big and glossy, with big glossy stars and a big glossy director. But it has the fierce heart of a battling indie picture, one that demands we look at what's been right in front of us for decades, but, perhaps, some of us didn't want to see.|Fresh
The Post deals with weighty issues about government cover-ups and freedom of the press. But don't be scared off if you're afraid it's one big history lesson. This drama from Steven Spielberg is also a lot of fun.|Fresh
The subtle jockeying by all three becomes a most civil parlor game, telling of an era when media were far too cozy with their subjects to justifiably claim objectivity.|Fresh
If pure cinematic pedigree counts for anything these days, then The Post just has to be the best-bred movie to happen along in a long time.|Fresh
The Post is a timely, extraordinarily well-made and probably quite necessary film.|Fresh
I can't imagine anyone who ever has worked at a newspaper not giving a big thumbs up to The Post.|Fresh
The message was perhaps better served in a whisper, instead of with a megaphone.|Rotten
While the movie is certainly worth seeing, it's nevertheless a disappointment, given the cast and crew's impressive pedigree.|Fresh
"Steven Spielberg's new film about how the Washington Post handled the publishing of the so-called ""Pentagon papers"" in 1971 is not only educational and informative but also entertaining and terribly timely."|Fresh
The Post move(s) from a crackling newsroom yarn to a showcase for Streep's now-expected brilliance. It's become routine to see her perform flawlessly, but here she quietly gives one of her best, and most perfectly calibrated, performances.|Fresh
It's not a civics lesson, it's entertaining throughout.|Fresh
The main reason to see The Post isn't political. It's Streep. She gives one of the best performances of her career, and certainly the best in recent years.|Fresh
The Post is a decent movie. That's its curse.|Rotten
"Ultimately, ""The Post"" is about abuse of power at the highest levels and accountability, which couldn't be more timely."|Fresh
However, The Post is undeniably an important movie for our times, a product shaped by the present and past, and speaking compellingly to this singular moment in our American history.|Fresh
"How you'll feel about The Post is more or less preordained by how you feel about Hollywood, Spielberg, the yearly tradition of Oscar bait, and the boogeyman of a ""liberal media""..."|Fresh
Molds real life into a crowd-pleasing story without sacrificing the underlying honesty.|Fresh
- a potent, important story & Steven Spielberg has pieced together all the elements....If I have a quibble, it is how the dramatic arc is handled: the film delivers bombshells, yet we hardly feel the blast.|Fresh
"""The Post"" is not Steven Spielberg's best film to date but it is a solidly constructed historical drama about a real-life event in the battle for freedom of the press and speech."|Fresh
Meticulously crafted, perfectly paced and brilliantly acted, the only thing that lets this terrific 1970s-set thriller down is too many ideas.|Fresh
In a lot of ways, The Post is the movie Oliver Stone wanted Snowden to be.|Fresh
Spielberg demonstrates marvelous skill as he follows through on the story's journalistic, legal, political, and economic consequences.|Fresh
Still, it's to his credit that Spielberg fleshes out what the revelations of these papers meant for the US at the time.|Fresh
This has very strong work from Streep and Hanks alongside a large cast.|Fresh
The cinematic takeaway here is a combination of the factual story, the superb supporting cast (Sarah Paulsen, Bob Odenkirk, Carrie Coon, and Tracy Letts among them), and the film's powerhouse leads, Streep and Hanks.|Fresh
Spielberg's rush job about the role of journalism is diminished by dot connecting, historical liberty-taking and a cloying sense of self-congratulation. Instead of an incisive comment on our strange American moment, The Post is, in the end, old news.|Rotten
It's a sentimental, hagiographic history lesson ... but [moviegoers] would do well to studyhow the electricity intensifies, scene by scene, in a way we rarely experience.|Fresh
"The stars align, in more ways than one, as Nixon's seething contempt for the press finds relevance in today's attacks by the current president on the mainstream media as ""fake news."""|Fresh
It is the greatest newspaper movie since All the President's Men, the best film about journalism since 1987's Broadcast News and Spielberg's finest since Saving Private Ryan two decades ago.|Fresh
"""The Post"" is the right movie at the right time."|Fresh
Streep manages to thrill us with mere words. And it doesn't hurt to see a strong woman stand up to a room full of condescending white men.|Fresh
The Post is an important film spotlighting the necessity of a free press to keep our government in check, but more importantly, spotlights a person...a woman willing to risk everything for the greater good of the nation.|Fresh
A watchable, if not enthralling, account of important events, and some notions that are perhaps more important today than they even were forty-something years ago.|Fresh
This is movie for its time, one that -- armed with an Oscar-rich cast and crew -- manages to deliver its messages without climbing onto a soapbox and lecturing.|Fresh
The heroic journalism depicted in The Post could hardly be more timely, it's true, but Spielberg's take rarely achieves dramatic traction.|Rotten
The roll-up-the-sleeves-and-dig-in attitude is a joy to watch; the multitude of self-righteous monologues are anything but.|Rotten
The Post is the filmic equivalent of your mom's mashed potatoes: you know they're good; you can depend on them, but there's better out there.|Rotten
Streep is at the very top of her game here, a wealthy society woman loyal to friends and the family business who finds the gumption to jeopardize both to become a formidable publisher.|Fresh
Streep is magnificent, and when it comes time to compile her legacy, this performance, one full of fear, confidence, verve and doubt, will rank among her best.|Fresh
It's exciting and essential, and one of my favorite films of 2017.|Fresh
A Spielberg classic. Streep and Hanks superb. This is why newspapers matter.|Fresh
Spielberg offers a tight, lucid and highly satisfying account of the Pentagon Papers from the point of view of the Post and its publisher, Kay Graham.|Fresh
[A] streamlined account of history, invested in the daily workings of a newspaper and anchored by a genuine sense of idealism.|Fresh
Old-school filmmaking at its most robust and rousing.|Fresh
Watching Streep and Hanks hash out what they're going to do is so entertaining it's a wonder it's not illegal; how have these two never shared the screen before?|Fresh
The standout is Bob Odenkirk as Ben Bagdikian, the kind of old-school reporter who wears out the soles of his shoes tracking down a scoop.|Fresh
To its credit, the film is nostalgic for journalistic responsibility-the antithesis of the scares, half-truths and conjecture on internet news.|Fresh
It's a great watch.|Fresh
Most of the fault lies with writers Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, neither of whom have major credits on their resumé. But it doesn't help that Spielberg is a true believer in America and everything he thinks it stands for.|Rotten
"Even that favourite visual cliche of the newspaper movie, the collage of rolling presses and papers hitting the street, is edited with a fresh ferocity, as ""hot lead"" type seems to be forged into word bullets for battle."|Fresh
It's breathless, a little goofy and an altogether grand old time at the movies.|Fresh
This is a story about taking risks, about putting the good of the country before your own. It sounds corny and clichéd, but even in Spielberg's hands it doesn't come off that way.|Fresh
A blunt reminder that everything in this story concerning a craven, paranoid president's loathing of an aggressive free press did not exactly vanish with the Nixon administration.|Fresh
If the intention was to send audiences out feeling inspired about journalism and its function in a republic, consider that mission accomplished.|Fresh
"This is Spielberg back in ""Lincoln"" territory, making historical figures more mythic by making them seem more human."|Fresh
It's nimble, crisp, passionate, full of verve and invention. Put another way: It's a newspaper movie that feels like something made by hustling professionals. On deadline.|Fresh
"""The Post"" tells of a great moment in journalism - and a great moment in one remarkable woman's life."|Fresh
Though director Steven Spielberg gets most of the newspaper stuff right, some clunkiness remains, including Tom Hanks' shaky performance as executive editor Ben Bradlee.|Fresh
Disappointingly flat almost from start to finish...|Fresh
I think Spielberg made The Post as a rallying cry and cautionary tale for the present...The Post plays like a classic Hollywood movie, in the best sense.|Fresh
"Yes, The Post is virtually pre-stamped ""Reliably Entertaining"" and ""Certifiably Uplifting,"" but it makes good on its glossy packaging."|Fresh
Spielberg, now 70, rammed this production through in record time and directs The Post with the enthusiasm of an artist half his age.|Fresh
It's a story worth retelling every few years, lest we forget.|Fresh
At once a gripping fact-based period newspaper drama and a timely tale of female empowerment in a male-dominated world.|Fresh
Inquisitive press pitted against an overreaching executive branch with present-day concerns... banter and grown-up turns akin to the best of the late Nora Ephron. The details of a 1970s newsroom and pressroom are elemental tactile poetry.|Fresh
