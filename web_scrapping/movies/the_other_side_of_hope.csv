If one were to make a comedy about the Syrian refugee crisis, one might need to have a suitably dark and droll sense of humor.|Fresh
It's ridiculous and sympathetic at the same time - compelling filmmaking.|Fresh
This bond forged by shared ambitions is vitally important, because through it the film refuses to demonize or stigmatize Khaled or his liminal position.|Fresh
The director's seamless politics and rock 'n' roll style have been evolved in the past decade, and The Other Side of Hope feels like a crystallization of sorts. It finds the perfect harmony between off-kilter strangeness and essential acts of humanity.|Fresh

[There] is not a false note in the film's humanity, despite a reality that at times seems entirely cinematic.|Fresh

Admirers of the director's work will embrace his famously deadpan style, minimalist sense of humour, static camera and grimy production design...a (relatively) minor Kaurismaki film is still head and shoulders over much of today's cinema.|Fresh
A minor but endearing work of the master Kaurismki. (Complete review in Spanish in Reforma newspaper)|Fresh
Kaurismki pulls it off with a firm but almost invisible hand to spin the story... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

"""The Other Side of Hope"" tackles major problems and themes of our time with a wicked sense of humor."|Fresh
...those who love good movies should not miss this. Applause for Kaurismaki! [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's an odd movie, for sure, but that's Kaurismki for you. Sui generis, he imbues every frame of the film with his own particular quirky sensibility.|Fresh
The film's sharp-contrast lighting (another recurring [Aki] Kaurismki touch) renders everything a little unreal and made-up, ironically softening the harsher edges of Kaurismki's humanistic lessons in kindness.|Fresh
In short, The Other Side of Hope is disappointing... [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Kaurismki has often displayed compassion for the dispossessed... But here, he brings a torn-from-the-headlines immediacy to Khaled's tale.|Fresh
Although Kaurismki might be accused of confusing passion with sentimentality, thereby avoiding it like the plague, the result is a unique movie on an urgent topic told without urgency.|Fresh
... manages to hit raw nerves on the refugee crisis in northern Europe while poking fun at Scandinavian reserve.|Fresh
Credit Kaurismaki with dredging compassion and even a bit of heroism from places where we least expect to find it and from people who, at first blush, don't seem capable of breaking through their isolation.|Fresh
Kaurismaki places his hope in individuals, his sad but tender story making a modest and much-needed case for the value of simple human kindness.|Fresh
... the movie succeeds as a non-preachy comment on how governments fail to provide refugees with needed assistance and it embraces human goodness and common humanity in a world where anybody could become a refugee.|Fresh
[Kaurismaki's] first film in some six years, The Other Side of Hope is, happily, more of the same, but with some themes relevant to today's confused world.|Fresh
The Other Side of Hope is a sweet story, though occasionally lacking in subtlety; Kaurismki seems worried we might side with the skinheads, and goes out of his way to make Khaled sympathetic in almost every respect.|Fresh
The Other Side of Hope is less biting than the director's other recent films (Le Havre, The Man Without a Past) but the droll humanity his work occupies always feels worth revisiting.|Fresh
Aside from the roving Nazi gangs and officious bureaucrats, Helsinki is an otherwise pleasant place where rockabilly music is never too far off, and the director's humanism shines through.|Fresh
The deadpan irony and seemingly dispassionate air of Finnish director Aki Kaurismki's movies certainly aren't for everyone, but they are a taste worth acquiring.|Fresh
[Kaurismki's] pessimism, always mercurial, seems to have mellowed, and that makes this film both more pleasing and less powerful.|Fresh
Kaurismaki's droll comic style remains his trademark. With the possible exception of fellow absurdist Roy Andersson, nobody's movies have quite the same rigorous diorama detachment.|Fresh
a film that is food for the soul|Fresh
. The filmmaker's deep sense of humor and love of the absurd shines through the drama|Fresh
Despite its serious subject - the refugee crisis hitting Europe - The Other Side of Hope is also very funny, never losing sight of the droll, comic upside to life, but never making light of tragedy, either.|Fresh
"Too sentimental and not absurd enough in addressing its hot-button subject, this is no ""Leningrad Cowboys""."|Rotten
The movie expands upon Kaurismki's central mode of observation and delivers some trenchant, upsetting truths about the immigration experience from the side of those seeking asylum.|Fresh
Kaurismaki continues to make the case for immigrants using his characteristically deadpan humor. Superb.|Fresh
Kaurismaki unashamedly believes in brotherhood, and among other things his film celebrates people who do the right thing without making a big deal about it.|Fresh
The filmmaker's universe is both deeply ordinary and just a little uncanny.|Fresh
It's at once honest and artful, a touching and clearsighted declaration of faith in people and in movies.|Fresh
As quirky as it is charming.|Fresh
Running gags about oddball twists in the restaurant business serve little purpose but don't detract from the movie's essential quasi-documentary power.|Fresh
For all its quirky touches, the narrative doesn't spare its ire when it comes to the plight of refugees and the treatment many endure. This is a film bursting with humanity.|Fresh
The Other Side of Hope proves to be one of the Finnish veteran's most impressive balancing acts, a tragicomedy that feels urgent and yet manages to never lose sight of life's inherent ironies.|Fresh
Kaurismki's unworldly drollery ... feels like it's from another time-until it's ruptured by the shocking contemporaneity of the global refugee crisis against which the movie is set.|Fresh
It's all very silly, in the face of the Syrian horrors and European brutalities that Kaurismki takes pains to acknowledge. To these, he can counterpose only kindness, community, humor, and art.|Fresh
As an antidote to cynicism and the toxic wave of nationalism that sweeps across the European metropolis, Kaurismki creates a film balm that is easily identifiable and true to its style... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Finnish director Aki Kaurismki delivers his timeliest and most heartfelt film, mixing humor, pathos, and anger.|Fresh
The Other Side of Hope is a comically dark look at countries handling and views of Syrian Refugees.|Fresh
Kaurismaki's offbeat imagination and subversive charm remain in evidence here. But that irreverent stylistic mix with serious and heart wrenching issues surrounding the current refugee crisis in Europe, lends a perplexing, missed opportunity to this film.|Rotten
A marvellously understated take on Europe's migrant crisis, with two men searching for safe harbours in their lives.|Fresh
The Other Side of Hope fulfills the vague sense of its aspirational title as a film limited in scope and led only by the guidance of its maker's skeptical positivity.|Rotten
While Kaurismaki's deadpan sense of humor remains, his humanist side feels more prominent than ever before.|Fresh
The Other Side Of Hope is just as warm and thoughtful as the rest of [Aki] Kaurismki's body of work, and you might just feel a stab of regret that this story still needs telling.|Fresh
Kaurismki ... remains committed to dinge, tunelessly drowsy twang-rock, and self-plagiarizing shaggy-dog plots.|Fresh
Arguably the most crowd pleasing, least pessimistic of Kaurismki's works, The Other Side of Hope neglects to explore the refugee crisis that gives it a contemporary relevance.|Rotten
The Other Side of Hope gets by on the simple pleasures unique to Kaurismki's oeuvre.|Fresh
A poignant, deeply human film that artfully blends sadness and comedy.|Fresh
It's rare that a movie that is concerned with issues currently in the headlines is more than that, but Aki Kaurismaki's touching and funny The Other Side of Hope, which focuses on the migrant crisis in Europe, pulls it off.|Fresh
"Aki Kaurismki's ""The Other Side of Hope"" is the kind of film about asylum seekers that one imagines Rainer Werner Fassbinder would have made."|Fresh
The urgent subject matter lends weight to a lovely-looking, slow-cooked confection.|Fresh
The Other Side of Hope is a delicate balancing act that engages with the optimism deep within all of our souls, and it satisfies at a primal level.|Fresh
The Other Side of Hope is a film full of playful asides and moving moments, outbursts of music, joy and despair.|Fresh
A very believable work, it offers humour and violence, while the closing scene stirs up a range of emotions few directors can manage.|Fresh
The film resists platitudes about immigration, aiming for something closer to tragicomic realism.|Fresh
It takes real skill to make a film about a desperate Syrian refugee and a dour middle-aged Finn reinventing himself and turn it into the warmest, most life-enhancing film I've seen this year.|Fresh
A movie about the important subject of Syrian refugees that subsumes every idea, theme and argument under Kaurismki's penchant for expressionless actors who smoke a lot and stare into camera while not saying much at all.|Rotten
Very funny in places and looking an absolute treat, The Other Side Of Hope questions our attitudes to refugees, salutes the kindness of strangers and becomes an ode to the power of compassion to change all our lives.|Fresh
It is the latest film from Aki Kaurismki, and fans will be glad to know he's doing what he does best: lugubrious, parched-dry deadpan, pitched with deceptive economy and masterly minimalism.|Fresh
The two characters' stories converge in hilarious ways, but it's the empathy the film generates - accomplished without speechifying or sentimentality - that lingers longest.|Fresh
Maverick as ever but fully engaged with the modern world, Kaurismki dials back his trademark absurdism with a wry allegory of human struggle, empathy and connection.|Fresh
It works, it charms, it often entrances; even when some of the subject matter - here the world refugee crisis - tests the envelope of Kaurismaki's wilful parochialism.|Fresh
Amidst the laughs, of which there are many, comes a profound, pertinent tale surrounding the Syrian refugee crisis.|Fresh
[Kaurismaki's] new feature The Other Side Of Hope is a typically deadpan and brilliantly observed comic study of the plight of a fictional asylum seeker in Finland.|Fresh
A deeply humane film, as well as a quietly hilarious one.|Fresh
The second in his planned 'ports' trilogy has all the Kaurismki hallmarks we have come to know and love, from the lugubrious, deadpan humour to the rumbustious rockabilly music choices and the tenderhearted displays of hard-won emotions.|Fresh
Hope bares all Kaurismki's trademark fingerprints: a vintage colour palette; a technophobic 21st century setting; deadpan humour; still, single-shot scenes.|Fresh
An intricately composed portrait brimming with melancholy, sincerity and worldwide relevance.|Fresh
Kaurismki's warmhearted but unsentimental humanism is such that he recognizes the capability of hardhearted souls making magnanimous gestures to their fellow man.|Fresh
Watching these players try to out-deadpan each other, almost to out-Kaurismki each other, as preposterous flukes wipe them out is every bit as addictive as being on a winning streak.|Fresh
A cinematographic jewel in which the director sacrifices nothing of his accustomed caustic humor even when he's telling the hard history of a Syrian refugee trying to survive in a distant and indifferent Helsinki. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A poignantly contemporaneous deadpan comedy which is surely amongst the greatest of his 20-or-so features.|Fresh
A gently loving fable with a straightforward political message that home can be wherever you find it.|Fresh
A funny, heartfelt story about the Syrian refugee crisis that's not dissimilar to the Finnish director's 2011 film Le Havre.|Fresh
This is a world that reeks of cigarette smoke and cheap vodka, yet as always in the work of Finland's maestro of droll melancholy, the perfume that lingers longest is empathy.|Fresh
As economical in his visual style as he is with his dialogue, Kaurismaki makes the most out of having his actors do the least.|Fresh
There aren't really any surprises in The Other Side of Hope; it's more like witnessing the ongoing cultivation of a humane philosophy. But the film is devilishly funny ...|Fresh
"""The Other Side of Hope"" wants to take you back to a time when quirkiness in cinema felt not cute but bold. Apart from the songs, though, it just feels cute now. If that."|Rotten
