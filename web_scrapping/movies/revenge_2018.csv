Coralie Fargeat ... directs with style and grit, painting a visceral picture that never shies away from being bloody or racy, but manages to avoid falling into exploitation.|Fresh
"Even its plot holes and inconsistencies cease to become much of a point. ""Revenge"" is just that satisfying to watch as [Coralie] Fargeat uses genre staples and gender expectations to give us a gruesomely satisfying thrill ride."|Fresh
With a pared down plot and only four characters present for any substantial amount of time, this film relies entirely on force of personality. Thankfully, it has that in spades.|Fresh
Overwhelming emotions and feminist prowess are drawn from the visceral, agonizing, and often-cartoonish images that hold this sick n' ferocious film together.|Fresh
Matilda Lutz is clearly a stand-out in an exciting twist on a well-worn genre.|Fresh
What Revenge lacks in believable biology it makes up for in style and highly satisfying action beats.|Fresh
Nothing about Fargeat's approach to this tale is the least bit nuanced or subdued, because said tale practically demands a primal scream.|Fresh
Whilst the message is necessary, the power is lost in a slow movie that lacks the effectiveness of its French genre contemporaries.|Rotten
Revenge excels on nearly every technical level, and while the plot fits neatly into the rape-revenge subgenre, it easily puts all others to shame.|Fresh
Fargeat masterfully plays up to stereotypes before ingeniously subverting and owning them.|Fresh

Inside its gorgeous, candy-colored packaging -- as confident a debut as we've seen in recent years -- Revenge has a warrior of a protagonist who is easy to root for, villains who are easy to hate, and satisfactory justice dispensed.|Fresh
Revenge is an intense, mesmerizing, and extremely brutal film. I can say without a doubt this film was my favorite at the International Horror and Sci-fi Film festival.|Fresh
Vengeance is a dish served gory in this stylish, brutish bloodbath.|Fresh
Had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.|Fresh
Coralie Fargeat's Revenge, an overly stylized and banal riff on Abel Ferrara's Ms. 45, mistakes ambiguity for profundity.|Rotten
Director Coralie Fargeat brings a unique sensibility to the way bodies - both female and male - are framed and it's clear that Revenge brings something new to the game.|Fresh
It announces the birth of a stunning new directorial voice.|Fresh
Revenge lives in a lucid cartoon blood bath with an added feminist manifesto. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Fargeat's grasp of male entitlement and the elements of a rape culture are as sharp as her instincts for visual storytelling.|Fresh

Feminist TNT. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Revenge is bloody, disturbing, tense, and highly stylized. French horror is so exciting right now and I can't wait to see more from Coralie Fargeat.|Fresh
The script, lamentable in all aspects, does not even spend some time to develop the personality of the protagonist so that it rises slightly above the male villains. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The French director shapes a feminist slasher film proclamation, dirty and extreme, as provocative as it is necessary, in which a superb Lutz ... stands as the ultimate weapon of female empowerment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
If you can live with such a graphically violent film, you got yourself a bloody good one.|Fresh
... an announcement, or a first emblematic symptom, of the positioning of women in the film industry who have placed the systematic abuse of men in their spotlight. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The deliberately paced story lacks credibility and surprise. However, the dazzling visuals - not for the squeamish - along with Lutz's ferocious performance more than compensate.|Fresh
Revenge is as much a jarringly smart exploration of gendered violence as it is a slasher spectacle.|Fresh
Fargeat avoids modern cliches, such as altered timelines or found footage, to deliver a suspenseful nail-biter of a thriller, one that updates an old format with an interesting take on gender politic|Fresh
It's a blood-soaked fable, a rape-revenge movie made with style and subtext.|Fresh
A stunning reinvention of the rape-revenge exploitation film that had me sitting at the edge of my seat first frame to last.|Fresh
Fargeat's sunny, Morocco-set film first deconstructs, then rebuilds those mechanics from an uncompromising feminist perspective.|Fresh
I'll admit, I've always had a hard time with rape-revenge thrillers... but [Revenge] asks us to look deeper, especially in the behaviour of women which is often considered worthy of blame when there should be none.|Fresh
Revenge, one of the great revenge fantasies of the last few decades, is a fantastically visceral film, full of blood and pain and countless opportunities for audience members to hide their eyes.|Fresh
Revenge is hardly profound - and some will surely find it all very distasteful - but tense, traumatic and eye-wateringly gory, it sure sizzles off the screen.|Fresh
In theory it's nothing you haven't seen, but Revenge will make you feel like it is your first time.|Fresh
Pretty fantastic and is held up by the intense performances, particularly by Matilda Lutz.|Fresh
Finding beauty in brutality, Revenge takes risks, and not only in its grotesque subject matter. The film has unmatched aesthetic ambitions, as waves of vibrant, hyper-stylized sounds and colors elevate the relentless bloodbath.|Fresh
Rape vengeance with an artistically minded cinematic mean streak; Coralie Faregeat's debut is a primal display of female empowerment and revenge that is sure to somewhere have even Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman erupting in applause.|Fresh
Torture and injury ensue, but nothing is as off-putting as the visual excesses which smack of student film-making beneath the high production values...|Rotten
First-time French director Coralie Fargeat has delivered one hell of a calling card, attacking the screen with Revenge, a debut movie that leaves a bloody, indelible impression.|Fresh
This rape-revenge action horror is solid as pure grindhouse exploitation. But the rendering of its rage-fueled female protagonist is too salacious for this to ever be considered feminist.|Fresh
The sheer flamboyance of the whole thing guarantees the viewer's surrender.|Fresh
With good handling of the narrative rhythm, we soon discover that the subject goes beyond nice photography and that we are facing a strong and decisive conceptual proposal... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Revenge is part trashy exploitation flick, part Looney Tunes romp.|Fresh
The way Fargeat plays with these tropes gives her film an edge.|Fresh
Revenge is a dish that's best served cold but a very bloody one in the case of Coralie Fargeat's feature directorial debut...a marvelous performance by Matilda Lutz...|Fresh
It's a film that manages to leer at its scantily clad heroine only to eventually make you root for her to dish out as much bloody punishment as possible.|Fresh
Revenge is smartly made.|Fresh
With Revenge, Fargeat has waved a blistering middle finger at rape culture and rape culture's enablers. Revenge isn't hers alone. It's womanhood's, too.|Fresh
It's a ludicrously gory, over-the-top, woman-on-a-rampage grindhouse film... and I kind of loved it.|Fresh
The only real surprise is the sheer volume of gore: If gouged eyeballs, exploded heads, impaled torsos, and beautiful naked people flailing through pools of vital fluids are what you crave, you will be a fan, and I won't judge you.|Fresh
Revenge's story doesn't reinvent the rape/vengeance genre all by itself, it's Fargeat's choices as a filmmaker that set this film apart from the rest.|Fresh
Though the film makes a valiant effort to subvert a sexist formula by shrouding itself in French art film trappings and pseudo-empowering femininity, it ultimately falls prey to its exploitative roots.|Rotten
Ah, but is it a good revenge movie? Oui, vraiment, and one that doesn't leave you feeling particularly sordid.|Fresh
Revenge is a brutal, bloody, exhilarating work that does not even for a moment blink.|Fresh
This story ... uses the abuse of a woman as a means of creating some thrills, but at least the thrills of Revenge aren't cheap.|Fresh
Fargeat winks at the audience just before hitting them right in the gut.|Fresh
It is not subtle, it is not for the fainthearted, but it is worth it.|Fresh
"Coralie Fargeat tears into the rape revenge genre with a startling ferocity in her debut feature, the brutal, bloody and beautiful ""Revenge."""|Fresh

Writer-director Coralie Fargeat has come up with something so brutally atavistic, specifics would only get in the way.|Fresh
It all becomes very silly and very panto... The claims for feminist credibility feel very last-ditch indeed.|Rotten
"In fact, ""satisfying"" is maybe the most appropriate word to describe the feeling of viewing Revenge. It's amazing to look at, interesting to analyze, and has a gut-level intensity that's hard to shake."|Fresh
For a shot of adrenaline in your next cinema trip, look no further - a future cult classic for sure.|Fresh
It's more of a gruesome thriller. But in its understanding of some very real anxieties - and its willingness to amp them up for the purposes of tension and social commentary - Revenge earns that designation pretty quickly.|Fresh
Revenge is brutal and relentless, but it's all in service of a powerful rise from literal ashes.|Fresh
The male gaze is obviously a pivotal trope to grindhouse movies, and rape revenge in particular. But does it have to be? And at what point does critiquing the thing merely become recreating it?|Rotten
The film is going to strain your suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. But if you can get past one particular event, you're going to find Revenge a madcap, satisfying thrill ride.|Fresh
Offers a woman's POV on the age-old tale and succeeds in turning a B concept soaked in blood into a pure adrenaline rush of terror, grounded firmly in the real and horrifying dynamics that breed rape culture.|Fresh
The film we need right now, from a filmmaker we need right now.|Fresh
Equal parts feminist empowerment manifesto and raging red Grand Guignol heart-stopper, Revenge is, in the end, a dish best served up with cold blue steel and righteous rivers of sauce au sang.|Fresh
"""Revenge"" is an all-or-nothing thrill ride, some of which you'll likely watch between the fingers covering your eyes."|Fresh
A well made film, which slithers confidently in its slick of blood.|Fresh
Together with the many grotesquely gruesome moments of body horror, [the] aesthetic signals the film's tangential relation to reality, and turns Revenge into an overwhelming and unshakeable sensory experience.|Fresh
Turns the exploitation model on its head ... without skimping on the blood, pain, and satisfying kickassery that the audience for a rape-revenge thriller came to see.|Fresh
Revenge is slick and stylish but also very shallow. It's more a cartoon than a real piece of drama.|Rotten
The film knows it's off the grid, off the leash and, for climactic violence, off the chart. That's its strength.|Fresh
Coralie Fargeat teams breathtaking desert visuals with ultra close-ups to distinctive and queasy effect.|Fresh
Revenge, the debut film by Coralie Fargeat, is unapologetic in its use of the genre as a brash, blood-and-guts crowd pleaser. Its contribution to social discourse may be limited, but it should be a good time for any midnight movie crowd.|Fresh
Fargeat's feature debut provides a down-and-dirty jolt of feminist rage and retribution that gets one's pulse pounding-and which feels especially potent at this particular sociocultural moment in time.|Fresh
Written and directed by Coralie Fargeat, her feature debut represents a welcome dose of feminism-fuelled subversion as she presents her own take on the rape-revenge narrative.|Fresh
Apparently, peyote is a drug so powerful, it can turn a half-dead rape victim into a vengeful super-soldier.|Fresh
A brutal, brilliant feminist Grindhouse masterclass, with a welcome challenge to the male gaze of ostensibly similar horrorshows.|Fresh
"""Revenge"" leaves a lurid, punchy afterimage, an impression somewhere between righteous delight and quivering revulsion."|Fresh
With the near-unbearable scenes of self-surgery, sexual violence and several bathtubs' worth of blood, this is an uneasy and intense watch. See it if you can stand it.|Fresh
A film that will set midnight movie devotees cheering for generations...|Fresh
A slick production, but not the subversive classic we were hoping for.|Rotten
If Fargeat can sustain the purposeful visual and narrative complexity of [this film's] two bookends throughout her next, watch out.|Fresh
The film is so outrageously cool that genre fans will love it.|Fresh
It maintains a dizzying and fun rhythm, fantastically unreal but, at the same time, brutally real... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Revenge is apparently a dish best served beneath dollops of red corn syrup.|Fresh
Fargeat spares no expense with the gore, sending the film's heroes and villains through the ringer, from gutsy shotgun blasts to gaping foot injuries that would send Bruce Campbell to the infirmary in tears.|Fresh
A bloody good time.|Fresh
Fetishism, parody, and various registers of violence propel a livewire thriller that mines the free-floating hostility existing between genders.|Fresh
[Coralie] Fargeat has re-appropriated rape revenge with an extremely satisfying and empowering horror film that's also pretty to look at when you're not trying to keep your dinner down.|Fresh
"Purportedly a feminist film because its rape victim is a superhuman survivor who fights back...Coralie Fargeat's ""Revenge"" is a stylishly shot exploitation movie whose heroine is defined by the amount of butt cheek peeking out of her short shorts."|Rotten
Revenge is a blockbuster debut, and if all is right in the world, Fargeat will be making movies for a very long time to come.|Fresh
Jen shifts violently from the film's object to its subject, messily deconstructing the 'look' (of which she was initially a part) of the film, to expose the ugly humanity (and, more particularly, masculinity) hidden beneath all that seductive sheen|Fresh
Equal parts suspense and wearing each other down, there's only three villains so they fill the running time. And these are not expert killers on either side. There are no clean shots. They're knock down drag out fights, drenched in blood.|Fresh
Revenge is a French horror film that starts off rocky but finds it's way home.|Fresh
It's beyond a shadow of a doubt the first great horror film of 2018.|Fresh
Shudder recently acquired Revenge and I do recommend folks give it a view, even if you find the subject matter at hand particularly hard to handle.|Fresh
An aggressively stylized, absolutely brutal rape-revenge film from French newcomer Coralie Fargeat.|Fresh
Revenge climaxes with a stellar and impressively violent final stretch that confirms its place as a superior vengeance-themed actioner.|Fresh
An astonishing, subversive take on tired clichs.|Fresh
It's an exploitation movie that knowingly abuses the male gaze and then turns that uncivilized, leering lens on its head, placing us squarely in the shoes of its brutalized angel of vengeance.|Fresh
Ample style, remarkable tension, decidedly French black humor, and more blood than I believe the human body actually contains.|Fresh
Tautly controlled and wildly over-the-top, executed with flashy style, sly visual humor and a subversive feminist sensibility.|Fresh
