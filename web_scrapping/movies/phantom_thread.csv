Anderson makes movies that may refuse to explain themselves but nevertheless manage to engage the viewer, in part because he tends to cut from confined spaces to open ones as if inviting us to enter them.|Fresh
There's not a lot of action in the film, but yet PTA made even the seemingly mundane act of sewing, cutting fabric, and especially cooking, so intriguing... and suspenseful.|Fresh
A very well made movie by Paul Thomas Anderson with good performances; however, I didn't connect with it.|Fresh
Phantom Thread feels like a guilty gift, stolen from another era of filmmaking. It has an arched brow and a vocabulary of withering, delightful insults, all accompanied by Jonny Greenwood's masterpiece of a score.|Fresh
"Take away the awards season touches, and ""Phantom Thread"" is just another story about upholding monogamy and family life at all costs."|Rotten
One of the best movies of the past ten years. Granted, I think everything PTA does is up my alley, but this one particularly strikes all the right chords and says a lot about co-dependence.|Fresh
The film is filled with such realism and has many recesses and nuances that do make for a great experience. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
... an intoxicating tale with several dichotomies between authority and submission, power and fragility, passion and contempt...|Fresh

Above all else, Phantom Thread is a love story. A twisted one, but yes a love story and a memorable one at that. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
As beautiful as it is twisted, Phantom Thread is a film worth unraveling, with wonderful performances, Anderson's unpredictable storytelling and Greenwood's emotionally stirring score that is sure to appeal to adventurous cinemagoers.|Fresh
As meticulously crafted as a Reynolds evening gown...|Fresh
Phantom Thread remains a grounded yet exultant romance to its end, even when its love story snakes off in some disquieting and utterly unexpected directions.|Fresh
Krieps' take on Alma is delightful and she injects a lot of wit and bite into what could have been an underdeveloped character.|Fresh
It's hard to watch [Anderson's] work now and make comparisons ... because who else out there is turning tortured darkness into such tactical, tactile beauty? And with such an elegant acuity that even a simple dissolve can send you into rapturous ecstasy?|Fresh
Phantom Thread is the cinematic definition of pretentiousness, a film that secretly giggles to itself as mainstream audiences struggle to understand or maintain interest.|Rotten
Phantom Thread is much like its central character-exquisite, dapper, precise, rich in color and complexity.|Fresh
There is a fine line drawn between possession and love that Anderson obscures, blurs, and then erases entirely.|Fresh
"The full effect comes from seeing the pieces slowly into focus - even after the ""reveals"" have been set, it's not really until the final few minutes where you realize what the story has actually been about up to this point."|Fresh
[Phantom Thread] is deliciously hilarious in its nastiness, especially when blurted with full pompous force by Daniel Day-Lewis.|Fresh
If this is to be Daniel Day-Lewis' swan song, he's gone out on a high.|Fresh
This is a darkly comic and quite cynical concoction that features outstanding work from Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps.|Fresh
The film, like Reynolds' own artistic creations, is highly considered and filled with obsessive detail, Anderson's filmmaking as intricate and delicate as lace.|Fresh
Courage, of the Phantom Thread variety, is less a matter of tangible objects and action than something ephemeral.|Fresh
By its premise, I thought Phantom Thread was going to be yet another movie that heaps praise upon tortured genius, nevermind the costs that women have to bear. I was so relieved to be proven wrong.|Fresh
A breathtaking character study of love's unyielding ability to simultaneously conjure fear and embolden with confidence.|Fresh
As visual music grounded in a feeling of preposterous luxury, this is as enveloping and experimental as anything Anderson has done.|Fresh
A fascinatingly layered piece of cinema that confounds and enraptures in equal measure.|Fresh
Namely, it is a meditation on creation and recreation, on the tricky nature of inspiration, on an artist's obsession, on the surprising intimacy between creator and creation.|Fresh
Phantom Thread manages the difficult but not entirely laudable feat of being both unpredictable and staid.|Fresh
Does it look great? Yes. Is Daniel Day-Lewis great? Certainly.... While the last ten minutes are entertaining, it is a heck of a long trek to get there.|Rotten
Artistically, Phantom Thread might be the best film of the year. Nevertheless...|Fresh
We are terrified and fascinated as we watch these lives being lived onscreen.|Fresh
"It's ravishing but unmoving, full of details but lacking in vitality, fascinating in a removed way but not engrossing. If it is possible to be impressed but bored at the same time, that is the experience ""Phantom Thread"" creates."|Rotten
Visually precise and gracefully paced, Phantom Thread has all the makings of a gentle melodrama with perfect posture. But don't let its elegance fool you. Paul Thomas Anderson's dense portrait of warped love likes to spit venom.|Fresh
This is deft filmmaking by Anderson, a movie where every shot has a lyrical quality to it.|Fresh
"Day-Lewis is no stranger to playing the odd duck, and he dives wholeheartedly into giving us yet another fascinating character. ""Phantom Thread"" is a blend of excellent writing and satin performances."|Fresh
Phantom Thread is a delicate story that is tight and unpredictable because the relationships are complex, and Anderson has developed characters that are, like real human beings, many things at once.|Fresh
If you don't hold the movie's pompous style against it - if you accept its style as part of the movie's oblique point about creativity - it is Anderson's most satisfying yet about the beasts beneath the politesse of what is amusingly called society.|Fresh
This is an old-fashioned film about romance that dares to play out like the love affair it depicts. It sweeps the viewer up in its embrace, whirls them from one emotional extreme to the next, leaving them exhilarated.|Fresh
On reflection, this idea resonates long after the film is over, a key to what makes Phantom Thread as beautiful as it is disturbing. Like a cinematic swan dive into the shadows.|Fresh
"""Phantom Thread"" is nothing that it pretends. It is considered a cardinal sin for an actor to break character, and yet that is exactly what Daniel Day-Lewis's and Vicky Krieps's personas do."|Rotten
The monstrous budget of Daniel Day-Lewis' final film went to neither plot nor cast but into a feast of beautiful sight and sound.|Fresh
It is cinema in its purest form. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The literalism of this kind of sound design, even if you would never notice that sound in real life, is as distracting as an unasked for pot of tea shuffled into the room when you are working.|Fresh
Day-Lewis, in what he claims to be his final role, is quite marvellous: cruel, vulnerable, humorous and preening. Impressively, Manville and Krieps hold their own.|Fresh
The film is a mix of chamber narrative and character study, leading the viewer to gradually understand how the oscillation between vulnerability and force is an essential part of the main couple's dynamics. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
[Vicky Krieps] is a work of character imbued with the style of its director. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A masterpiece. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
I do not know if it is the best movie that Anderson has directed but I think it has the best ending of his entire filmography. If it is true that Day Lewis is retiring from acting... it is an extraordinary farewell. (Review in Spanish in Reforma.com)|Fresh
Daniel Day-Lewis is splendid in this role, which marks his farewell to cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Any movie that can turn the cooking of a mushroom omelette into a psychosexual case study is essential.|Fresh
Krieps... gives the impression of a woman who may well be able to stand still longer than anyone else, but who, on the inside, is trembling almost imperceptibly with energy, appetite, and rage.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is either about two people with serious mental health problems whose lives elegantly collide or about the externalization of interior love so profound that they are willing to go to unfathomable lengths to finally admit it.|Fresh
'Phantom Thread' weaves a beautiful, strange tale.|Fresh
A couturier with an Oedipus complex the size of his obsession. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
At first glance, this might seem the most distant work of Paul Thomas Anderson's canon, but in reality, what we see in Phantom Thread is the evolution of an author. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Phantom Thrad is a lament for antiquated generations, not a celebration of the status quo. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
... a sophisticated and incisive portrait of a narcissist who in each dress leaves a piece of himself that allows him to see each woman. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Paul Thomas Anderson... does everything with the patience of the craftsman. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Anderson may have outdone himself with his latest tale.|Fresh
What this project does reveal about Anderson is his interest in turning away from isolated obsessives toward the alchemy of collaboration. The course of Phantom Thread traces this narrative with the precision of a couture designer following his pattern.|Fresh
...an excellent character study, a movie that depends more on characterisation and interaction, than on a traditional narrative...[Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A fitting exit for one of the greatest screen actors in history.|Fresh
The movie leaves behind a profound afterthought, a feeling that we have just been roused by an idea that has not yet been spoken or discovered.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is an engrossing character study as we watch all three individuals try to gain the upper hand in his curious household.|Fresh
I came away from seeing it feeling both unmoved and dissatisfied.|Rotten
Cinematically rich and dramatically magnetic...[A] film that often looks like a moving work of art, as though perfectly composed still life images have been brought to shimmering life.|Fresh
"What an interesting double session on creation and its hells would form with the violently different ""mother!."" [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
As the pic's end titles arrive, we realize just how well it's done its fancy, cagey thing, never compromising and stiffly rebuffing the negative connotations of melodrama.|Fresh
If you want to exit it arguing about what exactly it's doing and how women should fight back against sexism, this should be your choice - and its embrace of ambivalence and refusal to settle for easy answers are all too rare these days.|Fresh
It's impossible to take your eyes off the screen in Phantom Thread, a masterful work with a core both dark and romantic.|Fresh
New Year celebrations have only recently been and gone, but it may well prove difficult to find a more perfect film than Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread in 2018.|Fresh
"""Phantom Thread"" is filmmaking of the highest order, without a stitch out of place."|Fresh
...a perfect exercise of prestidigitation on the art of loving, between the comedy, the obsession and the fever. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A surprisingly homogeneous and unique film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Daniel Day-Lewisis on] another plane than everyone else.|Fresh
At first, it looks like just another safe, crowd-pleasing period drama aimed at the NPR crowd. Rather, it's a fascinating slow-burn character study that's not afraid to embrace a little darkness, with a wry sense of humor.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is perhaps [Paul Thomas Anderson's] most compelling, maddening, entrancing story to date.|Fresh
Between a score that features incessantly twinkly piano music which makes viewers feel like they're trapped in an elevator, and Day-Lewis' constant preening, Phantom Thread is utterly insufferable|Rotten
The entire film is an acting master-class. Precisely delivered epigrammatic dialogue is interspersed with looks and gestures that speak a thousand words yet never say too much|Fresh
A masterpiece ... The multiple thoughts, contradictions and emotions these actors are allowed to display under Anderson's watchful eye are mind-boggling in their multitude ... Enormously disciplined, precise, and bold.|Fresh
Reflecting Day-Lewis' cadaverous appearance, there is no fat on this lean and sinuous affair which is far removed from cuddly Sunday night TV drama. It's a shocking and intense tale of obsession, with alarming moments of humour.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is a gorgeous film loaded with so many visual details that it requires multiple viewings to absorb them all, and to process and digest the unsettling relationship between Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Alma Elson (Vicky Krieps).|Fresh
Daniel Day-Lewis has turned in a measured, masterful performance of a flawed man who could be tender and kind, petulant and dismissive, and deeply hurtful. What a swan song.|Fresh
You know, I don't even want to try to understand how Paul Thomas Anderson knows what to do to make exquisite films. Watching Phantom Thread, I just want to let him get on with it.|Fresh
It's tantamount to cinematic transubstantiation and Anderson and Day-Lewis deliver, turning blood to bread and water to wine, leaving us all but paralyzed.|Fresh
The movie is a romantic-baroque chamber piece about an unloving heart.|Fresh
The frocks, period setting and acting are all exquisite, and both Day-Lewis and Manville deserve their Oscar nominations. But be warned: the screenplay is heading somewhere dark, unexpected and ultimately disappointing.|Fresh
For all Anderson and Day-Lewis's accomplishments I found it almost impossible to care about this preening bully and his latest conquest.|Rotten
I've seen Phantom Thread three times now, and each time I have been gripped ever tighter in its sublimely eerie and immaculately constructed web.|Fresh
A high-flown drama directed pretentiously, with a style that prioritises debonair aesthetic while the subtext of the script moves in the opposite direction - telling us that fancy accouterments cannot hide deeper issues of character and substance.|Rotten
Sensuous, evocative and completely entrancing, if the end result was a garment, you wouldn't want to take it off.|Fresh
Day-Lewis burrows into his role with characteristic intensity. Manville is spot-on as the stern but sympathetic sibling. The accomplished Krieps gives an Oscar-worthy performance.|Fresh
Indeed, the oppressive style and sublimated Hitchcockian tensions might not be for everyone either, but I loved this film, omelette and all, and suspect it will eventually be seen as a Gothic classic.|Fresh
There are shades of Hitchcock, notably Rebecca and Notorious. But this is a film to savour not for its narrative twists but its air of thickening psychological complexity.|Fresh
In this atelier of intense emotions, Anderson has crafted an old-fashioned romance about the very foundation of modern romance.|Fresh
There may not be blood in this final collaboration between Day-Lewis and director-screenwriter Paul Thomas Anderson, but psychic mayhem surely lies in wait.|Fresh
"But the star, as always in an Anderson movie, is the writer-director himself. As ""Phantom Thread"" progresses, Anderson keeps us off-balance, never quite explaining what each character is up to as he or she moves from one scene to the next."|Fresh
What a stunning film.|Fresh
Possibly Paul Thomas Anderson's best film since that American auteur's staggeringly assured early work.|Fresh
A riveting psychological study of which Hitchcock might have been proud.|Fresh
The pin-sharp precision of the dialogue, the magnificent, lilting musical score from Jonny Greenwood and the quality of the performances all combine to create an audacious, spellbinding slice of storytelling.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is an oddity. It's a movie about love and obsession and obsessive love. It's Freudian and sadomasochistic, and for one glorious moment, almost passes off as director Paul Thomas Anderson's answer to Fifty Shades of Grey.|Fresh
... I challenge you not to be grimly compelled by every minute of Phantom Thread.|Fresh
If Daniel Day-Lewis is genuinely going to make good on his recent retirement announcement, he couldn't have picked a better swansong than Phantom Thread.|Fresh
It is a wonderfully fixating film in every respect, and wholly non-formulaic.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is a literate, engrossing and undeniably powerful film.|Fresh
If Phantom Thread has a problem, it is that it's so full of fraught confrontations, even those that are outwardly genteel, that it sometimes feels more like a compilation of outstanding scenes than a great movie.|Rotten
Phantom Thread's apparent severity is a brilliant disguise that only really unravels in retrospect: what's underneath is a battle-of-the-sexes comedy that ruthlessly strips away layers of archetype and artifice.|Fresh
Multi-tasker Anderson's ruthlessly exacting handling of the material here (the finicky historical period, the gorgeous dresses, the lovingly semi-old-school camerawork) is rather mirrored in the anal-retentively precise way that Reynolds carries on.|Fresh
As for Day-Lewis' retirement plans, we can only hope that he reconsiders. But if this is indeed his final performance then it's one hell of a swansong.|Fresh
Phantom Thread's love story is, umm, unconventional. Well, whatever works!|Fresh
...a sumptuous, elegant, exquisite creation of the finest quality, stitched together by a master of the craft.|Fresh
The movie is a lot like its star's performance - fussy and mysterious. And subversively funny.|Fresh
Paul Thomas Anderson weaves a mystery of romantic obsession around the lead pair. The journey until the final unveiling would not be half as engaging if it weren't for the brutally raw and sincere performances by the actors.|Fresh
The pleasure here lies in the unpredictability of Paul Thomas Anderson's approach, his ability and that of his actors to surprise us with every new stitch of the movie.|Fresh
Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, Phantom Thread is a definitive return to the same great form that marked his last collaboration with Day-Lewis, There Will Be Blood.|Fresh
Take your seat; settle comfortably; prepare to be taken to hell and back, by a master tour guide using the scenic route.|Fresh
Despite swoonsome visuals, it's a constricting, prickly and demanding film, the portrait of a very odd love affair shot through a very male lens...Think Fifty Shades Of Grey for the couture crowd.|Fresh
Daniel Day Lewis' swan song is a wonderfully delirious and bewitching masterpiece.|Fresh
Paul Thomas Anderson 's sly oddness is all his own. Heck, the thing is nearly a comedy.|Fresh
Anderson crafts another classic of obsession and strange love, played by dynamite leads: Day-Lewis retires in style, Krieps is revelatory.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is a Gothic romance with a radiant and beautiful wrapping that contains a mystery as brutal as it is human. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[An] obsessive and elegant chronicle of an industry. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Paul Thomas Anderson does gothic romance in prestige Brit picture style, eliciting a worthy final performance from Daniel Day-Lewis that's admirably matched by newcomer Vicky Krieps.|Fresh
Anderson has turned in an idiosyncratic character study that's cut from the same cloth as post-war melodrama, but has a modern style all its own.|Fresh
But we never become invested in these prickly characters, their relationship, or their insular world.|Rotten
This film's tensive beauty and white-hot performances, not to mention its brilliant score and letter-perfect direction, may well distract the average filmgoer from the profound messages lurking in the screenplay.|Fresh
If this is indeed Day-Lewis' swan song before leaving us and the world of moviemaking for good, he's certainly going out on an up note. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
A stunning film with enchanting performances from Day Lewis and Manville. Perfectly made, with an assured hand, this is a truly remarkable film.|Fresh
I was mostly riveted by this movie because of the incredible work from both Daniel Day-Lewis, and the actress who portrays Alma (Vicky Krieps).|Fresh
As the demanding 1950s fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock, the excellent Daniel Day-Lewis may get top billing, but the film belongs to Vicky Krieps as Alma.|Fresh
Just like the intricate and lush gowns Woodcock produces, [Paul Thomas] Anderson has also gifted us with a gorgeous film to behold.|Fresh
If this is Daniel Day-Lewis' last film performance he leaves us with a mess.|Rotten
As anyone would expect, Day-Lewis gives a performance that's a fitting curtain call for a career that he leaves as one of the all-time greats.|Fresh
"It's Alma and Cyril that make ""Phantom Thread"" so engrossing."|Fresh
Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's period piece is a work of art. He expands his exploration on relationship dynamics to reveal a wickedly humorous newfound romance that is both suffocating and Machiavellian.|Fresh
The pace is stately and the visuals are lush, pushed along nicely by the neo-classical music score of frequent Anderson collaborator Jonny Greenwood.|Fresh
Anderson's divine, poetically scripted and unpredictable melodrama examines the impact of emotional upheaval on the fragile mind of a finely tuned creative.|Fresh
When a film that plays like an adult romance switches gears and becomes a Grimm's fairy tale, it makes for a final half-hour that dragged on to an outrageous conclusion.|Rotten
The great actor Daniel Day Lewis announced that this would be his last film, and leaves us with an astonishing, confounding and perverse performance.|Fresh
I love this film. Just as a beautiful gown is created from unique design and exquisite fabric, so too is this bewitching film about secrets, obsession and elegance.|Fresh
Like, love or hate his movies, Paul Thomas Anderson is a filmmaker of uncompromising vision.|Fresh
This one, I admit, completely sailed over my head.|Rotten
"""...an emotional experience that demands to be watched in rapt attention, with all of our cinematic cylinders firing at once."""|Fresh
It looks and sounds gorgeous, and the acting is wonderful, but I just wish the emotions on display in this film were more accessible, and not so alien.|Fresh
A work of great social elegance. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Meticulously performed, exquisitely designed -- lovely. Even if I don't care if I never see it again.|Fresh
If this is Day-Lewis' last film (and I hope it is not) then it sums up his career in a sweetly satisfying and intimate way.|Fresh
Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread is passionless window-shop cinema, each static tableau lovingly arranged for display and easy dusting.|Rotten
[Paul Thomas] Anderson masterfully displays such a focus of self in the secrets within the fabrics within the rooms within the house of the main character that the film often swerves into the hyperreal as reflective of his finely tuned sensitivities.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is another gorgeous fever dream of a film by Anderson, with Day-Lewis' powerhouse performance matched by his costar Vicky Krieps' here.|Fresh
This is a perverse and elegantly wrought romance, as well as an evocative period piece, unpredictable from beginning to deliciously Hitchcockian end.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is a revisionist genre film. Set in the 1950s, it not only reworks fashion flicks from Lucy Gallant to Funny Face (the complementary confluence of two industries) but perverts their female-objectifying iconography.|Rotten
"""Phantom Thread is a movie filled with performances that feel like the best Method acting from the mid-20th century, when actors like Montgomery Clift and Julie Harris seemed to know every minute of each day in the past lives of their characters."""|Fresh
Theirs is a singular love affair, an arrangement of souls who work like hell to find a place of harmony together, and once nestled in, have no interest in ever turning away.|Fresh
It's clear that Anderson didn't make a period piece; he made a movie that looks like it was made in the 1950s.|Fresh
... an unsatisfactory psychodrama presented with a smirk.|Rotten
There's so much cinema squeezed into every single frame of Phantom Thread you don't feel the need to watch any other film for a long time. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
In Phantom Thread, Anderson has the intriguing setting and characters but not much drama.|Fresh
Some movies, like writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's luxurious and breathtaking Phantom Thread, are the equivalent of high fashion, allowing us to get lost in the beauty and fantasy of their folds.|Fresh
If the job of a film is to immerse you into another world, its customs, its music, its glitter and its rottenness, Paul Thomas Anderson's The Phantom Thread fulfills its mission beautifully.|Fresh
Take a bite out of Phantom Thread, and you'll find a coating of the finest chocolate concealing a center of powdered glass.|Fresh
"It's almost impossible to describe Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread without using words like ""sublime"" and ""ravishing"" and ""rapturous."""|Fresh
Phantom Thread is both a moment for celebration and a moment for mourning.|Fresh
The sexiest and most perverse movie experience of 2017 does not include a single sex scene. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Designed with the elegance of a Max Ophüls film, written to combine the social observation of Henry James and the foreboding of Alfred Hitchcock, and scored with a narcotic elegance by Jonny Greenwood.|Fresh
A conundrum of a film that defies genre as it twirls us around a wickedly fascinating triad of gently, quietly manipulative people. A cinematic experience of sly eeriness and oblique mystique.|Fresh
[It] ever so slowly twists and turns until it is quite a different sort of story that I enjoyed very much.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is as puzzling and tantalizing as the subject of beauty itself, a movie quite unlike anything else we'll see this year.|Fresh
Majestically directed, written and acted, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film results in a meticulous and obsessive cinematic experience, in which Daniel Day-Lewis is once again brilliant. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The second collaboration between [Paul Thomas] Anderson and [Daniel] Day-Lewis is a masterful, gorgeous and provocative work of art.|Fresh
grotesque personality, and the shock and awe attendant to the select few who can see through genius and, for better or for worse, cut to the quick.|Fresh
How Alma and Woodcock find harmony is fascinating, even a little odd, since they avoid the typical path of a couple in love.|Fresh
Phantom Thread, a film about concealment that is also an exercise in concealment, can very satisfyingly be read backwards and forwards, from inside out and outside in.|Fresh
Beneath the mental camouflage and cerebral trickery is an elemental story about love, power, control, and an entitled man's reckoning with the life he's made for himself. And what a reckoning it is!|Fresh
Maybe the most heavily, visibly crafted film of 2017, a celebration of the work of making movies wrapped inside a celebration of the work of making dresses.|Fresh
It's not a ghost story, but the movie will haunt you long after the lights come up.|Fresh
"... ""The Phantom Thread"" sublimely dramatizes a pas-de-deux of obsession and passion."|Fresh
... Anderson has crafted for the three-time Academy Award winner a role fitting of his legendary talents.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is a great, great film and one of the most genuinely romantic dramas I have seen in a long time.|Fresh
At 130 minutes, this Thread requires some sitting skills. It's a film of chilly design, but its beauty warms up over time, aided by a seductive score from Jonny Greenwood, mixed with apt period music.|Fresh
What builds novel-like expectations at the outset winds up feeling like a short story by the end. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't encourage you to see it,|Fresh
The synergy between the three is so uncanny and genuine that you wonder if they weren't brainwashed and shoehorned into their roles - forever to be Reynolds, Alma and Cyril in the waking world of 2018 and onward.|Fresh
"Paul Thomas Anderson evokes Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" and even ""My Fair Lady"" in this dark Gothic romance. DDL says it's his last film (don't bet on it)."|Fresh
Two viewings of Phantom Thread may not be enough. Like the reaction to a well made dress, first you are taken in by its aesthetic. Then you can appreciate its construction. After that comes the joy in slipping it on again, and again...|Fresh
Probably the most aesthetically pleasing film of the year. [Full review in French]|Fresh
Day-Lewis and Krieps both deserve every ounce of praise they're getting for this film, having delivered two of the most nuanced, remarkable performances I've seen this year.|Fresh
This is a fiendishly funny movie, one that follows its own internal logic to a conclusion that makes perfect sense while being entirely mad. I laughed myself sick.|Fresh
I found its 130 minutes spellbinding and mind-bending.|Fresh
Anderson, though, fails to answer a primary question: What is Alma's fascination with Woodcock? He is so shut off and self-absorbed that you cannot understand his appeal, especially to a woman so much younger than him.|Fresh
Reynolds and his sister may be wearing luxurious tweeds, wools, and satins, but as characters they're as stiff and soulless as hulls made from the plainest muslin.|Rotten
Whether you fall for this fable or not, you have to admit that the film achieves an elusive beauty worthy of Henry James or Proust.|Fresh
[W]e're constantly learning about these characters ... [and] repeatedly surprised by the depth with which Anderson imbues them...|Fresh
Phantom Thread is extremely well made - it's a rich confection, salty and sweet - but it has an ending many will outright despise.|Fresh
A strangely cerebral, lovingly fashioned but slightly trashy study of emotional gamesmanship that invites respect for its chilly craftsmanship more than its dramatic resonance.|Fresh
Visually sumptuous though it is, this is a brilliantly nuanced, psychologically complex story about obsession, love, control and surrender, all cloaked in a sophisticated Gothic romance.|Fresh
There are no contemporary cinematic guideposts for Phantom Thread; it is moved only by Anderson's peculiar vision. Looking at the human condition from an acute angle, it finds a secret passage directly into the perverse corners of the heart.|Fresh
"""Phantom Thread"" is the kind of film that's rarely made anymore - uncompromising, sophisticated and smart."|Fresh
That topic has certainly been batted around before on film, but what sets Phantom Thread apart is that it isn't an apologia, or an exorcism. It's a Valentine. The heart, after all, is our strongest muscle.|Fresh
Day-Lewis is right for the role. It's hard to think of an actor more qualified in terms of skill, and by his very nature, to play a walled-off, obsessive creative type.|Fresh
"This perverse adult drama examines the give-and-take of marriage through a very specific microscope, Cyril haunting the relationship like ""Rebecca's"" Mrs. Danvers."|Fresh
"""Phantom Thread"" is a thing of beauty with darkness at its center."|Fresh
It's an enchanting, eventually mischievous meditation on the lengths to which we go to control and camouflage our most intimate, undefended desires.|Fresh
I'd characterize Anderson's film as a romantic comedy with an unusually complicated and profoundly destabilizing happy ending. If that sounds like your thing, then here you are.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is so thematically and performatively dense while maintaining a comedic lightness of touch, that it is one of Anderson's greatest achievements|Fresh
The movie takes a kind of gothic turn by degrees - it sneaks up on you and before you know it, it's arrived. And it's immensely satisfying.|Fresh
Whoever thought that watching Daniel Day-Lewis make a dress could be so interesting?|Fresh
From A-line to eyeline, Anderson's serenely sensual sub-dom stare-down rom-com set in another, ostensibly more romantic era, is generous, wicked and tailored with surprise after surprise.|Fresh
Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson weaves an elegant and often humorous treatise on manipulation and manners in the high-end province of fashion design. It also features one last onscreen performance by the intense Daniel Day Lewis.|Fresh
Strange, shallow, bizarrely superficial Gothic romance, despite charismatic Daniel Day-Lewis's immersive performance.|Rotten
Reynolds is the perfect role for Day-Lewis, who is likewise famous both for his obsessive meticulousness and for the lengthy sabbaticals he has used to recharge between films.|Fresh
One wonders who the audience is for Phantom Thread. It demands a tolerant audience.|Fresh
"Director Paul Thomas Anderson takes a break from films that are trying to ""say something"" to return to a story about people; this is one of his best, most beautiful, and most perverse works."|Fresh
What begins as a sly critique of how society indulges male creative genius reveals itself in the third act to be a gothic romance about control and surrender.|Fresh
It develops into a seductive if slightly creepy portrait of a tortured genius that ultimately succeeds by becoming audaciously unfashionable.|Fresh
The dry ice in this film burns with a hothouse intensity.|Fresh
Is it about the artist and his muse? A Pygmalion story? Beauty and the Beast? My impression was it was a character study of human duality and the quest for fulfillment. All seem possible without quite seeming sufficient.|Fresh
Phantom Thread, as much as it is a meditation on the very real hunger that drives a madman, offers not quite enough in the way of emotional or character nourishment.|Rotten
There are moments of sublime beauty, and dialogue sharp as a tailor's shears.|Fresh
Day-Lewis has hinted that his role in Phantom Thread will be his last for the screen. I seriously doubt this, just as I am sure he will work once again with Paul Thomas Anderson.|Fresh
I realize I'm in a minority who feels that Anderson's work up to and including There Will Be Blood was just a warm-up to the beguiling craftsmanship and thorny emotions in his best films: The Master, Inherent Vice and now Phantom Thread.|Fresh
Certainly a big improvement over Paul Thomas Anderson's last feature, 2014's somewhat disastrous Inherent Vice...|Fresh
To see it as merely beautiful is simply not to see it.|Fresh
Dazzling performances of Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps, and Lesley Manville,|Fresh
It's a film so gleefully peculiar, so brazen in its disinterest in convention or meeting audience satisfaction, that it sort of takes up residence in its own atmosphere.|Fresh
Of all the pleasures to behold in Phantom Thread the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, apparently his last as an actor, is one to savor.|Fresh
Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread is a mesmeric glimpse into the world of high fashion and the cruelties exacted by selfish, self-centered love.|Fresh
Style-centric films tend to play out like parables, impressive costumes and luxurious set pieces working to hide lessons about the danger of corrosive glamour. [This] continues that tradition, but it offers its fashion victim the opportunity to fight back|Fresh
Weird, unusually funny and rather self-controlled for a Paul Thomas Anderson drama.|Fresh
It's a humdinger of a relationship drama, making slow, defined cuts before it bleeds all over the floor.|Fresh
Time will tell, of course, but right now, Phantom Thread feels like a masterwork. Imagine Anderson crossed with du Maurier crossed with Hitchcock crossed with Ibsen and Strindberg. It's that rich and strange.|Fresh
And now Phantom Thread is a half-harrowing, half-tender chamber piece about the nature of love that also pokes, amusingly, at the supposed importance of the Great Artist.|Fresh
An unpredictable, humor-infused courtship drama of sumptuous beauty, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest is a handsome love story, draped with surprising delights.|Fresh
There's very little dialogue and the actors are challenged to emote wordlessly, trusting that the camera will capture their inner thoughts. It's a credit to the formidable Lewis and Krieps, as well as their director, that the movie works at all.|Fresh
"That Daniel Day-Lewis, whose career was launched when he played a cheeky gay punk with a Pakistani boyfriend in ""My Beautiful Laundrette,"" has elected to end his career with this closet caper is more than a tad depressing."|Rotten
The deepest mystery of Phantom Thread, and the strongest source of its suspense, is the question of what these two people might understand about each other, and what emotional bargain they might strike.|Fresh
"Like all of Anderson's efforts, ""Phantom Thread"" is beautiful and intriguing, but it's also a film that is not unlike its central character: easy to respect and admire, and nearly impossible to fully love."|Fresh
Phantom Thread is a movie that is so wonderfully made, so meticulous in its construction, so deeply felt in execution, that you can almost overlook how prickly and scabrous it is.|Fresh
There isn't a wasted frame in Anderson's meditation on the push-and-pull that exists between obsessions professional and personal; the performances are first-rate; if Jonny Greenwood's score is not justly rewarded, there will be outrage|Fresh
Despite everything, we continue to cling to the problems and pursuits of this obsessive dandy. And why? Simply because there has never been an actor as obsessive as Day-Lewis.|Fresh
This is a profoundly, intensely, extravagantly personal film.|Fresh
For Daniel Day-Lewis' final acting job, he gives it his all, playing fashion designed Reynolds Woodcock as a tightly-wound ball of impulses, quirks, and foibles.|Fresh
Phantom Thread intoxicates and needles the viewer, not knowing where it is leading or why Anderson, who's lately made such epic in scope films, chose to make it; until it hits with an emotional bag of hammers.|Fresh
If Phantom Thread truly does represent Daniel Day-Lewis' announced swan-song from acting, he heads into retirement on a high note in terms of his performance. The movie itself is a sumptuous but chilly affair.|Fresh
"It's a more literate, better acted, more tastefully presented version of ""Fifty Shades of Gray,"" all lush settings and the ""sub is truly the dom"" dynamics."|Rotten
It's a rare combination of audacity and precision, impeccably tailored yet full of mystery and magic, like an essential part of it is beyond Anderson's control. Just defining what the film is presents an formidable set of obstacles.|Fresh
Depicting obsession is a trap for any filmmaker. He or she defies the audience to remain interested in someone whose behavior is abnormal. Having Daniel Day-Lewis portraying the character is an enormous asset, but it may not be enough. It wasn't for me.|Rotten
This is a romantic drama with a notable undercurrent of comedy and it's inherently relatable, even when it goes to an off-kilter place.|Fresh
Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day Lewis, both in peak form, use the fashion world to tackle the agony and euphoria of creation. Taking full measure of Phantom Thread may require more than one viewing. Our advice for now: just sit back and behold.|Fresh
Day-Lewis' declared final performance is perfect, the film less so. Sumptuously made, though, with a score to die for.|Fresh
Daniel Day-Lewis remains our greatest actor. Even if just for one last film.|Fresh
The rhythms are unhurried, the drama pinpoint-intense, the style intimate, the wit Hitchcock-perverse.|Fresh
Daniel Day-Lewis performances are something to be richly savored-and that goes doubly for his turn in Phantom Thread.|Fresh
It's a movie about a rapid change of pace for the artist at its center, and, in its finest moments, that shift feels just as true of its maker.|Fresh
This devilishly funny and luxuriantly sensuous film is so successful as entertainment that it's hard to stop and notice the extreme degree of craft that went into its construction.|Fresh
Even though the tone here is impeccable as a Max Ophüls classic or high-period Bertolucci, you really have to go to something subversive like The War of the Roses to get a hint of the comic blackness.|Fresh
Phantom Thread unfolds so quietly that the questions it's asking about the nature of desire and attraction, and its delicately confrontational back and forth between Alma and Reynolds, may not register immediately.|Fresh
... Phantom Thread is something else, quite welcomely.|Fresh
The filmmaking is so brisk, elegant, witty and surprising; it's a captivating experience.|Fresh
Daniel Day-Lewis' performance in Phantom Thread proves he will be missed from the big screen.|Fresh
"I've never written down the word ""wallpaper"" in my notes so many times in the course of a single film."|Fresh
Could be the filmmaker's most fascinatingly oblique work.|Fresh
Reminds me of Pablo Picasso. Brilliant in its savvy cruelty. Day-Lewis delves deeply into his character's psyche. Best Actor of 2017!|Fresh
Wrapped around the cool and dark character study at the heart of 'Phantom Thread' is some impressively picturesque packaging.|Fresh
Moody and mesmerizing, Paul Thomas Anderson's 1950s-set Phantom Thread may be the first of a genre: the haute-couture gothic. It thrills as an invigorating tale of moribundity.|Fresh
A difficult film, coming close to the abyss and always backing off, keeping catharsis out of reach. But in those difficulties it is sublime.|Fresh
One of the year's very best movies, worth seeing more than once.|Fresh
Phantom Thread is a delightful, sly treat, a cinematic bon bon of malcontented lust and power twisted into a perverted romance.|Fresh
In this twisted love story, chaos and dysfunction are the ties that bind.|Fresh
This is a movie combining gorgeous clothes and food for thought that makes it a must feel and smell, a sumptuous cinematic recipe ripe for the decade in which it's set but one that is weirdly engaging in this one as well.|Fresh
"Not a great time to be releasing a ""He's an abusive jerk, but it's okay because he's a genius!"" movie, but 'The Phantom Thread' does have a little fun with the genre."|Fresh
Like a meticulously crafted dress, it may not move or breathe, but we still marvel at its exquisite craft and stunning design.|Fresh
It's set in an evocative ecosphere of haute couture fashion. But by the time it reaches its appetizingly perverse end, the film primarily reaffirms Anderson's own skill at hand-crafting exquisitely conflicting interior and external worlds.|Fresh
Prickly, sly, entirely exquisite.|Fresh
For Daniel Day-Lewis, I dare call it a perfect fit.|Fresh
Phantom Thread may be modestly subdued in the presentation of its emotions, but they're omnipresent, hanging like a haze over every scene and every terse exchange of dialogue.|Fresh
"An impossible love affair rendered in impeccable detail, ""Phantom Thread"" beguiles as it confounds while articulating a universal truth: Nobody can possibly fathom the inner workings of other people's relationships."|Fresh
"""Phantom Thread"" is the work of a true master"|Fresh
"""Phantom Thread"" won't go down as Day-Lewis' crowning acting achievement, but it showcases just one of numerous other sides to his extraordinary talent..."|Fresh
A duet of affection and irritation, Phantom Thread teeters, too, on the edge of romantic comedy. There's a lot of humor in its passive-aggressive tug-of-war.|Fresh
Reynolds can be so strict because he gets results. If his process is lucrative and acclaimed business, who is anyone to argue he should slow down and be more accommodating?|Fresh
"The director's most outwardly accessible movie in ages, ""Phantom Thread"" is at once an evocative period drama and a magical fable about lonely, solipsistic people finding solace in their mutual sense of alienation."|Fresh
PT Anderson returns with a seductive, deeply dysfunctional love story about a domineering artist and the woman who refuses to come second to his genius.|Fresh
Reynolds mentions that he likes to leave hidden notes and messages stitched into the dresses he creates as a way of forever imbuing that individual garment with a piece of himself; Daniel Day-Lewis does the same in every single one of his performances|Fresh
Anderson has made a strange, entrancing, often darkly funny film that's at once like nothing he's ever made and one no one else could make...|Fresh
What a poor time for the release of Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread, which pushes the narrative that geniuses are on some level allowed to be abusive.|Rotten
Ultimately, what Anderson has given us is the best dramatic film of 2017. Phantom Thread is a haunting and exquisite treatise on the complexity of love.|Fresh
Gorgeous and unpredictable, and maybe a little indulgent, Phantom Thread is another fascinating drama from Paul Thomas Anderson, with captivating lead performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps.|Fresh
Its witty script and eye-candy garments are smoulderingly sinister in the way it packs an emotional punch throughout.|Fresh
We're not so much watching Woodcock the rarefied designer as Day-Lewis the rarefied actor, his immersion so uncanny that he can illuminate a soul at once titanic and stunted.|Fresh
Anderson has produced another sedate, rather passionless look at a subject that continues the filmmaker's recent predilection for making films that are curiously unengaged with the audience on any number of levels.|Rotten
Once again, Day-Lewis goes deep and has clearly done his homework. The 60-year-old actor doesn't seem to know any other way. In an era of tin-plated movie stars, the world of cinema will miss him.|Fresh
There is such pure delicious pleasure in this film, in its strangeness, its vehemence, its flourishes of absurdity, carried off with superb elegance.|Fresh
A challenging watch, but also jaw-dropping on more levels than it's possible to count.|Fresh
In the grand tapestry of Daniel Day-Lewis' acting career, Phantom Thread will be sewn in as a colorful swatch, though for a retirement role, he leaves us wanting a little more.|Fresh
It essentially goes out of style once it hits the runway.|Rotten
"""Feel-good"" is not the sensation Anderson seeks to induce; more like, ""Feel inclined to burn down the movie theater."""|Rotten
...about a muse who uses.|Fresh
Anderson's inclination to stupefy and stir before inevitably satisfying makes Phantom Thread such an immaculate piece of emotional warfare, both for its leading players and its entranced viewers.|Fresh
This feels like the beginning of a different version of this filmmaker: one who's more mature, more confident, more open, and a director who will continue to keep surprising all of us.|Fresh
"While there is precious little overt ""drama"" per se, before you know it you've become happily ensconced in a peculiar world you've never visited or even imagined before."|Fresh
"""Phantom Thread"" is seductive and absorbing, but it's also emotionally remote."|Fresh
This is a movie you'll want to live in for the pure joy of reveling in Paul Thomas Anderson's effortless mastery.|Fresh
"""Phantom Thread"" is as exquisitely crafted as the dresses in the movie... wickedly funny and offers some of the best performances of the year."|Fresh
With Phantom Thread, Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted a delirious, lush, hypnotic, pitch-black comedy.|Fresh
The film arrives at a place of qualified peace that cauterizes the emotional wounds of Paul Thomas Anderson's cinema.|Fresh
Phantom Thread's luxurious but restrained aesthetic perfectly matches Reynolds Woodcock's approach to design.|Fresh
