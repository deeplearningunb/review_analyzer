A friend who watched this with me said that it's the kind of film she'd like to see again when she's dying. That pretty much nails its meditative, melancholy tone...|Fresh

...a film that will live on as the only document of some of Goldsworthy's work.|Fresh

[Riedelsheimer] catches up with Goldsworthy in Leaning Into the Wind, and finds the soft-spoken sculptor still making sublime works of art out of whatever nature throws at him.|Fresh

For many audiences, Riedelsheimer's effort will remain an acquired taste.|Rotten
This movie is a feast. Peel your orbs and dig in!|Fresh

By the documentary's end, the artist and the filmmaker have drawn you into their own meditative rhythms and philosophy.|Fresh
The best way to experience Leaning into the Wind would seem to be in much the same way Goldsworthy experiences the nature that inspires him. Be an attentive watcher and listener - devoid of expectation.|Fresh

A remarkable artist and man, Andy Goldsworthy, in Leaning into the Wind, is given a remarkable cinematic tribute.|Fresh
I will admit that a documentary about art is a hard-sell. But Goldsworthy's work belongs on film the same way Planet Earth belongs in an IMAX theatre. Everything about it, from the opening credits to the final 10 minutes, is captivating.|Fresh
"Specialized filmmaking for art-minded audiences, but much like ""Rivers and Tides,"" there's beauty, craftsmanship, and contemplation for all audiences, returning to a softly-spoken man who craves any chance he receives to put his hands all over the Earth."|Fresh
Delicately documents recent work, from constructing permanent installations to seasonally temporary, and creating ones so fleeting they can only be seen through this film|Fresh
Another creative documentary adventure with the environmental artist.|Fresh
Leaning does not require familiarity with the previous film or Goldsworthy's ephemeral work to be enjoyed.|Fresh
Leaning Into the Wind doesn't always make sense. But with views this beautiful, it doesn't necessarily have to.|Fresh
Riedelsheimer doesn't much go in for save-the-planet urgency, instead putting stock in the grander eloquence of modesty, curiosity, empathy, and awe.|Fresh
Riedelsheimer... gives us the momentary illusion of seeing the world through Goldsworthy's eyes.|Fresh
"If you love nature and all of its wonders and you love art, you must see ""Leaning Into the Wind."" Heck, if you remotely appreciate art, you should see this film."|Fresh
[Thomas] Riedelsheimer also has an artist's eye and approach, so this is less a recording of [Andy] Goldsworthy than a dialogue between his work and that of the filmmaker.|Fresh
Even at its most self-conflicted, this is a fascinating reminder that some art wasn't made to be owned.|Fresh
Certain images are hokey, but Leaning Into the Wind has a wandering, lonely purity. We feel as if we've been allowed to fleetingly swim through Goldsworthy's psyche.|Fresh
"Such pesky details might ruin the meditative worldview of the film; ""Leaning Into the Wind"" asks us to appreciate art for art's sake, and that's not a tough ask at all."|Fresh
Leaning Into the Wind is a study in seeing, in subordinating one's self to the elements, in creating with nature rather than from it.|Fresh
A lovely if overlong snapshot of an artist's mind and eye at work.|Fresh
A nonfiction-focused director and cinematographer frequently attracted to the intersection between artistic expression, nature, and spirituality (however unarticulated), Riedelsheimer is well-matched to Goldsworthy's methods and interests.|Fresh
