A tour de force for Swanson and one of Wilder's better efforts.|Fresh
...They rate a nod for daring, as well as credit for an all-around filmmaking job that, disregarding the unpleasant subject matter, is a standout.|Fresh
One of Wilder's finest, and certainly the blackest of all Hollywood's scab-scratching accounts of itself.|Fresh
Still the best Hollywood movie ever made about Hollywood.|Fresh
What's not recognized enough is the indelible, self-sickened performance of William Holden as Desmond's boy-toy/hired hack.|Fresh
The conception owes something to Miss Havisham in Great Expectations, but the film builds a myth of its own, one that taps into something essential about stardom.|Fresh

An uncompromising study of American decadence displaying a sad, worn, methodical beauty few films have had since the late twenties.|Fresh
Norma is something of a living legend, but she's also an unaware ghost: no longer of the world in which she thinks she lives.|Fresh
A must for fans of ruthless black comedy.|Fresh

Sunset Blvd. is both great entertainment and great literature|Fresh
Tears away at the curtain that keeps reality away from fiction.|Fresh
Many of its featurettes ... benefit hugely from the participation of co-star Nancy Olson.|Fresh

Dark comedy. Film noir. Tragic romance. Hollywood satire. 'Sunset Boulevard' has it all.|Fresh
|Fresh
The casting is perfect.|Fresh
This cold-blooded satire is at once subtle and savage.|Fresh
Gloria Swanson and William Holden give definitive, Oscar-nominated performances as the fading star and hack writer, respectively, in Bily Wilder's darker than dark comedy about the inner workings of Hollywood at a crucial phase of the industry's change.|Fresh
|Fresh
A cynically dark recognition to Hollywood's forgotten stars.|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
A concentration of classic filmmaking at its peak, a specimen of director Billy Wilder at the razor's edge of his brilliance.|Fresh

Marvelous Hollywood-on-Hollywood satire, balanced exquisitely between All About Eve and Mulholland Drive.|Fresh
Black comedy, creepy noir, and timeless Hollywood satire... as good as they come.|Fresh
|Fresh

|Fresh
Magnificent stuff.|Fresh
a then-unprecedented throwing back of the velvet curtain to reveal the exciting, but often sordid and dehumanizing, mechanics that run the Hollywood dream factory|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
|Fresh
A virtually unimpeachable fugue for all manner of Hollywood deaths, those of people, minds, careers, dreams, and baboons.|Fresh
Caustic, scalding, and forever fabulous.|Fresh
Perhaps the best film ever made about Hollywood.|Fresh
|Fresh
This is the greatest film about Hollywood ever put on celluloid by Hollywood.|Fresh
The ultimate depiction of Hollywood burnout|Fresh
|Fresh
The closest thing Wilder made to a horror film (in lighting, score, and character dynamic) after The Lost Weekend.|Fresh
A demented circus of obsession, greed, and Hollywood|Fresh

The best thing about watching old movies is discovering the ones that feel so modern that, with a few touches here and there, barely altering the original product, they could actually fit right in with the quality movies of today.|Fresh

Wilder certainly gives an intimate portrait of Hollywood with all its warts and imperfections.|Fresh
Even as the movie industry grows more and more appalling, Sunset Boulevard just gets better and better.|Fresh
The best film to capture the transitory nature of film fame.|Fresh
Arguably Wilder's best film.|Fresh
While it's not an absolute masterpiece, it has definitely withstood the test of time much more than 96% of its contemporaries, and has some wickedly funny lines to boot.|Fresh
No other motion picture about Hollywood comes near Billy Wilder's searing, uncompromising and utterly fascinating portrait of the film community.|Fresh
Remains the best drama ever made about the movies because it sees through the illusions, even if Norma doesn't.|Fresh
While all the acting is memorable, one always thinks first and mostly of Miss Swanson, of her manifestation of consuming pride, her forlorn despair and a truly magnificent impersonation of Charlie Chaplin.|Fresh
"Sunset Boulevard (1950) is a classic black comedy/drama, and perhaps the most acclaimed, but darkest film-noir story about ""behind the scenes"" Hollywood,"|Fresh
