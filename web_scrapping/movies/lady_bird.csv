Lady Bird is a charming, graceful and humorous story about growing up in a small town.|Fresh
By the time the film wraps up, you'll be filled with a lot of emotion, ranging from nostalgia to relief. Lady Bird is relatable, honest, doesn't take itself seriously and features some charming shots of Sacramento.|Fresh

One element of the film's genius is its ability to root us firmly in Lady Bird's perspective. It does more.|Fresh
Gerwig's future career behind the camera is off to a superb start. Though Lady Bird perhaps lacks that genuine streak of eye-catching innovation, what it does it does extremely well.|Fresh
The story of Lady Bird is accessible to all viewers, perhaps more inclined to the female eye, but one way or another all experience this journey to maturity. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

Restraint ... gives the film its credibility and charm.|Fresh
Its joyful, forward-rushing narrative rhythm captures the feeling of adolescence ending before it has barely begun.|Fresh

Goes without saying this is already a lock for one of the best movies of 2018.|Fresh
While there is an acute authorial intelligence informing the transitions between scenes, the steady trot of clipped vignettes comes to seem monotonous and somewhat evasive, a way to move along before anything too hard and hurtful happens.|Fresh

Gerwig's deft handling of script, camera and actors is all the more impressive given that this is her first film as solo director.|Fresh
Just like its title character, Lady Bird is quirky and sentimental but despite best attempts, never really defines itself into anything meaningful.|Rotten

Gerwig's film moves beyond a traditional coming-of-age 'lessons learned' conclusion, into rather a moving portrait of the intimate ties we have with place.|Fresh
"Lady Bird asks the cinematic question, ""How baller can one movie be?"" And then it answers it emphatically: ""Very baller."""|Fresh
Beautiful coming of age story.|Fresh
evokes a shared sense of adolescent turmoil that is neither melodramatic nor condescending, but rather perfectly pitched at a recognizable human level that allows virtually anyone to identify and empathize with the travails of its protagonist|Fresh

Saiorse Ronan delivers a stellar performance, with Laurie Metcalf as her put-upon mom, and both will likely score Oscar noms along with this instant-classic movie overall.|Fresh
It's that sense that Christine is still a work in progress that makes Lady Bird such an fascinating watch with enough intrigue to make a sequel viable.|Fresh
Gerwig is traveling backwards as a writer from Frances Ha to Mistress America to Lady Bird. That trilogy of films is, dare I say, even better than Francois Truffaut's collected Adventures of Antoine Doinel.|Fresh
Gerwig's movie doesn't say much new about growing up cool with parents who aren't. But it says plenty about Gerwig's talent, another channel for a distinctive voice of her generation.|Fresh
Metcalf gives a prickly and heartbreaking performance, and she's not the only one supplied with grace notes: Almost every character gets one or another.|Fresh
Yet while [Greta] Gerwig doesn't exactly reinvent the coming-of-age genre, she packs it with great scenes, dialogue and performances|Fresh

There are more funny lines in Lady Bird's first five minutes than in most films.|Fresh

It's easily one of the freshest, sharpest and most enjoyable films of this year.|Fresh
'Lady Bird' is as edgy and funny as growing up.|Fresh
Lady Bird is a brilliant little movie that deals with ideas both big and small. But, most powerful is the relationship between Lady Bird and Marion. It is harsh and funny and sometimes hard to watch. But it is undeniably and eternally there.|Fresh
"Though Gerwig's talents as a writer-director shine, it's the casting of Ronan in the lead that makes ""Lady Bird"" such a memorable work. The layers she gives the character will make the performance go down as one of the best high school characters ever."|Fresh
"[VIDEO ESSAY] I suspect that many audiences who return to ""Lady Bird"" will be disappointed as to how the movie stands up. It's a much worse movie the second time around, I promise you."|Rotten
The acting in this movie is really good, especially by Laurie Metcalf, who gives an exceptional performance. It is the film's political metaphor, however, that really lifts it above the standard coming of age movie.|Fresh
... taps into passion and fear on the edge of innocence.|Fresh
A fantastic, female-centric, instant classic reminiscent of both Juno (2007) and Bridesmaids (2011).|Fresh
This is a coming-of-age story like no other thanks to the insightful writing and brisk directorial style of Gerwig, who makes Lady Bird's story a consistently surprising one.|Fresh

Ronan's chemistry with her castmates is always first rate, but her work here with Metcalf is particularly sharp.|Fresh

The characters may be messy, but Gerwig's writing and direction are elegantly precise. One of the best ensemble casts of the year.|Fresh
First-time director Greta Gerwig has created a film that's heartfelt, sometimes heartbreaking and a sure Oscar contender.|Fresh
The key to Lady Bird is that Marion is never painted as an ogre. Her toughness is played for comic effect: as an understandable character flaw born of her genuinely meaning well.|Fresh
A dramedy that will appeal to all women who have experienced large doses of love and pain in their relationships with difficult mothers.|Fresh
While Gerwig has assembled an extraordinary ensemble cast. Ronan has to rate as first among equals.|Fresh
