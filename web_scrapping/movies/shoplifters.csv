The virtues of those who are legally criminals contrasted with the obtuseness of those enforcing the status quo poses a conundrum for the viewer, as well as a bit of cinematic poetry.|Fresh

Another winner from...Hirokazu Kor-eeda. The story in many ways feels Dickensian- like a fresh take on Oliver Twist. I loved every performance.|Fresh

A quiet movie made with absolute confidence and no need to prove itself.|Fresh
Hirokazu Kore-eda's new film is the sleeper hit of 2018. The Japanese filmmaker has become a master of humanity, his films are true reflections of how we as flawed individuals are embraced by those closest to us, family.|Fresh
In the end, perhaps the most frustrating - and devastating - thing about Shoplifters is that if leaves us just as confused about what is right as the characters.|Fresh

Sincere and heartbreaking.|Fresh
The movie shows beauty in the characters' lives without making poverty look idyllic, but it doesn't patronize them either.|Fresh
It is a deeply sad mosaic of good people who are ultimately defined by the bad they've done, whether fairly or not... It remains up to filmmakers like Kore-eda to remind us that people are never this simple.|Fresh
There is one narrative thread that pushes credibility to its limit, but there is more in Shoplifters that resonates and rings true.|Fresh
When it comes to talking about the family, [director Hirokazu Koreeda] takes the cake. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Shoplifters is a masterful film that will have you rethinking the definition of family.|Fresh

It is a carefully and beautifully crafted work that appears to be about one thing (the strong bonds of family life), but is really about something else-the way a city forces us to invent our lives.|Fresh
Like the rest of Kore-eda's canon, Shoplifters is a gently humorous and poignant work of art.|Fresh
The performances, particularly by Sakura Andô as Nobuyo, are incredible and the script is something every writer wishes they wrote themselves.|Fresh
If the family is a natural masterpiece it is almost always a flawed masterpiece.|Fresh
...definitely goes after your heartstrings, yet earns any tears it gets.|Fresh
This movie makes a persuasive argument that it is love, not genetics, that makes a family.|Fresh

A family drama about a clan of grifters evolves into a crime mystery and a devastating indictment not of lawbreakers but of the system that fosters them .|Fresh

About an hour in things begin to unravel, undercutting the audience's assumptions and steadily accumulating great weight and moral severity. By the time it ended I was a wreck.|Fresh
"Overflowing with warmth without lurching into sentimentality, emotional but never manipulative, ""Shoplifters"" asks what makes a family, and how an unorthodox one can survive within the structures of society. (Just don't watch on an empty stomach.)"|Fresh
Shoplifters is an astonishing, heartbreaking film that offers no easy answers to the questions that it raises.|Fresh
It's in theory the worst family movie of 2018 - and in practice one of the year's best films.|Fresh
Kore-eda's script is laced with small moments of affection to build a story so utterly grounded by love that the novelty of the crimes they commit feels secondary.|Fresh
What makes it such an enrapturing experience is the tenderness, humour and detail [director Hirokazu] Kore-eda brings to his material.|Fresh
"Another Kore-eda tale of hard-pressed individuals struggling to live ""normal"" lives in spite of it all. Get out your handkerchiefs."|Fresh
The entire cast is phenomenal, with a lived-in chemistry.|Fresh
The spirits of the old masters pervade this disquieting but deeply moving drama. But Kore-eda stands alone as the chronicler of family life in a country facing an identity crisis.|Fresh
For Kore-eda, money unavoidably gives reliance on each other the appearance of abuse, even in the eyes of the kindest shoplifter. Doubt takes over, and the herd disperses into lonely wolves, aggressive because they are scared of getting hurt again.|Fresh
conveys the messy, boisterous joy of three generations sharing and caring in close quarters and the ofttimes harsh residuals of justice.|Fresh
Delicately observed and perfectly played, it's consummate, flawless film-making.|Fresh

This is a film with no set pieces or major plot twists but it is wholly absorbing and it will steal your heart.|Fresh

What really makes this special is the sheer depth of compassion and knowing humanity behind every frame.|Fresh
Shoplifters tells a deceptively simple story that gradually reveals layers ... about its characters, their pasts, their relationships, and how ... we connect as people.|Fresh
When the story eventually takes a turn for sensational, Kore-eda keeps the action low-key, emphasizing the emotional responses of the family members rather than the external forces that close in around them.|Fresh
The brilliance of the film comes from the way Koreeda quietly and non-judgmentally observes this clan up close as they care for and look out for one another before gradually pulling back to reveal the true nature of their various relationships.|Fresh
A spirited, lilting delight.|Fresh
Beautifully played by the whole cast, from the five Shibatas to the tiny Sasaki as Yuri to even the bit actors with one line, this is, as Koreeda hoped, all about family, in whatever form it might take.|Fresh
This wise and insightful film is delicate, poignant and unexpectedly powerful.|Fresh

This is so beautifully observed that cast members never seem to be acting.|Fresh

Members of a family living on state support are not what they seem in an award-winning drama from Hirokazu Kore-eda.|Fresh
Not only is it warmly accessible thanks to the pulsing humanity of its performances, but its story goes far beyond tender-hearted social realism into darker and more morally challenging territory.|Fresh
Kore-eda, in his steady and unhectoring way, is levelling grave accusations at Japanese social norms, yet what stays with you, unforgettably, is that bundle of mixed souls at the start.|Fresh
Both a gentle examination of what constitutes a real family and a harsh dissection of Japan's faltering social landscape.|Fresh
This ragtag Japanese family is so charming you might hope the shoplifters will never get caught.|Fresh
Hirokazu Kore-eda imbues his characters with so much empathy, no matter what they do (and some of it is quite questionable), you don't judge them, you understand.|Fresh

If there is a cinematic equivalent of comfort food, Koreeda's movies are it and Shoplifters is one of the best examples.|Fresh
The ending breaks the heart and makes you think hard about the ties that bind us.|Fresh
The well laid out setup-rickety home, poor neighborhood and lively clan who lives off their grandma's gov't check-makes you think their brushes with the law and experiences with irate shopkeepers will lead somewhere. It doesn't.|Rotten
Deceptively profound and filled with great performances, Shoplifters is yet another Kore-eda triumph.|Fresh
In true Kore-eda fashion the film is quietly devastating, slowly accumulating an avalanche of emotions that climaxes in a beautiful sequence.|Fresh
"""Maybe the bond is stronger when you choose your family,"" says someone, and darned if the film doesn't make a good case for that notion."|Fresh

Kore-eda is a masterful storyteller. Just as we're complacent and pleased with how this peculiar family goes on, secrets begin to spill... Layer by layer we're led into stark, riveting realism.|Fresh
Kore-eda navigates this reality with a graceful perceptiveness, a subtle humor, and an inspired precision that never compromises the humanity of his subjects.|Fresh

It's complex, touching...a fine art.|Fresh
A compact masterpiece about a scruffy family that isn't what it seems, and love that's the real thing.|Fresh
Sometimes, the films of the Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda remind me of the novels of Paul Auster, deceptively simple prose that builds slowly into a puzzle piece of quietly explosive force.|Fresh
For the bulk of 'Shoplifters,' Kore-eda works in a beautiful register that feels both detailed and genuine at the same time.|Fresh
As this apparently amoral group reveals its collective heart, Shoplifters gets richer and warmer, building to an ending that's no less powerful for being so very small.|Fresh
Shoplifters is so gently observed and generous and careful with its characters that when misfortune finally befalls this family group, it's almost unbearable to watch.|Fresh
In Shoplifters, writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda dramatizes the insidious and relativistic ordinariness of poverty.|Fresh
Sex, love, puberty and even death are all handled with a refreshing level of honesty, never letting a life lesson become a big moment, but rather another step in growing up, a true reflection on the way real life works.|Fresh
Koreeda provides us with another exemplary portrait of hopeful people in hopeless situations.|Fresh
Shoplifters is built on an outrageously melodramatic plot, but in Kore-eda's hands, it comes off as natural, touching and genuine.|Fresh

Kore-eda, who trained as a documentary filmmaker and once aspired to be a novelist, inserts lines that illuminate and pierce, while masterfully building to a climax stronger in reflection than the moment.|Fresh
"Kore-eda's gentle drama about a made-up ""family"" of thieves living on the margins of society is shot through with the director's trademark generosity and attention to behavior."|Fresh
Another charming, funny and very affecting example of Kore-eda's special brand of tough-but-tender humanism.|Fresh
Pinpointing the bottom of society and finding in supposedly the worst of Japan that which in fact makes it best.|Fresh
A worthy winner of the 2018 Palme d'Or, this is a compassionate and complicated love letter to family and the secrets and lies which accompany them.|Fresh
In a less composed director's hands, this would be sentimental guff. Here, it's potent.|Fresh
Shoplifters showcases one of the modern cinema's great empaths deploying compassion like a time-delay nerve agent; this is Koreeda's expansive humanism, weaponised.|Fresh
In an impeccable alchemy, [director Hirokazu] Koreeda mixes [the film's] ingredients: the legal, the ethical, the emotional, the blood ties. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Who better than Kore-eda, a director who whispers instead of shouts, is able to capture contradictions and issues though such a subtle, unforced style of storytelling?|Fresh
Shoplifters is compassionate, socially conscious filmmaking with a piercing intelligence that is pure Kore-eda. This is a film that steals in and snatches your heart.|Fresh
We are confronted with a steely critique of society's (and humanity's) failings - one not seen in the director's work, with this level of clarity, since his quietly devastating 2004 work Nobody Knows.|Fresh
