In short, Beast is a psychological thriller with smarts and sharp fangs that is a cut above most takes on a classic, undeniably appealing story.|Fresh
The tonal shift undoes what amounts to one of the more interesting origins of a serial killer in the making. A thriller without much thrills, Beast is a thought-provoking character study and sort of a dark fairy tale.|Rotten
The kind of cinematic experience that burrows into you.|Fresh
Beast is a compelling character study thanks to Jessie Buckley's performance, despite the fact that it struggles to reach its goals due to director Michael Pearce's overzealous direction and some story contrivances and problems.|Fresh
This moody slow-burn from writer-director Michael Pearce is a psychosexual tone-poem of quiet desperation.|Fresh
An incredibly forced and sophomoric drama. The plot is rushed, almost as if Pearce is trying too transparently to end-gain all the ideas and thematic intent of his scenario.|Rotten
Jessie Buckley's luminous performance drives the psychosocial thriller.|Fresh
A film like this could've popped with a more elegant approach, keeping things stark without losing the sinister edge that both Jessie Buckley and Johnny Flynn bring to this through their fantastic performances.|Rotten
Beast is an interesting story and a firm first step in the British filmmaker's promising career. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Writer-director Michael Pearce's debut feature is a chilling little thriller reminiscent of recent low-key contemporary horrors like Raw, Get Out and the little-seen In Fear.|Fresh
It's compelling, and admirably avoids genre trappings, but while Beast occasionally seems poised to become something truly great, it never quite gets there.|Fresh
Gamey, strange and fresh.|Fresh
Beast is a skilful debut from Pearce and a mostly satisfying example of suspense created out of mundane incidents and everyday events.|Fresh
This is a film of some power, and one that doesn't flinch from following its more disturbing implications through to the end.|Fresh
This is still worth catching for the strong work from James, the frightening Flynn, and Buckley, who's obviously destined for big things, even if her role could well disturb Hollywood's casting agents.|Fresh
Shifting from wounded vulnerability to an increasingly animalistic rage, [Jessie Buckley] gives this gothic horror story an unexpectedly potent bite.|Fresh
An outsider love story, a chilly whodunit, a psychological thriller-Beast is all and none of these.|Fresh
Though it's somewhat vintage now, it remains exhilarating and emotionally effective storytelling. For a fan of the genre, Beast is not to be missed.|Fresh
Beast is a strikingly shot, cleverly scripted, unsettling study of troubled psychology in the pressure-cooker claustrophobia of a small island.|Fresh
When the film is in full swing, that is exploring Moll's family life, it's an alluring study.|Fresh
An edgy arthouse psychological/sexual thriller.|Fresh
This tale of beasts and beauty claws through appearances, expectations, and the fine line between inviting and troubling - and victim and attacker - on a plethora of levels.|Fresh
A naked expression of female emotion [is] what forms the dark centre of this flawed but fascinating film.|Fresh
An exploration of just how flimsy the boundary is between man and animal, Beast is a thriller with a nasty bite.|Fresh
Beast is a psychological thriller with terrific acting.|Fresh
Definitely a dangerous bone for a date movie, but a good gnaw for those who seek a dark theatre and a cloudy sky in summer.|Fresh
Pearce cleverly steers us into this dark drama Moll-first.|Fresh
It's not a bad movie, but it's precisely the sort of middling genre exercise with which we are culturally oversaturated at the moment. And Pearce doesn't do anything to make Beast stand out from the pack.|Rotten
Sensational. Buckley and Flynn are sensational. Skip the comic book movies and see BEAST. This film stays with you.|Fresh
Pearce is a master at building unnerving ambiguity into scenes that can be interpreted multiple ways, keeping us guessing into the last possible second.|Fresh
Yes, well, in any case, the film's dramatic set-up and performances are gripping, but it gets progressively soapy and -- at 147 minutes -- makes for a rather burdensome Beast.|Fresh
Pearce tells his story of a serial killer through the peripheral what-ifs of a couple as believably uninvolved in the carnage as its possible creators.|Fresh
Beast is often bleak, sometimes beautiful and occasionally baffling. And while your expectations, or lack thereof, will ultimately decide how fulfilling you'll find the film, it's worth it just for the lead performance.|Fresh
For his impressive debut feature, writer-director Michael Pearce crafts an eerie mood of unspecified menace in which anything might happen, and anyone might be capable of the most heinous actions.|Fresh
While not gratuitous or gory, Beast won't be everyone's cuppa. But it's a really memorable debut by Pearce - and maybe even more so for Buckley.|Fresh
The pas-de-deux between Moll and Pascal has a rare emotional register due primarily to Jessie Buckley's astonishing and frightening performance as Moll.|Fresh
A little like Nicholas Ray's great film noir In a Lonely Place (1950), where we watch Humphrey Bogart begin a romance with Gloria Grahame while he's under suspicion for murder-except that Beast shows us the dynamic from the female perspective.|Fresh
Self-assured and finely-wrought...along with its atmospherics, the film's strength comes from its excellent casting.|Fresh
It's both intoxicating and claustrophobic-a swirling vortex of desire and denial that exposes the wildness behind our most controlled exteriors.|Fresh
Strong performances push the story along; it's not so much about solving a mystery as it is about inner turmoil and the stories we tell ourselves, be they fairy tales or not.|Fresh
The film's outcomes are never framed, at least for the audience, in terms of morality. What Beast asks us is to consider whether or not there's light to be found in darkness -- and vice versa.|Fresh
It's the story of the beauty and the beast, but you will not know who is who, until the end... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Passes the Bechdel Test with flying colors, and keeps you guessing as to who the title character really is.|Fresh
Suffice it to say, there is a good deal for Buckley to do, and she does it. In a year of memorable and unnerving female characters, she makes Moll stand out.|Fresh
The film's refusal to obey genre rules can be as disorienting as it is refreshing.|Fresh
It's difficult to say that the script fully gets into the head of either Moll or Pascal, but rest assured Beast is a thrilling crowdpleaser sure to have viewers unsure of where the dynamic is going until the final shot|Fresh
Beast is a breed of its own, a gritty psychological-mystery with a brilliantly dark, pulsating and atmospheric heart.|Fresh
Even if it has B-movie trappings and the tension wanes in the second half, it's a stylish psychodrama.|Fresh

With the assured script and deft direction from Pearce, along with Buckley's complex and nuanced performance, we never know what's actually going on in her head.|Fresh
Aided and abetted by Benjamin Kracun's alluringly sensual cinematography, Mr. Pearce has created a feverish fairy tale riven with dark horrors and forbidden desires.|Fresh
[Jessie] Buckley is simply wonderful as Moll, giving a fearless, totally committed performance.|Fresh
The concept needed Polanski circa Knife In The Water and Repulsion, and while this is a promising debut, Pearce is nowhere near that level yet.|Rotten
Despite starting strong, this psychosexual thriller is at once ham-fisted, obvious and all-too-frequently preposterous.|Rotten
Writer-director Pearce, making his feature debut, proves dedicated to a psychological naturalism.|Fresh
A well developed thriller with horror undertones.|Fresh

Jessie Buckley is a force of nature in the lead role of this sinewy psychological thriller.|Fresh
