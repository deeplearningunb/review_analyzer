Living with Linklater's characters as they explore life, unsupervised, without inhibition, engages the heart and takes you back to a freewheeling, optimistic state of mind and body that many of us let go of a long time ago.|Fresh
It's a rare director that can revisit a formula that he aced more than two decades ago and still manage to deliver something fresh, let alone fun.|Fresh
Linklater's a genius at concretising what are almost intangible sentiments and in tapping into a certain temporal truth about life.|Fresh
The comedy comes from a place of reality and even when said reality is heightened, Linklater does it in a way that rolls off your back.|Fresh
The cast is energetic and spry, lighting up the screen with their charisma and having a ball with Linklater's naturalistic dialogue. Their characters are all distinctive and entertaining, and you get the sense that you know them when all is said and done.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! brings Linklater's lackadaisical, narcotic strut at its highest potency to a Texas college baseball team in the heart of the '80s.|Fresh
I can't remember the last time I smiled through an entire film.|Fresh
A hilarious slice of life, a meandering journey to nowhere much, packed with great dialogue and memorable characters.|Fresh
Will (hopefully) take you back to your own long, hot, salad days at school or college. A sunny delight.|Fresh
Linklater is deft with actors and keeps things light.|Fresh

Linklater is deft with actors and keeps things light.|Fresh
The greatest strength of the movie might be that it makes you actually want to be around people you most likely would hate interacting with otherwise|Fresh
It's a sports comedy that's more along the lines of Animal House.|Fresh
It's an effective piece of period-Americana, well-acted by a likeable ensemble cast.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! is a funny, light-hearted movie about the last days of summer. It's a nostalgic look back at a halcyon time.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some offers a return to the Dazed and Confused mode of storytelling, lighter and meandering fare that finds real intimacy in the unfettered high times of life before adulthood sets in.|Fresh
[Everybody Wants Some!!!] is an eventually enjoyable movie that I almost walked out of.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! is an exuberant exploration of the excitement and challenges that come with finding yourself in college. It notably succeeds in promoting a positive, healthy form of masculinity...|Fresh
Richard Linklater's latest, Everybody Wants Some!!, is so terrible, so utterly disappointing that I actually came up with four leads for this review (Now, that's a severely miffed critic).|Rotten
It's like a sex comedy you might have come out of in the 1980s thinking, 'That was weirdly smart for a dumb teen movie.'|Fresh
While Everybody Wants Some!! isn't a great movie, there is something comforting about its predictability, self-awareness, and ability to basically recapture the plot of every single end-of-school-year/beginning-of-school-year teen/early 20s storyline.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some is nothing more than Dazed and Confused's empty cousin.|Rotten
There is a lot of fun and laughter to be had here, and I guarantee you'll come out of the theatre smiling.|Fresh
Party on, dudes! With tracks from Blondie, Van Halen, Sugar Hill Gang, The Cars and more, Linklater's frat-pack com is an absolute blast. Prepare to be amazed and amused.|Fresh
Linklater presents a time in life, a few days, showing it up for what it is: a laugh while it's happening, its specific events likely soon forgotten, but no less significant for it.|Fresh
Likeable, inconsequential comedy ramble about an assortment of baseball jocks who share a frat house at a Texas college.|Fresh
At last, a proper summery hit.|Fresh
For the most part, Everybody Wants Some!! is a shambling, rambling look at young people who have yet to become interesting. Judging by the movie, they may never actually achieve that status.|Rotten
Pointlessness is an important element in a Linklater film, but this one never is able to make much of a purpose for itself.|Rotten
It's all a bit of a bro'verdose.|Rotten
Honestly, it's pretty compelling.|Fresh
Frat-boy jocks usually get a bad rap in movies (filmmakers tend not to be former jocks). Yet Linklater captures his characters' bantering camaraderie and boozy machismo with disarming sympathy.|Fresh
The movie respects its audience in a way few of these coming-of-age comedies ever do, and while not a home run for Linklater, it's still a solid triple off the wall I'm certain to still be cheering for throughout the remainder of 2016.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some, like Dazed and Confused, feels like having old friends over, listening to records & reminiscing.|Fresh
Films about brotherhood come in many forms, yet rare do they capture the connection of different personalities with the engrossing, free spirited tone that Linklater does here.|Fresh
Linklater offers astute observations about college life and young adults exploring their first taste of independence while reminding us that there's more on their minds than just getting some!!|Fresh
Richard Linklater's rowdy, sensual party odyssey is accorded a sturdy transfer that's in dire need of a few evocative extras.|Fresh
Linklater proves his skills directing actors. Everyone is great in the film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
while there is inherent diversity among these players, there is so much about them that is the same in terms of personality, desires, and ideologies that we start longing to get out of their world and into someone else's|Rotten
Richard Linklater's Everybody Wants Some!! is delightful fun, a 1980s college romp complete with sex and offbeat hijinks.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! may seem to set about without a purpose or direction, but under writer/director Richard Linklater's guidance, it becomes a rather entertaining character piece mixed together with a delightful nostalgia trip.|Fresh
There's no such thing as an ungenerous Linklater film, but Everybody Wants Some!! is high in the running for the most generous yet.|Fresh
The film is careful not to judge or praise these characters.|Fresh
Simple, and down to Earth in scope and vision, but brings with it an incredible series of rich and complex characters...|Fresh
Cinema in its purest form, and the film doesn't even try to brag about it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The spirit of Dazed and Confused goes to the 80s. Relaxed, charming and unforgettable. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
We need more movies like this. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's no storyline. The script just drifts from one vignette to the next as the boys cruise around, ogling girls, haunting the campus night spots and staging a party while their house does its best to remain standing under their assaults.|Fresh
Here we have a celebration of male camaraderie and masculinity that comes at the expense of no one, a sex comedy that is both sexy and comedic.|Fresh
"The film is set in 1980, the lads all want to ""get some"" - sex - and the film's politics are no more advanced than those of Porky's (1981) - which is, incidentally, a better movie, and has the benefit of looking more comfortable in its own period clothes."|Rotten
Linklater's 1980 is a world that's so perfect in its contours, so detailed in its realisation, and quite delightful to inhabit for two hours.|Fresh
Shaggy and loose (unlike the characters' shorts)... There are worse groups to hang with.|Fresh
Despite its easygoing spirit, Everybody is tightly structured, framed by four parties and a countdown clock to the start of classes. For a movie that's pretty much about nothing, it's incredibly well-paced and never overstays its welcome.|Fresh
Special mention should go to the Everybody Want Some!! hair and make-up department -- the lead actors' retro look is so convincing, you'd swear you were watching a documentary.|Fresh
If you feel a sigh of nostalgia for the era and what you were doing or being at the time, maybe you would get a bigger hit from the film than I.|Rotten
There is something infectious about the spontaneity on display as it captures the joys of self-discovery, exploring life and having fun. If we could only bottle that feeling!|Fresh
This is a riot of a movie, drenched in sunny naivete and paced at an open, lackadaisical beat.|Fresh
Linklater and his largely unknown ensemble of actors capture the true essence of these hazy, halcyon days with great humour, heart and warmth.|Fresh
It's as if Linklater is bound by a bro code that obliges him to present these guys in a basically uncritical light.|Rotten
Linklater has audaciously made a movie about our most maligned subset of young men -- bros -- and forced us to admit that we actually like them.|Fresh
Pleasingly aimless, often hilarious .|Fresh
There's none of the humiliating gross-out humour that dominates modern teen comedy, giving the film an affable, breezy appeal -- although, as often happens in Linklater-land, apparently light-hearted scenes are tinged with violence.|Fresh
"Richard Linklater loosely follows on from two of his most acclaimed films with this lively university comedy set in 1980. It's billed as a ""spiritual sequel"" to his high school classic Dazed and Confused, which was set in the late 1970s."|Fresh
An unassuming, soft-centred delight.|Fresh
A hugely enjoyable ode to the value of hanging out at the one time in your life where you're free from both the constraints of high school and the pressures of proper adulthood.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! is obsessed with seduction. Don't let me stop you going all the way with Linklater. I'm just here to warn you that, with regards to this film, he doesn't go very deep.|Fresh
The picture works best if you reserve judgment - yes, some of the attitudes towards women are a little unreformed and some of the characters are puddle deep - and enjoy the show.|Fresh
Mr Linklater may be a fan of Marcel Proust, because this film is suffused with a heady nostalgia for the lost past.|Fresh
The magic of Linklater's detailed, conversational piece... is in the performances (brilliant and, occasionally, affectionate) and the dialogue (sharp and endlessly witty).|Fresh
The dialogue is witty, the sense of period is spot on and there is also a vulnerability beneath the bluster and bravado of young men enjoying the time of their lives.|Fresh
Sweet, honest and, most of all, richly enjoyable.|Fresh
Put on your party shirt, grab a brew, and waste some precious time.|Fresh
Pacey and completely entertaining, this comedy rocks.|Fresh
There is much to enjoy, especially for those of us who were also students back then - albeit a long way from Texas.|Fresh
Linklater's non-judgemental observations of thoughtfully unpredictable characters do, though, make it linger in the mind.|Fresh
After his intimate, generation-spanning epic Boyhood, Richard Linklater is back with an equally special and magical film, albeit one with a much tighter focus.|Fresh
Linklater is too besotted with his male creations to see that they can be divided almost without exception between the bland and the obnoxious. Even his usual eye for detail is a little off.|Rotten
I was fed up of them all by the end, I have to say.|Rotten
The look of the film - hair, costumes, even sunlight - is exactly right. The sound of it is even better. Music constantly plays from ubiquitous car stereos and turntables, and every scene has its own groove.|Fresh
For someone humming much the same tune from film to film, Linklater has an amazing versatility.|Fresh
A deceptively subtle comedy, and also a challengingly and almost provokingly unironic film intensifying and cartoonifying what it is like to be young and male ...|Fresh
Serving up a heady combination of laugh-out-loud humour, likeable characters and powerful nostalgia, this is a treat from start to finish.|Fresh
It scores a few runs with its engaging characters and spicy dialogue but does not swing for the long ball, as it's content to just score enough to win.|Fresh
A joyous and often uproarious portrayal of college-age adolescence and the alluring freedom that brings.|Fresh
All this whacky mirth, mayhem and lack of plot could irritate all of us over 25s were the team all mere meatheads. Thankfully they're not... they're a witty, articulate bunch.|Fresh
I generally can't sustain thoughts about Linklater's work. I only retain a general sense of having periodically wasted hours of my life that I'm never getting back.|Rotten
"The film's slyly profound tagline reads, ""Here for a good time. Not a long time."" Subtext: enjoy it while it's here, because it'll be gone before you know it."|Fresh
Some will balk at the macho sexism that runs rife, but Linklater perfectly captures the lust for life that accompanies those early college days. It's magical.|Fresh
Linklater has crafted another star-free, period drama that perfectly recreates the spirit of a year and the age of its characters.|Fresh
The jocks in Linklater's film are miles apart from today's frat movie characters; these are mostly clever, curious and likeable, their camaraderie given a tender spin by Linklater.|Fresh
"The ""some"" that everybody wants here is plainly sex, but the gang engages in enough undergraduate philosophizing to suggest that they're hoping to get more than just laid."|Fresh
Linklater's typically fluid, relaxed direction makes it a pleasure to spend time in the company of these characters.|Fresh
Every conflict is undercut with a breezy reassurance that college is awesome!!|Rotten
Richard Linklater shows that the best thing about being American -- or more specifically, a middle-class Texan -- is that you get to choose your tribe when you come of age.|Fresh
"The aim of ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is to mirror the warm feelings that come with a good beer buzz. And for that, there are few better options."|Fresh
I often feel like the only movie characters more tedious than Linklater's leads were played by Zeppo Marx.|Rotten
It's the likable cast that will bring constant smiles to the faces of anyone who remembers the freedoms of being young and enjoying them unabashedly.|Fresh
It may be slight, but it's also very funny, occasionally insightful, and a welcome throwback to those hallowed school daze.|Fresh
"[Linklater's] trademark introspection makes ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" funny and affecting, if familiar. When you're dealing with nostalgia, that's not such a terrible thing."|Fresh
Many of Mr. Linklater's fans or other moviegoers nostalgic for an Animal House-style homage to college testosterone may find plenty of appeal in all that.|Fresh
The movie is good fun, with Linklater's trademark dizzy, sparkling R-rated dialogue and, like Dazed and Confused 23 years ago, a soundtrack chock full of nostalgic 1980s rock 'n' roll.|Fresh
The maverick Texas filmmaker throws a wild party that's also a sneakily deep look back at a time when everything appeared possible.|Fresh
Linklater still knows how to depict the young person's quest to find his or her own purpose in the world, a meaning beyond themselves, and communion with another human soul. This is why he remains a treasure of American cinema.|Fresh
Despite Linklater's best efforts the movie goes nowhere because the narrative is pretty much non-existent.|Rotten
Everybody Wants Some!! is a highly entertaining production that's easily as good as its title is bad.|Fresh
If this project is some kind of huge in-joke, I'm willing to admit I didn't get it. But if I did get it (and I'm afraid I did), it's a huge disappointment.|Rotten
A perfectly pitched blast of nostalgia, which will transport you to that time in life when the future stretched before you and anything seemed possible.|Fresh
"In trying to recapture one of his greatest creative successes, Linklater goes too slack. I'm sure ""Everybody Wants Some"" was fun to make, but it's a chore to sit through."|Rotten
Sharp, funny, and infectiously nostalgic. Everybody Wants Some!! is filled with moments where you relate to the youthful, carefree spirit Linklater so carefully evokes.|Fresh
You'll have as much fun deciding on a favorite bit of dialogue or scene as you do choosing a favorite character.|Fresh
It still comes off as another unique entry in the Linklater canon in its careful balancing of full-on machismo-filled bro-down comedy with more tender scenes of genuine male bonding.|Fresh
reminds us just how unrivaled a filmmaker Linklater is-how, like few other filmmakers, he's someone you can grow up with and alongside, watching him watch you.|Fresh
"I was finally won over in the last act, when Everybody Wants Some! turns a little emotional, a little ""girly."""|Fresh
Two hours of watching college jocks pursuing fun with frenzied abandon.|Rotten
In trying to reconstruct a specific time and place, Linklater doesn't drive the story forward. He even inserts a timer between scenes to count down the hours before classes start, which only underscores the missing tension in the narrative.|Rotten
A really enjoyable period comedy that perfectly captures small-town college life through Linklater's nostalgia-tinted glasses.|Fresh
"Sophomoric, a real regression from the ambition of ""Boyhood"""|Rotten
[Linklater's] skeptical but essentially optimistic view of human nature shines almost effortlessly on Everybody Wants Some!!|Fresh
...intimately genial, like a platonic pat on the butt.|Fresh
The two films share a vibe, an approach, which is shaggy, giggly, and loose-limbed. They're both hangout movies, in the best possible sense.|Fresh
Not much happens, but the movie's got a great affection for its jock characters and a wonderful flow.|Fresh
... as playfully raunchy as any sex comedy doubling down on exclamation points can be. Like its kindred predecessor, it's also wise about basically good people being dazed and very confused.|Fresh
What everybody wants in Everybody Wants Some!! is not just sex and success on the field. It's what we all want. It's time.|Fresh
"We don't get an unhinged conclusion like ""Animal House,"" but, at the same time, there is very little edge to the movie."|Fresh
A pleasant enough and charming if decidedly adult diversion that's likely going to be the springboard for launching one or more new Hollywood star careers. (Full Content Review for Parents -- Violence, Profanity, etc. -- Also Available)|Fresh
You can practically smell the stale beer in Everybody Wants Some!! But do we really wanna drink it?|Rotten
It's consistently hilarious for its entire two hours, but it isn't just jokes-there's outstanding character work here, too. (Splice Today)|Fresh
At once brilliantly structured and seemingly effortless.|Fresh
With laid-back ease and an organic understanding of characters and dialogue, Richard Linklater (Boyhood) has crafted an excellent, breezy comedy.|Fresh
It's almost an anthropological study: a tribe in its native habitat - batting practice, bar fights, babes (or so they hope, obsessively).|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! is a terrifically entertaining movie that proves Linklater once again a master of perfectly capturing moments in time without judgment or apology.|Fresh
Deliriously gleeful...a sort of cinematic kegger, loose, informal and not a little ragged, that reminds you in a penetrating but not hectoring way of what it was like to be young and full of possibility.|Fresh
The whole thing feels like a fond reminiscence conducted under the influence of some blissful chemical that allows you to remember things the way they should have been.|Fresh
A surefire mood-booster. Destined to become a cult-classic, with a top notch cast.|Fresh
Linklater balances the wistful glow of memory with a quick-witted script, a tremendous young cast, and a vibe of effortless cool that has defined his filmmaking career.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! is the rare sort of raunchy American comedy that allows as much time for scenes of people simply talking as it does for mud-wrestling matches and bar brawls|Fresh
Linklater's singularity as a director lies in his sympathy for his characters: He likes them all, no matter how flawed.|Fresh
I admire Richard Linklater, but anyone who fixates on memories like these suffers from a case of arrested development. It all looks like old reruns of dated TV sitcoms, like Welcome Back, Kotter.|Rotten
The best movie of the year (so far) ... the perfect kick-back-and-chill movie, a combo of fastball jokes and unexpected wisdom backed by a 1980s jukebox.|Fresh
When you look back on this comedy of jock manners... you marvel at how economically Linklater has wafted you along, using little more than breezy moods, plotless good spirits, and the rhythms of an encyclopedically eclectic pop sound track.|Fresh
Though it's a super accurate rendering of the time period it portrays, the picture is also universal in its appeal.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! is about the moment when youth culture began to evolve into a cult of team players. It taps into how the freewheeling '70s gave way to a spirit of creeping conformism.|Fresh
In a world full of toxic masculinity, of #notallmen a-holes and GamerGate creeps, Everybody Wants Some!! is a welcome reminder that being a man isn't inherently bad.|Fresh
An art-house Animal House.|Fresh
"Linklater barely puts a foot wrong, and he shows that a movie about happiness can be cogent and robust, rather than sappy or wispy; and yet, for all its gambolling mischief, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" leaves us with plenty to rue."|Fresh
"Richard Linklater's collegiate comedy ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a two-exclamation-point romp."|Fresh
Unfortunately, [Blake] Jenner's screentime mostly consists of a lack of spatial awareness and poor, unemotive line readings.|Rotten
... weaves broad and formulaic elements into a celebration of nostalgia that resonates with authenticity.|Fresh
It's Linklater in a nostalgic mood-but also his most deeply felt piece of growing up.|Fresh
this being Linklater, there are many insights into just what it means to find one's path in life even if the only route his characters seek is the quickest to the next beer, bong or booty.|Fresh
A sporadically amusing, if unconvincing, film eager to imagine jocks as horndogs with hearts of gold.|Rotten
If you look past the laughs, partying and hijinks, you will see that Linklater is going for something more; a philosophy of being in the present and not trying too hard to figure out your entire life when you are only 18.|Fresh
Before Midnight convinced us that Linklater had become one of the most emotionally mature filmmakers of his generation. With Everybody Wants Some!!, he has a lame midlife crisis.|Rotten
The cast of slightly known actors also works to the film's favor. All play their part on the well-balanced roster.|Fresh
Dazed and Confused meets Before Sunrise, an Animal House for a new generation.|Fresh
"""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era."|Fresh
Timeless, engaging but a little rough around the edges, it's not quite one of Linklater's best but it's something special.|Fresh
It's an effortless cult classic, delivered by a master of the form, and one of the first truly must-see movies of 2016.|Fresh
...for now, as the song says, let the good times roll.|Fresh
Even looser than its predecessor. Its non-story is sometimes talky and bland, and your tolerance for guy stuff may well be tested.|Rotten
It's hard to imagine another filmmaker who could invest the lives of straight, middle-class, norm-y, aggressively bro-y, immaculately groomed college sports jocks with a sense of vital anarchy and resounding humanity.|Fresh
The music is authentic, but to steal an SAT analogy, the characters are to real students as the chorus line in South Pacific was to real sailors: caricatures created to tell us things we already know about the virtues and deficits of callow youth.|Rotten
So much fun that it is easy to overlook how sweet it is and how smart it is.|Fresh
[Everybody Wants Some!!] is so good-natured and sweet, so confident in its understanding of time and place, so unrelentingly funny, you won't want to leave.|Fresh
It captures a specific time, with its goofball moustaches and too-tight tees, clearly but without any drippy nostalgia.|Fresh
"The film - which is being marketed as ""a spiritual sequel"" to Linklater's Dazed And Confused (and a ""more chill"" Animal House by the director himself) - meanders from minor adventure to minor adventure, with exchanges of amiable dude existentialism."|Fresh
I kept pulling away from the whole thing, admiring as always Linklater's skilled direction of the ongoing bull session but concluding soon enough that bull was all the movie had to offer.|Rotten
Loose-jointed and endearing ...|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! presents a string of moments, unhindered by something as unnecessary as a plot but connected by the inescapable routine of college life.|Fresh
Richard Linklater's non-sequel of a sequel to Dazed and Confused has pitch-perfect tone.|Fresh
Linklater loves to just chill with his characters, and he makes us want to chill with them, too.|Fresh
Richard Linklater's idea of a baseball movie is one where the first pitch isn't thrown until the 90-minute mark.|Fresh
its own brand of smart, fun sociological observation|Fresh
"As small and specific as it is, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" feels improbably expansive, even universal."|Fresh
At his best, Linklater gives the characters the space for quietly revealing moments.|Fresh
This is Linklater at his best, recalling the relatively recent past intimately and with obvious affection, and, of course, with one hell of a killer soundtrack. I want some more.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! captures the essence of all sorts of youthful desires, both those that are easily identifiable and the more aching, unnameable kind.|Fresh
Linklater somehow succeeds in showing just how sex-obsessed young men are at this age, without softening or sentimentalizing them, or making them obnoxious.|Fresh
"Linklater approaches all of this with affection, and even kindness-one of his distinguishing characteristics. ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a corrective to the tired, false ""dumb jock"" stereotype."|Fresh
I worried I'd be disappointed by Everybody Wants Some!!, even though one of my favorite directors made it. But I loved it.|Fresh
"Consider ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" as both a fond exercise in remembrance and a movie that, at its best, works for people of Linklater's age as well as the people Linklater and company were, once upon a time."|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some!! may be a little shambling and uneventful. But like college, it's the late aimless nights and idle afternoons that you look back on most fondly when you get older.|Fresh
...not quite true to life, but it is true to a condensed point-of-view looking back.|Fresh
In its funky, aimless, winningly juvenile way, Everybody Wants Some is about as inclusively celebratory as any college comedy in memory: Per its title, it really does want everybody to get some.|Fresh
A breezy memory film with period details as dead-on as anyone expect from Linklater and without a mean bone in its body, it's a twangy, loping charmer.|Fresh
Structured with a deceptively casual hand, it's charming and smartly observed throughout, and the ensemble cast vanish into their period roles.|Fresh
The film luxuriates in a world that's the platonic ideal of youthful indulgence.|Fresh
Richard Linklater returns to his Dazed and Confused form with another lighthearted, supremely enjoyable tale of youth - Everybody Wants Some. This eighties party is a blast.|Fresh
Leave it to Linklater to create a nonstop party that keeps ringing undertones of what happens when the party's over. That's what makes it a Linklater film. He builds human comedies, the kind that last.|Fresh
A winningly retro slice-of-life look at a weekend in the life of some Texas ballplayers seeking girls, tunes and identity.|Fresh
A cast of talented young actors helps give Linklater's '80s throwback just the right balance of juvenile humor and heady intelligence|Fresh
"Finally, an ""Animal House"" movie for the generation that can remember seeing ""Animal House."" Maybe."|Fresh
"Ever-amiable, always ambling, achingly intelligent... with an ending that could readily melt into the first drawn clouds of Waking Life."""|Fresh
For all its ease, the film has a constant undercurrent of emotional truth.|Fresh
"""Everybody Wants Some!!,"" which partakes of Mr. Linklater's own recollections of Texas, baseball and college, unfolds in a mood of sweet, lascivious retrospect."|Fresh
If it's truly a spiritual sequel to anything it's 'Magic Mike XXL': a good times romp that ends with the realization that the good times one day end.|Fresh
With charm and a laid-back attitude, it seizes wit and wisdom in carefree moments of youth.|Fresh
Richard Linklater has crafted another of his poignant reveries -- not about how youth is squandered on the young but, rather, how youth is actually lived by the young.|Fresh
The experience of watching this film is one of reflective exuberance. It's a movie about people who arrive sure of themselves and depart in the quiet confidence that all they know is that they know nothing.|Fresh
It's a light, breezy, shaggy story where the most dramatic thing that happens is a scuffle in a disco.|Fresh
The film itself has an ease that's addictively cozy, whether its characters feel familiar or far removed. They're an endearing bunch of -- well, bros. In Linklater's dexterous hands, it doesn't feel like such a bad word.|Fresh
"[Linklater's] latest is, to borrow from Henry Miller, an ""incurably healthy"" film, about nothing so much as the pure pleasure of having a body and a mind to play with, and a smorgasbord of opportunities for putting both to work."|Fresh
[A] very well-acted, well-shot, elegantly edited comedy.|Fresh
[Linklater makes] films that are unconventional in form and function, but so effortlessly entertaining... Everybody Wants Some!! still pulls that trick off, but despite its laughs and moments of fun it can't help but feel like a step back.|Fresh
There are few writer/directors out there as good at perfectly capturing the lived-in feel of a very specific time and place. And in that way, Everybody Wants Some succeeds on every level.|Fresh
Like [Dazed and Confused], the movie is a celebration of the fun and freedom of youth, and it's simply in capturing this spirit that makes it succeed.|Fresh
In the best moments, [it] is about assimilation: a union of life-affirming music, the euphoric now, and people coming together who have nothing and everything in common.|Fresh
In making a movie about a baseball team hazing its new members, Linklater created a movie that feels like a hazing.|Fresh
Every bit as good as Dazed And Confused.|Fresh
"The strength of Linklater's films have always been their ability to capture the textures of lived experience, and ""Everyone Wants Some!!"" is no different in that regard."|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some is an opportunity to escape, live in this world for two hours and have some fun, but the experience also comes with a very important message that'll hit home for everyone. It celebrates the individual.|Fresh
A lot of it's funny - for instance, any scenes involving Powell's admittedly charming Finnegan or Hoechlin's testy McReynolds - but hanging out with these guys eventually becomes a chore.|Rotten
A marvel. The 'best film of 2016' race starts here.|Fresh
It's as honest and clear-eyed about the past as its predecessor, another in a filmography of unpredictable gems.|Fresh
Finn makes for a bit of bland protagonist, but he's nicely balanced out by his outlandish teammates, each so clearly defined by Linklater's subtly incisive screenplay.|Fresh
Linklater does connect you with the fun that he must have had in those days. If you can take the testosterone, you'll have a good time.|Fresh
Few filmmakers have so fully embraced the bittersweet joy of living in the moment - one that's all the more glorious because it fades so soon.|Fresh
Everybody Wants Some brilliantly, and hilariously, uses sexuality to mask the film's more dominant and profound theme - living with passion.|Fresh
