One of the first glistening droplets of the French New Wave.|Fresh
Seems forever young.|Fresh
Forget my curmudgeonly attitude and see it -- again, or for the first time -- for yourself.|Fresh
A remarkable confluence of talents are at work here.|Fresh
The cinematography by Henri DecaÃ« is gorgeous and 400 Blows is great to watch just on a technical level.|Fresh
[The 400 Blows'] most prevalent connection to the then burgeoning French New Wave is its message of freedom|Fresh
This beautiful, tough and some- times funny film is a lesson (by implication) in love : here's what it does, being without it.|Fresh
Truffaut imbues the movie with the irrepressible energy and optimism of youth.|Fresh
Childhood's frustrations for Truffaut are never far from its lilting delights|Fresh

A rich and fascinating look at youth and its fleeting joys...|Fresh
Truffaut's ode to his childhood is an engrossing watch that is alluring in its simplicity and brilliant in its direction. It flows nicely at its own pace, never allowing melodrama to ruin its realistic and voyeuristic atmosphere.|Fresh
Truffaut brought a fresh and piercingly honest portrayal of troubled youth to the screen. In many ways, Antonie Doinel is not only the cinematic embodiment of Truffaut, but also the French New Wave as a whole.|Fresh

Franois Truffaut's iconoclastic feature debut and one of the most enduring examples of the French New Wave.|Fresh
What is there to say about The 400 Blows that hasn't already been said?|Fresh
It's a cornerstone of the French New Wave, and one of the greatest movies about childhood, from anywhere, ever.|Fresh
Henri Decae's black and white photography helped Truffaut enormously but what the director himself provides is a sense that though there is no easy answer to the problems of growing up, there is a hope that will never be wholly denied.|Fresh
Vibrant, visually exciting and emotionally resonant.|Fresh
Distinguished by its naturalistic, quasi-documentary approach and an extraordinary central performance from the 12-year-old Jean-Pierre Laud, this is a blisteringly authentic story.|Fresh
It's streetwise stuff, shot in a vigorous on-the-hoof style, but also full of joy, both in its blissfully comic moments and in Doinel's telling passion for moviegoing.|Fresh
Alive with the joy of filmmaking for its own sake.|Fresh
If any movie in the Criterion Collection deserves to be released time and again, Antoine Doniel's first adventure is as good a candidate as any. Ideally, next time they might see fit to throw bonus feature addicts a bone.|Fresh
The 400 Blows, one of the initiating sparks of the French New Wave, ultimately boils down to the film's trendsetting coda, perhaps the most exclamatory question mark in movies.|Fresh

|Fresh
One of the best movies about childhood ever made because it's really a movie for adults. Without sentiment, it looks at the fears, doubts, and anxieties of childhood.|Fresh
A movingly sympathetic and perceptive portrayal about an unwanted rebellious adolescent.|Fresh

Laud's performance is a marvel in the way he conveys Antoine's frustration with the world around him and the inability of adults to understand him.|Fresh
Amazingly, this vigorous effort is the first feature film of M. Truffaut, who had previously been (of all things!) the movie critic for a French magazine.|Fresh

Its freshness still startles today.|Fresh
|Fresh
For all of Truffaut's mastery of the behind-the-camera aspects of The 400 Blows, an equal share of the credit must go to lead actor Jean-Pierre Laud.|Fresh
This bleak ending, with Antoine turning to stare into the camera, is among the most famous shots in cinema history, and for good reason.|Fresh
A landmark in modern cinema.|Fresh
The later films have their own merits, and Stolen Kisses is one of Truffaut's best, but The 400 Blows, with all its simplicity and feeling, is in a class by itself.|Fresh
Extraordinary.|Fresh
Perhaps Truffaut's most affecting film.|Fresh
... a bit like Holden Caulfield, except not nearly so eloquent|Fresh
[Truffaut's} eye for telling detail is unrivaled...|Fresh
