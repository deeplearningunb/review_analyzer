Argo is a fast-paced work, its last half hour keeps the viewer in constant tension. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
That's thanks to the direction, the performances, and the minimalist-yet-engaging emotional economy of the script. Argo is solid cinematic craftsmanship all around.|Fresh
Affleck...takes on what amounts to a historic period thriller with humorous elements and a hero in Mendez, and he does so like he's the second coming of Robert Redford and George Clooney.|Fresh
After all these years, Ben Affleck is still a listless actor. But he's a terrific director, and in Argo, he's done it again.|Fresh
It simmers with real tension as it leapfrogs among characters and locations as much as 7,500 miles apart. Mr. Affleck uses an old-fashioned ringing telephone as effectively as Alfred Hitchcock ever did.|Fresh
Argo is unquestionably a success, but it must be said that Affleck is not now, and will probably never be, a brilliant director.|Fresh
Argo serves not only as an expertly wrought piece of entertainment but also an act of patriotic tribute.|Fresh
...confirms [Ben] Affleck's status as a good director. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The critical situation of life or death is rarefied by a material that links with metacinematographic comedies - the preproduction of that fake film recalls Bowfinger or Ed Wood. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Fiction sometimes surpasses reality, and here, when reality seems fiction, there is no other way to relax and enjoy a finished film product. Hollywood has done it again. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A solid political spy movie, despite being gift-wrapped a little too neatly.|Fresh
This is one of the best American mainstream movies of the year and another taut, terrific film from director Affleck. Truly unmissable.|Fresh
Affleck is growing up as a filmmaker and Argo evinces newly found and assured footing for him.|Fresh
Affleck continues to impress audiences with his keen eye for direction, knowing just when to fall back and allow this top-notch cast the freedom to interpret the events in a way that will most compel viewers.|Fresh
Argo works 100 percent as a straight-up hard-boiled thriller, but its deeper thematic current is about trust.|Fresh
A solid take on an improbable event in American history.|Fresh
This is better than any horror movie.|Fresh
The film doesn't favour one side over the other. Also, the dramatisation is not without its light moments.|Fresh
A riveting and exceedingly assured feature, Argo is a first-rate thriller that whilst lacking in any sense of historical relevance remains a perfectly fashioned piece of evening escapism.|Fresh
With the guidance of Affleck's steady hand and a clear vision, Argo builds a compelling story of both courage and deceit.|Fresh
As solid and engrossing as Argo is, however, don't believe all the hype -- it falls short of exceptional.|Fresh
The screenplay abounds in droll dialogue and provides insider insight into Hollywood even lampooning people who work in show business.|Fresh
Truth is stranger than fiction, it's a fact; but when truth and fiction morph into each other, the strangeness factor increases exponentially. That's what happens in Ben Affleck's ingenious take on the real-life CIA (Iran hostage) mission.|Fresh
It's so sleek and well-made that you'll wish you could park it in your driveway and show it off to your neighbors.|Fresh
If the aim is to draw a parallel between the artifice of Hollywood and the spy trade, Argo never quite comes together, but it is a well-executed thriller that tells a true story in entertaining fashion.|Fresh
A solid piece of entertainment as well as a timely and exciting encapsulation of real-life historical intrigue, Argo shows actor-director Ben Affleck in impressive form almost all the way across the board.|Fresh
Affleck is still building up his chops as a director, but the intelligence and ambition he brings to filmmaking are particularly apparent in Argo.|Fresh
"The old saw ""truth is stranger than fiction"" has had its teeth properly sharpened in the superb thriller Argo, a blend of political history and Hollywood hijinks that goes right for the jugular."|Fresh
How do you mix a sweaty thriller with Wag the Dog-like chicanery and one-liners? He pulls it off, in part because the backdrops and costumes are so authentic and the performances so straightforward. It is also his technique.|Fresh
I can't remember the last time I was in a movie theater audience that clapped. Twice. Even I clapped. It's that good.|Fresh
Credit Affleck for keeping these two wildly different ideas and tones in check. The Tehran portions would have been too grim without the humor, and the Hollywood scenes too flippant without the deadly stakes.|Fresh
Much like his earlier directorial efforts, Gone Baby Gone and The Town, Affleck delivers a blockbuster with brains that's populated by nicely rounded characters.|Fresh
Sharp, brisk and highly entertaining.|Fresh
The emotional catharsis of Argo isn't what happens onscreen, but the sheer knowledge that the creaky old moviemaking system has put together something this crowd-pleasing and great.|Fresh
It's not quite high art, but Affleck makes a potboiler here, joining the upper ranks of actors-turned-directors. Nice job, Ben.|Fresh
With star -- and the film's director -- Ben Affleck sporting his best bushy beard and playing a genial spook, Argo turns out to be an enjoyable and polished spy thriller.|Fresh
Argo doesn't quite match Gone Baby Gone or The Town for quality but that just shows how much of an impression the one time star of Bounce has made in the director's chair.|Fresh
A smart, gripping thriller and further proof that Ben Affleck is as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it.|Fresh
Argo is one of this year's must-see films which, unlike most, is tremendous entertainment.|Fresh
The staging of the actual airport getaway is flawless and thrilling; in recreating it Affleck is blunt in depicting the hatred fueling the hunt for remaining Americans on Iranian soil.|Fresh
Affleck's eye as a director is relentlessly curious, constantly looking for the details that sell the emotion or the tension or the subtext, and it feels like he's become very confident.|Fresh
[An] exceedingly good period thriller.|Fresh
Argo is crackerjack entertainment deserving of both awards and box office as it offers up two hours of laughs, suspense and history in an extremely enjoyable package.|Fresh
Argo certainly isn't a film to be dismissed, the interesting moments should be enough to pull you through, but a film like this, about this story, with this cast, really had the potential to be much more.|Fresh
Ben Affleck has delivered a knuckle-muncher of a thriller and a satire on Hollywood, both in one unlikely package.|Fresh
The acting of the ensemble cast -- led strongly by Affleck, who also directed the picture -- is faultless. No one steals a scene. Everyone picks one up, runs with it a while, and hands it to someone else.|Fresh
Argo is consistently tense, entertaining and watchable. After Gone Baby Gone, The Town and now this, Affleck is a bigger star behind the camera than in front of it.|Fresh
Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. And sometimes it isn't, and it must be bent and twisted out of shape until any authenticity becomes purely theoretical.|Rotten
Even though the ending is well known, Affleck masterfully maintains the tension, tempering it with welcome laughs provided by two veteran filmmakers involved in the scheme (Alan Arkin and John Goodman).|Fresh
Argo is extremely savvy entertainment, deftly blending showbiz satire with street-level suspense sequences.|Fresh
Affleck's resurgence continues with a solid third directorial outing, and great performances from the entire cast.|Fresh
Only two scenes do more than hint at the poetic potential of the premise.|Rotten
Extraordinarily suspenseful, extremely well-told and effortless in its complex tonal balance, Argo is a captivating and thoughtful true-life drama that boasts a story so astonishing, it could only be told in the movies.|Fresh
With one of the better ensembles in recent memory, Affleck purposely gives his cast room to shine while not diminishing the risks Mendez took.|Fresh
Affleck, who directs as well as stars, conjures a denouement every bit as stomach-shredding as Skyfall's.|Fresh
Fists will be clenched, jaws will be locked, breath will be held and hearts will palpitate, all while you sit on the edge of your seat. If Affleck has committed any cinematic sins in the past, Argo absolves him of them all.|Fresh
Affleck is becoming a more skillful director with each passing project, and in terms of both technical accomplishment and entertainment value, Argo is a worthy successor to his previous films, Gone Baby Gone and The Town.|Fresh
While the plot of Argo sounds too unbelievable to be true, this fact-based story ends up as both compelling and as exciting as any adventure James Bond ever had.|Fresh
By not pandering sentimentality, Affleck has managed a task that, like its subject, seems impossible: He's taken what others would have turned into farce and emerged with one of the year's best pictures.|Fresh
Ben Affleck's wildly entertaining thriller Argo is further proof of the old Hollywood adage that fiction is stranger than truth after all.|Fresh
The film hits most of its comic notes on the backs of two Hollywood old-timers played by Alan Arkin and John Goodman, who clearly relish the opportunity to lampoon people they work with every day.|Fresh
This is mature, invigorating stuff, alternately tense, funny, stirring and ultimately very satisfying.|Fresh
This is premium, breathless entertainment.|Fresh
A superior effort in which Affleck seldom fails to maintain suspense.|Fresh
The film, for all its ample smarts and solid academic craft, is just a great time at the movies.|Fresh
... a terrific piece of filmmaking.|Fresh
"Ben Affleck is one of this generation's best directors and ""Argo"" is a tight, engaging thriller."|Fresh
Argo is director Ben Affleck's weakest effort by far, but still a well-made, performance-driven historical drama.|Fresh
The only reason to watch Argo is because it's heavily padded, and while it works pretty well regardless, I wouldn't hold that up as an example of high quality filmmaking.|Fresh
The top-notch packaging reveals Argo for what it really is: less a nail-biting chamber-piece character drama and more a coolly realized, wildly reckless, actioner.|Fresh
Ben Affleck continues to thrust himself into the top echelon of directors.|Fresh
Affleck Extraordinaire!|Fresh
Ben Affleck is a director who appreciates the art of storytelling and masters the rare virtue of restraint...|Fresh
The sky's the limit for Ben Affleck right now, and its nothing less than he deserves.|Fresh
The picture finds a way to blend, of all things, quite funny Hollywood comedy -- yes, you read that right -- with not-so-funny derring-do in Tehran.|Fresh
Affleck spins the absurd true story into an engrossing espionage thriller that would be utterly ridiculous if the stakes weren't literally life-or-death.|Fresh
After Gone Baby Gone, The Town and now this directorial-best, Affleck is establishing himself as a major craftsman.|Fresh
Affleck inserts such thoughtful commentary and ideas unobtrusively into his film; there's no ideological ball-peen hammer from the filmmaker to drive his beliefs into the audience.|Fresh
Argo expertly builds tension and makes you wonder whether the mission will succeed.|Fresh
There are many heroes in Ben Affleck's spunky, polished political thriller. But the biggest hero is Hollywood itself.|Fresh
A strong yet uneven effort...|Fresh
We are invested in this rescue mission not simply because these are fellow Americans in peril, but also because Argo takes the time to make each person behind enemy lines unique and authentic.|Fresh
An edge-of-your-seat thriller not to be forgotten at Oscar time!|Fresh
'Argo' only clocks in at a two-hour running time and tells a much better story than the films that over-stuff audiences with nearly three-hours.|Fresh
Second billing to unabashed jingoism|Rotten
This may be the most geek-friendly movie that never did the rounds at Comic-Con.|Fresh
When Tony (Ben Affleck) lands in Tehran and trains the frightened Americans to play their parts as a Canadian film crew, Argo compares the ruses run by governments and movie studios.|Fresh
The whole thing is paced like a whip, and the third act may literally be the most suspenseful piece of film I've ever seen - and yes, I have seen Rear Window. Recommended without any reservation for every and any cinemagoer.|Fresh
A terrific supporting cast, especially the non A-list actors, make the dramatic license taken justified and redeem Affleck for miscasting himself in the hero's role.|Fresh
A brilliant thriller that's based on a historical incident, 'Argo' is one of the best films of 2012.|Fresh
A wonderfully lively and engrossing movie ...|Fresh
An enthralling and deliciously entertaining movie -- and a deserved triumph for its star and director.|Fresh
Functional.|Fresh
The details make for a rip-roaring story, which Affleck invests with old-school directorial élan.|Fresh
Ben Affleck leaps on to the A-list of directors with this relentlessly entertaining thriller, combining comedy and nerve-jangling suspense to maximum effect.|Fresh
If you're a nailbiter, bring gloves, because the suspense will see you reach your knuckles.|Fresh
Surprisingly enjoyable, given that you may have little prior commitment to this story and only mildly fancy Affleck.|Fresh
Affleck skilfully turns the screw of suspense, gaining added traction from an extremely convincing recreation of the setting and period.|Fresh
Ben Affleck's movie tells an amazing but true story set against the context of the Iranian hostage crisis.|Fresh
Talent borrows and genius steals, but Affleck does something in between: he mimics.|Fresh
It's impossible to be bored by a story this good, especially with that cast.|Fresh
Part of what makes this headspinning story believable is the fact that it pans out in an oddly uncomplicated way.|Fresh
The shaggy and bearded Ben Affleck, barely recognisable from his former self, gives a great lead performance. Understated, intense and steely-eyed, Affleck has the screen presence of legendary actor/director Clint Eastwood.|Fresh
Affleck the director is utterly sure-footed with an instinctive feel for characterization, tension and pacing as he builds the action towards a nail-biting climax.|Fresh
A dum-tight thriller demonstrating that Affleck is one of the most accomplished directors working in Hollywood today.|Fresh
[Affleck] once again proves, as he did in The Town, that he's a pretty good actor but a great director.|Fresh
Nailing the tension, the terror and the gallows humour of its story without resorting to jingoism or losing sight of its political context, Argo is a close-to-flawless thriller with a devilishly smart mouth.|Fresh
Better to watch it as a meta cinema commentary than a historical thriller. Either way, Argo is both smart and fun but ultimately lightweight. Star Wars fans may well cry before the credits roll.|Fresh
It's to Affleck's credit that he manages to knit Hollywood levity into the genuinely gripping question of whether the embassy Americans can pull this off.|Fresh
Ben Affleck proves that his transition from blockbuster poster boy to serious dramatic director is now complete...The film's portrayal of America as a superpower under siege serves as a timely comment on the nation's place in the world today.|Fresh
While I'm not buying into the early Oscar hype for 'Argo,' it is a gripping and exciting story that is mostly true and mostly authentic.|Fresh
Hold on tight and revel in the brilliance of a riveting film that's enthralling in execution and subtext.|Fresh
Affleck has crafted a truly old school suspense movie that is as involving as any film I've seen this year.|Fresh
Given today's headline news from the Middle East, it seems not only frighteningly, jarringly real, but like it could easily have happened last week.|Fresh
There is an intelligent, funny film waiting to come out of this story; it will have to keep waiting.|Rotten
A not to miss film|Fresh
With a tension right out of the best of Hitchcock, Affleck directs Chris Terrio's masterful screenplay with a restraint that never overplays the comic elements or overstates the obvious -- and with a velocity that seldom allows you to catch a breath.|Fresh
Affleck has paraded well beyond dramatic liberties into a thick confetti of parochial myth-making, and it's disconcerting to see how content he appears to be with trading fact for fiction.|Rotten
Mel Brooks meets John Frankenheimer ... a strange blend of inside Hollywood comedy and docudrama. The parts don't always mesh, but they do often enough to assure Affleck another crowd-pleaser|Fresh
This pulse-racing thriller, set in the aftermath of Iran's Islamic Revolution, grabs you by the throat.|Fresh
Argo is among the worthiest spy thrillers to come out of Hollywood in years, and it puts to rest (at least for this reviewer) any doubts over Affleck's chops as a smart, shrewd director of consistently topnotch fare.|Fresh
"Argo will make you say ""wow"" not because of anything big and flashy but purely for its well-told story."|Fresh
It's a reminder of what the movies can offer when they're at their best: an escape into another world and a pertinent look at our own.|Fresh
As a director, Ben Affleck is getting into Alan Pakula territory.|Fresh
Even when it embellishes certain details leading up to its climax, Affleck and his actors by that time have sold the audience on its authenticity. How appropriate.|Fresh
I found it hard for me to get into at first, but the final act more than makes up for it. Ben Affleck sure has come a long way since his days with Kevin Smith.|Fresh
It's exciting, it's funny, it's suspenseful. The ending is nail-biting.|Fresh
This is a classy heist movie with a bizarre set-up; it's entertaining as well as thrilling.|Fresh
A tense political thriller with a dash of Hollywood satire thrown in to sweeten the deal, this is a gripping crowd pleaser that is sure to take home some statuettes come Oscar season. Your move, Matt Damon.|Fresh
The real Argo that's landing in cinemas now shouldn't be mistaken as anything other than a spellbinding, old-fashioned thriller. I've got sweaty palms and an elevated pulse to prove that it's one of the year's very best films.|Fresh
A suspenseful, topical and surprisingly humorous film that's deserving of the Oscar buzz surrounding it.|Fresh
The only real criticism, surprisingly, is Affleck. Perhaps the time has come to think about spending more time behind the camera rather than in front of it.|Fresh
...incredibly entertaining, lucid crowd pleaser. I'm [annoyed] that people may hear the synopsis and go 'Oh, that's not my thing', because Argo is everyone's thing: it's one of the year's best films.|Fresh
Its politics are subtle, its performances are good, and its script is amazing.|Fresh
"There's ""creating an intense, claustrophobic situation in a foreign locale"" and there's ""inciting unquestioning fear of 'the other',"" and Argo pulls off the former far more often than it accidentally achieves the latter."|Fresh
An ingeniously conceived thriller that's almost as much about our collective love of cinema as it is a tricky international incident.|Fresh

One of the year's best|Fresh
It's okay to take a few liberties in the name of a good story|Fresh
A funny trip to Hollywood and gripping escape from Tehran.|Fresh
Hats off to Argo, a taut, clever new film directed by and starring Ben Affleck, for deftly, constructing historical realism five minutes into the narrative and locking us into that frantic period of 1979.|Fresh
If there's one lesson to be gleaned from director Ben Affleck's relentlessly tense, painstakingly detailed Argo, it's that we should consider the possibility that our history has been manipulated more than many of us would care to admit.|Fresh
Argo smacks of being another dreary Oscar contender but in actuality it's destined to be one of the fall's most purely enjoyable films.|Fresh
Ar-go see them in action.|Fresh
... a crackling good suspense thriller ...|Fresh
I was literally in tears for parts of Argo, a purely physical reaction, not an emotional one, to deal with the tension... That isn't only some serious movie magic, it's a downright master class in suspense filmmaking from director Ben Affleck.|Fresh
Under its own terms as an upscale mainstream thriller, it's a total success. This is classy moviemaking, from its well-observed performances to immaculate eye for period detail.|Fresh
a crackerjack based-on-a-true story thriller that finally allows actor/director Ben Affleck to demonstrate his behind-the-camera muscles in a location other than his native Boston|Fresh
[A] perfectly lovely, immensely watchable, intermittently shallow, and slightly bloated thriller.|Fresh
Successfully manages to be respectful about the turbulent events and function as an exciting Hollywood spy thriller.|Fresh
As the suspense intensifies, it becomes increasingly obvious that many of these suspense-laden plot points are simply made up. The story turns into a standard Hollywood formula and it loses credibility because of that.|Fresh
Argo feels like a proper old-fashioned 70s thriller, the kind Alan J Pakula used to make: taut and lean, but with dialogue to die for, plus character and attitude to spare.|Fresh
Impeccably directed, superbly written and brilliantly acted, this is a terrifically entertaining thriller that gets everything right and confirms Ben Affleck as a major directing talent.|Fresh
For a story about out-of-the-box thinking and high-risk heroism, Argo plays it surprisingly safe.|Fresh
This is a film that runs the gamut from grim to absurd.|Fresh
Combining laughs and thrills with plenty of verve, Ben Affleck continues his smart directorial career with a stylish, gripping hostage drama.|Fresh
Argo is tense, affective and not just Affleck's best film but one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Ben Affleck continues his hot streak as a director.|Fresh
Affirms Affleck's talents and, perhaps, his limitations. The period detail and overall technical credits impress, but Affleck relies too often on handheld camera to convey intensity, and on crosscutting to generate suspense or 'irony.'|Fresh
...the best kind of Hollywood movie, a gripping, suspenseful story leavened with dry grim humor and resolved in well-earned uplift.|Fresh
Argo is a terrific movie that pulls off the rare trifecta of being smart, funny and exciting.|Fresh
Now that Affleck taken up directing and chosen his acting roles more carefully, the wait between his films seems intolerably long.|Fresh
"""Argo"" helps cement his (Afflecks) new reputation as a fine film maker, one who should hear his name called when Oscar nominations are announced."|Fresh
Affleck's triumph is the way he blends multiple tones in making 'Argo' work as an Iran story, a Hollywood story and a Washington, D.C., story.|Fresh
'Argo' is one of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
What Affleck has proven again with this directing and acting project is that a film by him is a movie event that shouldn't be missed.|Fresh

Appealing conventional thriller.|Fresh
Affleck knows how to keep a tight grip on a story, gets better at ratcheting tension with every film, and displays a fearlessness when it comes to mixing genre.|Fresh
"A traditional mainstream Hollywood thriller that mixes humor and serious life-and-death situations. It also has the extra bonus of ""historical importance"" because it's based on a true story."|Fresh
An amazingly proficient film ... If the movie gains any traction, expect one of its snatches of dialogue to permeate our collective consciousness.|Fresh
"Argo is a skillful, dramatic entertainment. It's slick. But in its rush to be ""feel-good,"" Argo sacrifices a lot - such as depth and credibility. It has thrills and laughs; it just doesn't have much substance."|Fresh
The plaudits have to go to Ben Affleck, whose producing/directing/acting trifecta makes 'Argo' one of the top films of the year, and a natural for the Oscar.|Fresh
The closer the film gets to its big finale, the more we can hear the hum of typical suspense-thriller machinery.|Fresh
Argo is a gripping, nail-biting thriller whose last act will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.|Fresh
A testament to Affleck's uncanny storytelling ability, making mission impossible possible.|Fresh

Argo is a feat for Ben Affleck as a director, and this third time as a charm proves he's one of the most promising directors working today.|Fresh
Ben Affleck, director, can do no wrong with the terrific political thriller Argo. Ben Affleck, actor and star, that's another story.|Fresh
A nail-biter of the highest order, Argo is crackerjack mix of world politics, classic screen suspense, and knowing Hollywood ribbing.|Fresh
Taut, intelligent, funny, timely and thoroughly entertaining. Finally, there comes along a Hollywood movie made for adults.|Fresh
Argo is a godsend. It's a fully realized commercial film that tells an engaging, based on true life tale in a terrific, spellbinding fashion.|Fresh
Easily Affleck's best directed film yet, Argo also ticks off a number of boxes on the Best Picture nominee checklist: grand scope, historical basis, uplifting story of human triumph. The movie's great escape sequence goes a little overboard,though.|Fresh
Suspenseful, astounding true story of an improbable rescue mission during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Ben Affleck has directed one of the year's best films.|Fresh
Clever, competent filmmaking with lovable characters and catchy dialog, the kind of movie Aaron Sorkin might make if he was just a smidge less of a smarmy prick. And obviously, Affleck's beard is the bomb.|Fresh
...a taut tale that can keep you on the edge of your seat...Affleck again shows that he is one of the best directors in Hollywood.|Fresh
An edge of your seat drama that will give you some much needed entertainment!|Fresh
Divorce it from awards-season hype, and Argo holds up fine: There's no need to pretend it's something it's not, when what it is works just fine.|Fresh
A goofy sci-fi film dubbed Argo never got made in 1980. Fortunately for moviegoers, a brilliant, Oscar-worthy drama/thriller of the same name did get made in 2012.|Fresh
For those people with lingering questions about Ben Affleck's talents as a filmmaker, Argo should remove any doubt.|Fresh
Argo has that solid, kick-the-tires feel of those studio films from the 70s that were about something but also entertained. Only it's as laugh outright amusing as it is sobering.|Fresh
Taut political thriller based on real-life escape from Iran.|Fresh
... Seamlessly blends elements of the thriller, political drama, heist movie and comedy, with none of those disparate elements undermining any of the others.|Fresh
Affleck has made a film that features multiple locations, dozens of speaking roles, and the kind of tonal shifting that veterans routinely screw up and he's not only dodged the many potential pitfalls but made a modern classic by doing so.|Fresh
Argo may be a good film that was just viewed by someone who isn't its target audience, but in the meantime feels like another Ben Affleck related project that's being over praised because of who's attached to it and its bureaucratic subject matter.|Rotten
Affleck successfully uses history to tap into very real fears (both personal and political) about what may come tomorrow.|Fresh
Affleck impresses with the thematic sophistication of his vision. He is a man who truly believes in the redemptive powers of cinema.|Fresh
The movieland satire is laid on thick, but it's also deadly accurate. Schlock has never seemed so patriotic, and Arkin and Goodman have rarely been so good.|Fresh
Five years ago, I thought Ben Affleck was done.|Fresh
"A gutsy blend of suspense and off-the-wall humor, ""Argo"" will immediately grab you from the rush of its prologue and not let go until the end credits roll."|Fresh
It is startling how recent events have lent Argo an almost uncanny currency-in the process highlighting sobering current realities downplayed by the media.|Fresh
Terrio's script and Affleck's direction combine these disparate settings - the glamour of a phony Hollywood party and the chaos of battle-torn Tehran - with an attention for detail that makes both worlds authentic and alive.|Fresh
"Whatever the blow to Canuck pride, the real story of ""Argo"" makes for one fantastic movie, a gripping fact-based thriller whose tension is spiced with humor and poignancy."|Fresh
Ben Affleck's excellent thriller Argo does what all films based upon 'true stories' should: Find a historical tale very few are familiar with, and tell it with the gusto of great fiction.|Fresh
Every step of the way is thrilling and heart-pounding.|Fresh
"There is not a wasted moment of action or dialogue in this film. ""Argo"" should rightfully be on Oscar's short list of Best Movies for 2012."|Fresh
Argo is a rollicking yarn, easily the most cohesive and technically accomplished of Affleck's three films so far, but a part of me wishes the director hadn't cast himself in the lead role.|Fresh
John Goodman and Alan Arkin make the Hollywood side of the movie fabulous, but Argo spends too much time in waiting-around mode to be fully successful as a thriller.|Fresh
It might still be early in the Best Picture award race season, but this is clearly one of the top front-runners.(Full Content Review for Parents also available)|Fresh
Is Argo the best movie it could possibly be? No, but what it is is still pretty damn great.|Fresh
Politically relevant but free of the usual cynicism and controversy that typically makes such movies a downer for general audiences, Ben Affleck's dramatic thriller is a perfectly worthwhile piece of Oscar-friendly entertainment.|Fresh
I suspect that ARGO will end up being one of 2012′s most celebrated films. And that is just how it should be. This is an American movie that can bring us together during these polarized times.|Fresh
If nothing else, it proves that every so often, the CIA can pull something off - and that yes, Canadians are just about the nicest people on the planet.|Fresh
The film is a whopper of a tale, one designed for Oscar nominations, Best Picture and Best Director among them.|Fresh
"Take away the regrettable late-1970s fashion and facial hair and director Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" is one timely, taut thriller."|Fresh
Argo is funny, scary and completely enthralling. And it's smart.|Fresh
Argo is a movie of many parts, the sum of which can probably be best described as enjoyable Hollywood hokum.|Fresh
It's a well-told story that's timely, topical and thoroughly entertaining.|Fresh
It may not have a lot beyond its outrageous story, but the story is undeniably a doozy, and the movie is a blast.|Fresh
If you didn't know otherwise, you'd swear this was the work of a veteran master like Steven Soderbergh.|Fresh
It's serious and substantive, an ingeniously written and executed drama fashioned from a fascinating, little-known chapter of recent history.|Fresh
Affleck has emerged as one of the premier directors in Hollywood, even if it is very very very very good instead of magnificent.|Fresh
This is movie storytelling at its best, and if it didn't play out quite this way in real life, it should have.|Fresh

That terrifying opening sequence prompts the realization that we've never really had the definitive film treatment of this chapter in American history. The rest of the movie prompts the realization that maybe this is it.|Fresh
The movie is accomplished enough to stand alongside the 1970s political thrillers that inspired it, right down to the vintage red-and-black Warner Bros. logo that opens the film.|Fresh
Fusing suspense and humor in a political thriller is a tricky prospect, but Argo is more than up to the task.|Fresh
It's the definition of far-fetched popcorn-patriotic heroics.|Rotten

"With America's tormented relationship with Iran back on the global front burner, ""Argo"" is also a crafty, reflective mood piece that will leave you thinking about the resounding echoes of that tormented and not-so-distant era."|Fresh

An entertaining, real-life, race-the-clock thriller that nabs you at the start and never makes a wrong move.|Fresh
It's an embodiment of the kind of quality adult film that really shouldn't be an endangered species, and a love letter from Affleck to the industry that made him, shunned him, and loves nothing more than to be loved.|Fresh
The film offers bitter food for thought at a time when the Middle East is going through yet another frantically incendiary period.|Fresh
Fact-based but politically cautious.|Rotten
