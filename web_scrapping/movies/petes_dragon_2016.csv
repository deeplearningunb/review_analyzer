What Pete's Dragon lacks in originality it makes up for in visual and special effects....second-tier Disney, but I suspect it will be viewed as an underrated film as time goes by.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is family entertainment at its best.|Fresh
While the theme or the emotional story may not offer anything new, Lowery's therapeutic execution deserves a watch for sure.|Fresh
This is the perfect way to update an already existing film - by never drawing from the nostalgia of the original, creating it's own unique song.|Fresh
Remarkably, from the very first shot of young Pete and his parents driving into the country side, Pete's Dragon has a very Steven Spielberg like quality.|Fresh
This remake definitely gets there in the end, helped by a strong adult cast, a well-constructed story and some superb visual effects.|Fresh
In its emotional maturity and visual beauty, this is as dignified and fine as any children's movie I've seen in an inordinately long time.|Fresh
The amazingly-created Elliott is a plus, but the real draw is the timeless, heartwarming story that's brilliantly brought to life by the cast.|Fresh
Thank god, this thing feels like a kids' movie that has actual stakes. Remember those?|Fresh

In a summer of blockbusters that have been both deafening and disappointing, Pete's Dragon is a serene surprise success for Disney.|Fresh
Thanks to its charming story and engaging characters, Pete's Dragon is a delightful, fast-paced, and sweet film that the entire family can enjoy together.|Fresh
Big on sentiment, belief and awe - though it's purposefully small and straightforward in its story.|Fresh
Based loosely on the original film, the plot harks back to a kind of simpler time, with far fewer entanglements and extraneous story details.|Fresh
"Eventful, issue-driven, well-mounted if somewhat gloomy reinvention of the ""lost"" 1977 Disney family film...A good ride that feeds the public's seemingly insatiable hunger for dragons."|Fresh
Redford, on the other hand, seems confused. Specifically, he looks like a guy who just woke up and was told he'd be playing the Mickey Rooney role in a Pete's Dragon remake.|Rotten

Don't think twice before going in to see this magical adventure. You won't be disappointed.|Fresh
A magical tale of love and letting go.|Fresh
A rare delight in how it respects the intelligence of its audience while still offering up lump-in-the-throat emotional beats in service of a welcomely straightforward story.|Fresh
Like a great modern song, it somehow feels new and classic at the same time.|Fresh
Viewed independently of its problematic pedigree, however, this gently meandering affair only just gets by.|Rotten
Hugely enjoyable.|Fresh
The result is unusually small and surprisingly genuine for a modern Disney production. The film values friendship, but also acknowledges trauma.|Fresh
'Be open to looking' is both metaphysical counsel and practical advice in director David Lowery's powerful film about a literally warm and fuzzy fire-breather.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is, in the end, an awfully well-intentioned misfire that feels as though it should be so much better.|Rotten
it is safe for parents to take their little ones to watch Pete's Dragon. The bigger lessons in this sweet and gentle film are about the family you make, the ties that bind and the fact that you can be a good friend, regardless of your size.|Fresh

A remake of the part animated 1977 film of the same name, this completely live action version re-imagines the story and emerges as a film capable of captivating both children and adults alike.|Fresh
When it is all said and done, summer 2016 won't be remembered for the unending DC vs Marvel feud. It will be remembered for films like Pete's Dragon.|Fresh
Your kids will cry through the majority of the film, and you probably will too.|Fresh
This film packs an emotional punch. It is well acted and directed. There is action and there is spectacle, but it doesn't overwhelm the story, which is essentially about human relationships, friendships and love.|Fresh
One more thing about Pete's Dragon: You will cry. A lot.|Fresh
Our best fables and fairy tales are the ones that speak truth, and this version of Pete's Dragon easily takes its place on any short list of the great films for young audiences as a result.|Fresh
Lowery's not just an artisan crafting what could've been product - he's creating a road map for how these remakes should be done, if, indeed, that's where we're going anyway.|Fresh
One of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of the year so far.|Fresh
Disney's Pete's Dragon remake is one of the summer's better movies -- and that would have been the case even in a summer that wasn't largely dominated by lousy sequels and tired franchise extensions.|Fresh
Free of the flamboyance that marks so many kids' movies, and of the winking references to the past that plague so many remakes, Lowery's vision is wonderful and big-hearted, beautiful inside and out.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon won't be winning any awards for originality, but who cares when it does the simple things so effectively?|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is so preserved in its own universe and separate from the commercialism of modern kid's movies that it's actually quite refreshing.|Fresh
The gentle nature and leisurely pace might cause a few Coked out kids to fidget, but most should react positively to the picture's sense of adventure and discovery.|Fresh
By turns funny, sad, scary and exciting, this is terrific family entertainment, though children who are easily upset may be disturbed by some of the intense action scenes.|Fresh
It's possibly a little too gentle and a few jokes might have made it even better but, these days, Hollywood films as quietly humane as this one are almost as rare as dragons.|Fresh
It may be extremely slight and even too wholesome for modern tastes but Pete's Dragon is still welcome family fare.|Fresh
Although the pathos is ladled on a little over-generously, the handsome photography, the first-rate performances ... and an endearing overgrown puppy of a dragon make this a strong alternative to animation for family audiences.|Fresh
.... their scenes together are fun to watch. Really, could there ever be a better best friend than a fire-breathing dragon who likes to cuddle?|Fresh
While I think that the angry dragon's fire would singe his inappropriate fur, this new version is a pleasing, lovely-looking family film.|Fresh
Enchantingly earnest, perhaps the best live-action, family film of the summer....|Fresh
The original 'Pete's Dragon' wasn't much more than a goofy flight of fancy. The remake, while well-made and well-acted, feels lifeless and uninspired.|Rotten
Our desire to believe in the magical burns bright in childhood, but it's a fire that experience in a frequently cruel world eventually snuffs out. Pete's Dragon has enough charm to rekindle that flame.|Fresh
Amid the obligatory effects-driven spectacle and playful kid-friendly mischief are some quiet and surprisingly touching moments of bonding between two outcasts.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon succeeds as a dramatic reimagining of its predecessor - giving rise to a soulful modern fairy tale in the process.|Fresh
It's beautifully balanced between developing a slow-rising narrative that also takes its time to build characters, without ever veering into precious or sentimental territory.|Fresh
This tale is very well told, nicely paced and perfectly pitched in a movie that doesn't make the mistake of outstaying its welcome. And like all the best children's films, it reminds world-weary parents what being a kid actually feels like.|Fresh
Impressively directed and with amazing performances, Pete's Dragon captures the magic and fantasy from childhood, that's missing nowdays. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In the tradition of Disney's best live-action features, this charming re-imagining is a grand family adventure.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is a satisfying and touching family adventure drama.|Fresh
The strength of Lowery's Pete's Dragon lies in its restraint; the confidence that no single idea or plot point from the source material would be too precious or revered to do away with.|Fresh
Sweet. Boring.|Rotten
It's an uplifting tearjerker, and deserving of your box-office dollars.|Fresh
A Fantasy/Adventure film in the vein of Spielberg's early films. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Bryce Dallas Howard, last seen ridiculously mishandling children around huge fantastical animals in ""Jurassic World,"" sheds her heels for sneakers and enjoys a complete reversal in believability, her familial warmth shining through."|Fresh
A Disney vehicle that swoops in to fill us with a sense of wonder. .. Filmmaker Lowery has helmed a joyful re-imagining destined to be the delight of the summer...|Fresh
"""The (new) Jungle Book"" it's certainly not, but anyone with a heart should enjoy ""Pete's"" easy-going resolution."|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is genial and family friendly. But there's entirely too much setup, precious little action, not much magic, and even at 103 minutes it feels at least 20 too long.|Rotten
Wonderful remake of Disney classic has peril, sad moments.|Fresh
Nothing like the original. No music thankfully. Manipulative and if you're emotional or taking kids, it's a two hanky movie. Kids might like it. Adults will be bored.|Rotten
Great kids' films will always have something there for the adults but there is no appeal here. Children may get lost in a sense of wonder at the incredibly cute Elliott, but there are better films out there that would be worth picking up instead.|Rotten
An offbeat underwhelmer with moments of quiet charm.|Rotten
Pete's Dragon is delightfully low key and delicate... It's a film about characters, story, and emotions that also happens to have a CGI dragon in it -- one that is effectively brought to life through the animation.|Fresh
A contemplative and beautiful movie with just enough action to keep things interesting.|Fresh
Strong, heartfelt performances barely compensate for the dull screenplay. It ultimately lacks the magic of the classic children's book.|Fresh
A rare family film that takes its time and allows the characters to breathe, to romp in the forest, to gaze at stars...I wish I'd grown up watching this film instead of the original.|Fresh
"""Pete's Dragon"" is nearly perfect family entertainment. Grab your children --- or go alone!"|Fresh
...[a] hopeless mishmash of, among other things, The Jungle Book, Tarzan, E.T., and King Kong...|Rotten
Turning, 'Ugh, another remake' into, 'hey, I wouldn't mind a Pete's Dragon 2|Fresh
Painted in vivid colors, flush with love and alive with whimsy, Pete's Dragon is a superbly sweet and earnestly enchanting delight.|Fresh
The next 'Stranger Things' ... channels Spielberg's adventure spirit and then soars higher with authenticsweetness and scares.|Fresh
The kind of film that can entertain more attentive and patient children simply by putting a memorable world and memorable characters onscreen.|Fresh
A lovely, old-fashioned remake with a wonderful family friendly vibe.|Fresh
It's a magical small tale with a big critter and a big heart. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Stuff for young kids, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
It is all refashioned in just the right way with just the right level of sincerity to make the project seem like less of a cash grab and more an honest effort to entertain and enthrall.|Fresh
Rather than a big, special effects-driven blockbuster, this remake of the 1977 Disney musical has the homespun feel of a children's book come-to-life.|Fresh
While the sentimentality is as tangible as the surroundings, nothing is overcooked or forced home.|Fresh
Funny, heartwarming and glorious to look at, it's as if the technology has finally caught up with the story.|Fresh
More wistful and introspective than most family movies this year, Pete's Dragon is deeply moving and unforgettably touching. This is timeless storytelling.|Fresh
It's a deeply affecting experience, and while the film remains just a boy-and-his-dragon story in the end, its depths hold wisdom and comfort.|Fresh
I took my twin ten-year-old nieces and they sat on the edge of their seats throughout, utterly rapt, then pronounced the film 'really, really, really good'.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon may owe more to E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, along with a dash of The Jungle Book,than it does to the original Pete's Dragon.|Fresh
The goofy, cartoonish elements are gone, as are the musical numbers. But no one can quite settle on what should replace them.|Rotten
"It is slightly unfair to say that this reboot of ""Pete's Dragon"" is middling on a larger scale, but it's not entirely inaccurate either."|Rotten
Pete's Dragon, a remake of a 1977 Disney movie, is a determinedly old-fashioned kids' film, consummately crafted and with a subtlety that brasher, noisier children's movies conspicuously lack.|Fresh
Genuinely enchanting.|Fresh
It is free of cynicism; devoid of pop songs, sassy kids or fart jokes; and centered around concepts of real-life magic and wonderment. This makes Pete's Dragon stand out in the 2016 kid-flick landscape.|Fresh
Most other kids' movies are so frenetic, so manic with lousy jokes and easy gags and visual effluvia that something as calm in spots as Pete's Dragon seems like an outlier.|Fresh
The near-feral child at the center of this movie puts it on the same turf as the remake of The Jungle Book, but Pete's Dragon is a better film in almost every way, and it succeeds where The BFG notably failed.|Fresh
The subtly beautiful Pete's Dragon is a family drama that works because it doesn't talk down to children.|Fresh
[Director David] Lowery may be retreading familiar territory here, but he does it well.|Fresh
This is old-school Disney using 2016 magic.|Fresh
Thanks to director David Lowery's humanizing magic, this tale of an orphan boy and a dragon is that rare family film you really can take to heart.|Fresh
Lowery's affecting tearjerker strips away the excess and keeps on stripping, until all that's left is the elemental friendship between boy and beast and a lovely affirmation of family, community, and the preciousness of the natural world.|Fresh
David Lowery has crafted a beautiful, earnest family film with wonderful emotion and pathos that should see it continually watched for years.|Fresh
None of this works if the dragon isn't convincing, both as an effect and as a character. It is on both counts...|Fresh
A cinematic enchantment, a low-key 1970s-style kids' movie brimming with sincerity and heart. It's one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Elliott breathes fire, and the film around him breathes humanity.|Fresh
A slow movie for kids, and an infuriatingly unconvincing one for adults.|Rotten
Elliot is a simply brilliant creation.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is a fun, unabashedly kid-friendly film that makes old-fashioned, simple storytelling cool again.|Fresh
Every scene snaps and crackles with so much popping energy that we can easily set aside the story's inherent silly parts and be swept along in a vintage formula Walt Disney family movie that works.|Fresh
Your kids are guaranteed to start crying within the film's opening five minutes. That's the bad news. The good news is that they'll stop within its next five as their fear gives way to calming waves of wonder.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon seemed an unlikely choice for a reboot, yet this Dragon is one to believe in.|Fresh
It has a distinct hippie-folktale aesthetic, riffing on the idea that the natural world holds breathtaking secrets if we just know where to look.|Fresh
While it may not be as action-packed or humorous as some have come to expect from the genre, it's still a welcome sight and shows that there's not just magic in the forest, but still some at the multiplex as well.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon has the power to breathe fire into the most tepid of souls.|Fresh
"While ""Pete's Dragon"" does a fine job of evoking the delight one might feel at flying over hill and dale on the back of a mythological creature, it is less successful in rendering real human emotion."|Rotten
Generating at least three irresistible big-hanky sobs in the closing half-hour, Pete's Dragon delivers the emotional punch that The BFG so sorely missed.|Fresh
"Experiencing ""Pete's Dragon"" is like seeing something thought to be extinct, a creation every bit as magical and mythical as the flying, fire-breathing beast it's named after. That would be the straight ahead, unapologetic family film."|Fresh
A sense of fun is notably missing, but the movie works well - maybe too well - as an emotionally wrenching story about a child who must put childhood behind him.|Fresh
A sweet movie with a good message about how magic can be found, if you know where to look.|Fresh
My mini-focus group - Fiona, Joe and Iris - was rapt.|Fresh
The Mouse House has skillfully rummaged through its mothballed back catalog and given a 21st-century makeover to one of its lesser, goofier titles, with magical results.|Fresh
sort of a kiddie Malick|Fresh
While Lowery's soulful, more character-driven adaptation is a refreshing change of pace from the typical summer film, it never really goes anywhere.|Rotten
Kids, grown-ups, and CG creations alike deliver polished, even affecting drama.|Fresh
"""Pete's Dragon"" takes us back not to the 1977 film that loosely inspired it but to the generation before that, when movies for kids were really for kids ..."|Fresh
The film overhauls its source material into a soulful recovery fable for kids, establishing in the process that bad movies-the kind that squander their premises-are much more ripe for remaking than good ones.|Fresh
A stand-out in 2016's summer of reboots, this is a charming fantasy adventure that will make you wish you had a dragon of your own.|Fresh
With the sun-dappled images and the lush forest setting, Lowery aims for a sense of wonder and majesty, but his story never really gets off the ground.|Rotten
"It's a wonderful film, an unexpectedly triumphant reworking of the earlier picture, assembled by a talented and patient production team committed to launching a new ""Pete's Dragon"" that's all heart."|Fresh
With 'Pete's Dragon' you sense a rare opportunity for a Disney classic slipped through the filmmakers' fingers.|Fresh
This is one of the season's most heartening surprises.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is a work of delicacy and joy and profound empathy, a film made by a corporation for a mass audience that somehow manages to be lyrical. Against all odds, it's exquisite.|Fresh
As remakes go, Disney's latest might just be their best one yet, soaring to such stratospheric heights I almost can't help but be amazed.|Fresh
It's not merely a throwback... but one that recaptures the endearing qualities with which the best of its models won over audiences.|Fresh
"Pete's Dragon is a nice little Disney film, and my use of the words ""nice"" and ""little"" is in no way intended to be dismissive."|Fresh
The Disney remake of Pete's Dragon is a heartwarming, 3-D, eco-friendly fairy tale about saving forests and believing in magical things that are not always easy to see.|Fresh
A film of uncommon warmth, decency, and humanity.|Fresh
"There should be more American family movies like ""Pete's Dragon."" Since there aren't, we should get behind this one."|Fresh
Lowery's new take on Pete's Dragon embraces a certain kind of vintage, willing and able to believe in far-fetched magic. No video cameras, no VCRs, no Snapchat. It's just a tall tale about a boy and his best friend, a fuzzy green dragon.|Fresh
It's heartfelt and beautiful in its simplicity, ending with a series of perfect moments that will cement it as a true Disney classic.|Fresh
"The new ""Pete's Dragon"" could be another pox on the multiplexes; instead it's closer to the cure."|Fresh
To borrow the tagline of Superman I, you'll believe a dragon can fly. You'll even believe he can feel.|Fresh
After an opening that briefly borders on shocking, David Lowery's remake of the 1977 film keeps its enormous paws safely on the beaten path.|Rotten
I'm not sure who begged for a Pete's Dragon reboot, but I'm glad they did so Disney could show how to properly revamp an existing property.|Fresh
Where the original was a goofy, campy bit of stylized storytelling, Lowery's becomes a nicely realized, feel-good love song to fantasy and magic.|Fresh
This is one of the season's most heartening surprises.|Fresh
All one needs to grasp is the hope and inherent magic of a kid and a dragon being BFFs, then let the feels flow from there.|Fresh
A heart-warming tale of friendship (bringing to mind Spike Jonze's Where The Wild Things Are) loaded with ecological themes that is more robust and rousing than the 1977 original.|Fresh
Disney's update of Pete's Dragon isn't nearly as whimsical as the original, but stands on its own with heart and meaning.|Fresh
The movie feels like a rock coated in cotton candy, a shiny object that simulates human-type emotions but never truly earns them.|Rotten
While undoubtedly engaging, there's a distinct lack of enchantment that the story deserves.|Fresh
A comforting throwback to the studio's days of dependable family fare.|Fresh
Sylan, stately and slow...almost magical.|Fresh
This modern version, directed with Spielbergian charm and mystery by indie filmmaker David Lowery, can cast a spell on anyone whether they're familiar with the original or not.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is a terrific film for the entire family, full of magic, wonder, and joy.|Fresh
Just because you CAN remake a piece of crap like this does not mean that it's a good idea.|Rotten
An uplifting tale that will resonate with anyone who has ever experienced love and loss.|Fresh
"A quality live-action feature conjuring the kind of brazzle-dazzle spell for which Disney is known and cherished. Musical numbers or not, ""Pete's Dragon"" is pretty enchanting."|Fresh
More like a pleasant walk in a redwood forest with a boy and his dragon than a rollicking adventure, but its serenity and warm heart are infectious.|Fresh
"'Pete's Dragon' is the best ""big"" movie of the summer."|Fresh
It may seem absurd that a creature from the Dark Ages could be hiding out just a quick car ride from Portland. But then Lowery takes you into the green hush of those dark woods and you believe.|Fresh
All the nostalgic Spielberg-y-ness of 'Stranger Things', minus the creepy kids with paranormal nosebleeds.|Fresh
Instead of straining to modernise the tale or weaponise the schmaltz, [Lowery] utilises old-school charm and a timeless sense of place.|Fresh
The quality of Disney's wholesome movie-fare for children is skyrocketing. When Pete has to say goodbye to his dragon, I guarantee your eyes will explode tears. Wonderful stuff.|Fresh
"What ""Pete's Dragon"" lacks in original plot, it makes up for in heart, a satisfying Disney hug delivered with a modern Mowgli and his magical monster."|Fresh
Subplots including environmental consciousness for kids never materialize enough for this mostly somber tall tale, to latch on to a clearing out of these woods. Not to mention a little Paul Bunyan pick-me-up that might have lightened up the proceedings.|Rotten
Elliot is a triumph, a new ideal for fantasy creatures.|Fresh
What Lowery's remake does best is convey classic Disney magic in a family film that's as uplifting for kids as it is for adults.|Fresh
Dull at times but otherwise fine, this fantasy remake tends to excel from the realism instilled into its animated title character.|Fresh
The film is confident enough in its own weatherbeaten skin to take on no more plot than is strictly necessary, and its most affecting scenes are all character-driven moments with no real bearing on the story.|Fresh
The result is part ET, part Jungle Book, part Peanuts. It's sweet and soulful and Spielberg-ish, but with a bitter streak.|Fresh
Rather more plodding than a story involving an invisible fire-breathing wyvern really should be, all things considered.|Rotten
The candy-coloured elements of the 1977 original have gone but, perhaps inevitably for Disney, traces of sticky sentiment remain in this otherwise enjoyably earthy re-imagining of Pete's Dragon.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is stuffed full of heart, wild emotion and an overflowing love of nature.|Fresh
The 1977 original definitely wasn't Disney on top form, but this 2016 'reimagining' of the orphan boy-meets-dragon tale certainly doesn't set the screen alight.|Rotten
Pete's Dragon is a remake in all the right ways, taking cues from the original but reimagining the story for a very different audience living in a very different era.|Fresh
Strong performances and direction make the most of a lightweight tale.|Fresh
More than anything, this is a slice-of-life tale, whisper-thin but still full of feeling and a generous sense of place. With the world's most adorable dragon at the center of it all.|Fresh
It abandons its subtlety and sense of mystery en route to becoming a typically moralistic screed about the preservation of the nuclear family, alongside an obvious but never-quite-resolved cautionary tale about the importance of conservation.|Rotten
Pete's Dragon is an excellent entry in Disney's catalog of live-action remakes... [A]s American folktales go, it's the best I've heard in a long, long time.|Fresh
Technically smart and emotionally intelligent, with this endearing bauble of a film containing a big beating heart inside.|Fresh
A warm, wistful, and wholly wonderful remake of a 1977 Disney musical that today's kids have never heard of and yesterday's kids have long since forgotten.|Fresh
"One of the year's most delightful moviegoing surprises, a quality family film that rewards young people's imaginations and reminds us of a time when the term ""Disney movie"" meant something ..."|Fresh
"This ""Pete's Dragon"" boasts a gentle, subdued tone, and the filmmaker behind the atmospheric indie ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"" has crafted a follow-up with the same folkloric quality."|Fresh
Pete's Dragon is a better Super 8.|Fresh
Pete's Dragon has an emotional sensitivity, aesthetic clarity, and all-around sense of fun that creates what feels like an unearned miracle in the current summer tentpole season.|Fresh
