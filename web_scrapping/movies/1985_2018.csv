The writer-director offers no easy solutions, relying instead on a stellar cast and nuanced responses.|Fresh
Tan shoots stylishly in black and white 16mm, each frame a tasteful photograph. What's most skilful, though, is the way he succeeds in complicating archetypes.|Fresh
The dark inky frames are full of shadows and dread. Yet the narrative, and Adrian's journey, is always leavened with quiet compassion.|Fresh
A poignant footnote to a monumental crisis.|Fresh
"Writer-director Yen Tan, expanding a same-subject short film, takes his tale slowly, letting the drama breathe and the cast essay ""being"" rather than ""acting""."|Fresh
A touching film that becomes both an emotional requiem for a lost generation of gay men and a heartfelt declaration that things could only get better.|Fresh

[I] appreciate that Tan embraces complexity, flaws, and compassion when he could have ignored them for a bow-tied catharsis.|Fresh
It's a beautifully acted film. In the dark days of the epidemic it would surely have been impossible to make a drama so balanced, so compassionately attuned to everyone's feelings.|Fresh
An immaculately drawn drama|Fresh
The lessons being taught in 1985 are admirable, the performances top-notch, and the filmmaking stellar.|Fresh
What makes 1985 such a heartbreaking film is its refusal to contextualize Adrian's suffering against the ongoing AIDS epidemic.|Fresh
It would have been called groundbreaking had it been made in the titular year, but in 2018 it comes across like a throwback to an earlier time, and not an especially compelling one.|Rotten
Even as it's grounded with real-life humour, this is a deeply important film that plays like a yearning cry to cut through the silence and piety.|Fresh
The scope of the film is small and the locations limited, yet its ambition is big.......The sensitive performances and the black and white super 16 cinematography add poignancy and gravity to the intimate interactions between these characters.|Fresh

The black and white of this film feels like an easy filter draped around the elements in the frame, hoping to grant them the gravitas that the elements themselves can't radiate.|Rotten
An unsurprising but touchingly played elegy for a generation wrestling with being gay and having AIDS.|Fresh
The movie doesn't hold any surprises, though it's a useful reminder for younger members of the LGBTQ community who don't know what a scary, sad time the 1980s were.|Fresh
1985 may moralize a bit, but the film is quite moving. Smith gives a strong, subtle performance, and Madsen is heartbreaking as his mom. Bring Kleenex.|Fresh
1985 is a miracle of a film, one that pays tribute to an era, a generation past, and a culture that fueled the progress of LGBTQ civil rights for decades to come.|Fresh
1985 is an incredibly moving film from writer-director Yen Tan.|Fresh
it's a story that's been told before, of course, and not everything works - but there are nice surprises in the script,|Fresh
Relying heavily on the personal over the historical, Tan has crafted a stunning love letter in memoriam for the queer big brothers who could not be there to tell him what Adrian tells Andrew.|Fresh
"Despite the subject matter, ""1985"" rarely dips into maudlin territory. It wisely chooses instead to celebrate unconditional love and the notion that what we have in common is greater than what divides us."|Fresh
Yen Tan's miracle of a film masterfully sets a heartbreaking, small-scaled familial story against the massive backdrop of the AIDS crisis.|Fresh
1985 gets the notes right, and its foreboding look takes us back to a dark age. It's a lesson worth remembering. Yet with all the prejudice and pain, the film still feels a lot like a sermon.|Fresh
Anchored by a deeply felt central performance from Cory Michael Smith, the modest but affecting film should find a receptive niche with LGBT audiences.|Fresh
