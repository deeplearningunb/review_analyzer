"Park clearly delights in the occasionally ridiculous levels of decadence he heaps on this layer cake of deception and deceit, but ""The Handmaiden"" shows the filmmaker's genuine tenderness as a real, if tortured love story forms at its core."|Fresh
Chan-Wook Park's latest masterpiece is a film that really fire on so many different levels of brilliance - incredibly sexy in some moments, astoundingly disgusting in others; strongly dramatic and then building in unbearable tension.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is not only one of Chan-wook Park's best films, it is also his funniest. Actress Kim Tae-ri is officially a star.|Fresh
It would be a shame to spoil any of the silky curves of the story but sufficed to say that silver bells aren't just for Christmas time in the city anymore.|Fresh
The consistently strong cast and the roving camera that gives you a wide-angle tour of a half-Victorian, half-Japanese mansion-and the sex and violence-keeps things moving for a two-and-a-half hour ride that never gets boring.|Fresh
The film on its own has enough intriguing atmosphere, great performances, production design, and style to recommend it on the whole, but The Handmaiden constantly flirts with being too much of a good thing.|Fresh
Once again Park finds himself immersed in a world of woman-driven intrigue, and like Stoker before it The Handmaiden is concerned with the power dynamics between women in what are contextually configured as sexually transgressive scenarios.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is a triumphant project, pacing its plot well in order to stay engrossing for the whole of its runtime, and creating a dark and twisted piece of cinema that is an imaginative take on an English Victorian-set novel.|Fresh

May be silly and slight, but it often strikes the right nerve.|Fresh
... Park Chan-wook does what all excellent filmmakers strive to do- create a technically engrossing and emotionally compelling story that resonates with its audience far after the credits are finished rolling.|Fresh
[Director] Park Chan-wook is a poet of the realm of the flesh.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is, above all, a delightful exercise in changing perspectives and sympathies. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
a sumptuous, sensual world of illusion and treachery designed by Park and his characters to seduce and entrap - and here eros most certainly trumps pornography.|Fresh
A solid entry, a brutal Dickensian movie from South Korea.|Fresh
Park's compromise-a tastefully arranged melodrama with elements of kitsch-is as incoherent as it is fetching.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is a GORGEOUS film, wonderfully acted by its three leads, with a twisty plot that will, at least once, elicit real shock.|Fresh
It's stylish and both Kims are terrific, but it's a long slog.|Fresh
The plot is deliciously twisted, while perceptions and truths are consistently challenged.|Fresh
If technology is the great mirror of our era, Black Mirror as a television show is the long gaze into our own reflections.|Fresh
[The Handmaiden is] gorgeously shot and composed, audacious, and full of witty visual asides.|Fresh
The stylized acting requires Min-hee Kim as Lady Hideko, Kim Tae-ri as Sook-Hee and Jung-woong Jo as Fujiwara to convey volumes with silence, glances, and gestures, and they succeed admirably.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is exemplary proof of Park's mastery, a high point from a director known for his purposeful aesthetic care, even in matters of overwrought sexual melodrama.|Fresh
It's a brilliantly dark ode to women's desire and autonomy: a subject that remains as pressing today as it was a century ago.|Fresh
The tricksy plot streamlines and improves the final messy section of the source novel, to tease and mislead even the most astute viewer.|Fresh
... the look of a lavish period drama, the elegance of an arthouse film, the complex plotting of an ingenious caper that only the movies could sustain, and the sex of a classy softcore picture.|Fresh
If one wasn't swayed by Oldboy or [Chan-Wook's] underrated English-language debut Stoker, The Handmaiden may be the one to convince audiences of this remarkable talent.|Fresh
A twisty, twisted, psycho-sexual thriller, in which, for all its explicit content, nothing is quite as it appears.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is sensuous rather than lurid, an erotic thriller with a sense of humour and more than a few twists up its sleeve.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is stylish, funny and daring enough to keep you gripped to the end.|Fresh
There are giddy pleasures to be found in this rip-roaringly ripe erotic thriller/melodrama from Oldboy director Park Chan-wook.|Fresh
An astonishing erotic melodrama.|Fresh
The claustrophobic richness of the world he (Park Chan-wook) creates... lingers in the mind more even than the plot. His film presents a cloistered, colonial system, burned down by women's lust and love.|Fresh
The result is a lush, silken, erotic, disturbing, beautifully photographed drama of betrayal and passion.|Fresh
The intrigue, shifting alliances, and twisted revenge? Delicious, pulpy fun. The male-gazey soft-core porn that undermines the female protagonists? Not so much.|Rotten
The urge for a second viewing struck me midway through the first.|Fresh
A sprawling, elaborate and labyrinthine tale of intrigue and deception, told as a battle of wills between the sexes, this is a glorious journey through the darker recesses of human desire.|Fresh
The whole enterprise is presented with such breathtaking panache, intricacy and humour that it's impossible to resist.|Fresh
Sexy, beautiful and constantly surprisingly, The Handmaiden is a satisfying period drama.|Fresh
In this hyper-intricate construction of false leads and surprise reversals, the ultimate dupe - and a very willing one - is the viewer.|Fresh
It is certainly a brilliant adaptation of Sarah Waters' original novel and a film about something that most other movies can only guess at: pleasure and rapture.|Fresh
Lushly photographed, dizzyingly erotic thriller-slash-love story that's full of delicious twists and turns.|Fresh
A complex and wonderfully decadent erotic melodrama.|Fresh
Plots twist and twist again, but the true surprise is the film's grasp of power between classes, and sexes, colonial and colonised. Nestled here too is a charge of real emotion.|Fresh
A ravishing period piece that simmers with sexual tension while pulling off some dazzling narrative gymnastics.|Fresh
A genuinely fun blend of sumptuous visuals and a perverse sense of humour.|Fresh
Much as Lady Hideko's house is a clash of Western and Japanese architecture that somehow coalesces, so The Handmaiden mixes classical, formal composition with Park's typically twisted cinematic outlook.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is at once a superlative thriller and a deeply erotic character study, but it's the intelligence, mordant wit and depth of characterisation that are the real turn-ons.|Fresh
A gloriously sensual and impressively layered thriller that's every bit as Hitchcockian and gothic as its predecessor.|Fresh
[Park] has taken what could have been an ordinary and genteel costume drama and transformed it into an electrifying work that is in equal parts smart, bizarre, darkly funny, violent, powerfully acted and genuinely erotic.|Fresh
There's clearly an audience for this kind of high-concept erotic twaddle, but if Park changes tack for his next film, I won't complain. He's having fun here; he's also only a few shades away from E.L. James.|Fresh
Perhaps not since 'Pulp Fiction' have I seen such a cleverly convoluted story woven together from different perspectives. Act two and three pile on more layers of detail, adding more richness to the story.|Fresh
... has the look of a lavish period drama, the elegance of an arthouse film, the complex plotting of an ingenious caper that only the movies could sustain, and the sex of a classy softcore picture.|Fresh
Like everything by Korean auteur Park Chan-wook, The Handmaiden is meticulously controlled in form and bonkers-crazy in content. That's a heady combo.|Fresh
Intelligent, absorbing and erotic.|Fresh
It combines Chan-wook's best obsessions: his aesthetic virtuosity, his dark sense of humor, his interest of sex as an unstoppable force and his characters penchant for vengeance. [Full review in Portuguese.]|Fresh
Fan of [Park's] will no doubt be sucked in by the distinct style, cinematography, and lush colors.|Fresh
A wonderfully twisted web of rococo theatrics, melodramatic twists, and deliciously lurid storytelling.|Fresh
Even the most sensational sequences in The Handmaiden fail to do much more than disrupt the plot line.|Rotten
The ending doesn't live up to what precedes it, but while it's working, this is some of the most captivating and effective cinema of 2016, or indeed any of the last several years.|Fresh
The Handmaiden may not be the most concise effort we've seen from Chan-Wook as a director, but it's still an absolute masterpiece all the same.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is a melodrama that delivers on its twists and turns.|Fresh
Although The Handmaiden could easily rest on its violent, sexy laurels, Park and what must have been an army of set decorators, prop masters and costumers have created a dense, fully-realized world.|Fresh
...the more we unfold of its mystery, the deeper we fall into suspicion, desire, and depravity.|Fresh
A relentlessly beautiful film and one of the decade's most exhilarating and satisfying love stories.|Fresh
The triangle that ensues is voraciously sexual, unabashedly fetishistic. And the crosses, and the double-crosses, and the twists-within-twists are almost as carnal in their voluptuousness.|Fresh
An atypically swoon-worthy Park Chan-wook creation, he spins the script's elaborate gears to craft an alluring parable on oppressive class and gender roles.|Fresh
An intricate story that mixes Gothic melodrama with the folklore of revenge and the libertine novel. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Narratively complex and scabrously amusing, The Handmaiden remakes the period epic into a study of personal power told through both sexual and colonial politics and batty heist flick diversions.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is Park Chan-Wook's best directorial effort since Oldboy, a near perfect blend of awesome visual style and engaging narrative.|Fresh
An excellent film that knows how to use the surprises to elevate everything else instead of compensating for possible shortcomings. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that stands out for its perversion, protagonists, tempo, narrative tricks, and that modulates the question of how to be able to dominate the flow of glances. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Sexy, sly ""Handmaiden"" a fun piece of deception."|Fresh
It's undoubtedly a masterpiece.|Fresh
A fascinating tale of deception and double-crosses.|Fresh
A visually exuberant film with a seductively perverse story that takes us from the exciting curiosity of the beginning to a growing and sustained perplexity. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of the best, most unexpected movies of the year.|Fresh
A human drama loaded with love, passion, libido and social problems, where its director reinvents himself. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Every shot is stunning, and many are breathtaking ... With its twisty-turny plot, stunning visuals and lashings of explicit lady-on-lady sex, [it] is probably [Park's] most accessible film to date. Great fun and an experiential feast.|Fresh
"While ""Oldboy"" contained a whopper of a twist, ""The Handmaiden"" tells its story in more measured strokes, and yet is no less lurid or powerful."|Fresh
Love conquers all in this beautiful movie, but it's not pretty.|Fresh
Chan-wook [delivers] a marvel of storytelling sleight of hand worthy of euphoric admiration.|Fresh
Park chan-wook is brilliant in conveying a subtle and quiet tale of running from pain and sadness, while injecting much of what makes his films stand out from every other auteur working today.|Fresh
This nasty, perverted, and highly enjoyable erotic thriller is the most ferocious movie about matters of the heart since Dangerous Liaisons.|Fresh
One of the year's more delightfully offbeat and pleasurable films.|Fresh
this is film that should not be taken lightly. It will seep into the dark places of your psyche, and titillate your moral compass in disturbing yet delightful ways.|Fresh
A thriller that is the most fun you can have watching steamy sex on the big screen.|Fresh
A rich, intoxicating epic of chicanery and deceit-a puzzle that entangles the viewer just as it does its characters.|Fresh
A conspicuously crafty tale...Park's erotic thriller...with its story that, not coincidentally, deals with fetishes-never feels lifelessly premeditated; rather, we realize, early and often, that we are in very sure hands.|Fresh
The most sexually charged movie of the year.|Fresh
Elegant and erotic, an elusive, yet exquisite example of sybaritic Asian cinema.|Fresh
The flourishes of brutality, the pageantry of hardcore, the punchlines and slapstick gags: what's all this doing in an otherwise earnest film about deception and love?|Rotten
Twisted tale from Chan-wook Park is Korean hybrid Gothic pleasure.|Fresh
It holds its rapturous tease over us with scrumptious visuals, artful poise and dips into kink and gore that would give the Marquis de Sade reason to smile.|Fresh
Kinky by design, artful by intent, the film draws visual inspiration from Gothic erotic art while distilling its screenplay - Chung Seo-kyung and Park share co-script - from the Sarah Waters Victorian crime novel Fingersmith.|Fresh
Park Chan-wook's elegantly mounted Gothic story surprisingly combines sensuous melodrama and a delightfully full-blown romanticism.|Fresh
A bit too long and too twisty, but this is a beautifully mounted a large-scale epic drama. (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
Just when we figure out where it's going, it goes somewhere else. Just when we think it won't dare go somewhere, it does.|Fresh
Co-writer/director Chan-wook Park's The Handmaiden is an invigorating exercise in shifting perspectives and sympathies.|Fresh
Park's Handmaiden is a great big chocolate box of a movie in which a rich and satisfying narrative is enlivened by some piquant erotica and the sharp tang of politics.|Fresh
A sexy, stylish, surprisingly intelligent thriller that demands to be seen at least twice.|Fresh
"""The Handmaiden"" is 145 minutes of clever, erotic entertainment."|Fresh
You have to stay on your toes while watching The Handmaiden. Like each of its central characters, Park Chan-wook's nimble erotic thriller has an agenda. And the South Korean auteur is always one step ahead of you.|Fresh
While The Handmaiden is an empirically gorgeous movie no matter what's happening on screen, it also has no business being two-and-a-half hours long. It loses its momentum in the third act -- but lordy, those first two acts.|Fresh
craft in every scene and through every swerve is absolutely spellbinding.|Fresh
How seriously can we take the film's rejection of systematic male oppression when it so blatantly objectifies its women?|Rotten
It's a fine effort from a justifiably lauded creative force who lives to toy with his audience, often employing gruesome developments to do so.|Fresh
Uncomfortable squirms, not titillation, seem the only reasonable response to ... the whole point of the movie.|Rotten
It may not be what viewers expect from Park Chan-wook -- it's even better.|Fresh
An engaging and evocative thriller/love story, The Handmaiden is ultimately a tale of freedom and transformation, as satisfying as an exquisitely choreographed four-course meal.|Fresh
"Everything in ""The Handmaiden"" is ripe, sensual, rich. There's no beauty in chopping off fingers, it's true. But it can be artfully done."|Fresh
There may not be a director currently working who's more of an evil genius, or whose movies offer more double-edged delights.|Fresh
"""The Handmaiden"" is a fever dream from South Korean virtuoso Park Chan-wook, bursting with the kind of goodies that send cinephiles into ecstasy."|Fresh
"You have, I promise, never seen a movie quite like Park Chan-wook's ""The Handmaiden."""|Fresh
The Handmaiden is an undeniably lush, meticulously constructed film whose celebration of perversity is among the most artful you'll see.|Fresh
A shot of both beauties from behind, their hair in twin twists, feels like Park playing to porn fantasies. Yet he respects them as individuals, even when we're not sure who they really are|Fresh
A deliciously black-humored erotic thriller ... with sex scenes so steamy and cruelty so gratuitous that you have to smile at the filmmaker's cheerful perversity.|Fresh
"""The Handmaiden"" hails from South Korea, but compared to most American movies of its scale and budget, it might as well have been made on another planet."|Fresh
Despite its flaws, the Handmaiden is worth a watch for its complex female characters, its captivating plot, and the gorgeous costumes and scenery.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is a nearly flawless movie. Every frame, every movement of the camera, every performance feels perfectly calibrated for maximum effect.|Fresh
'The Handmaiden' delivers a spellbinding tale of love, betrayal and revenge.|Fresh
The level of craft is so consistently high that it's impossible to be anything less than entertained.|Fresh
The film runs nearly two-and-a-half-hours, but that's just the right amount of time for Park to turn up the heat a few degrees at a time.|Fresh
While it's shallow and melodramatic, there's also an intoxicating quality to the imagery and the storytelling that keeps it compelling throughout.|Fresh
Absolutely gorgeous, with so much attention paid to every visual detail from the costumes to the mansion's many rooms.|Fresh
Like Park's best work, it's an expressionistic, at times surreal movie that skates along the knife-edge of dreams. Every frame pulses with life, sometimes with blood.|Fresh
This breathless feminist thriller has the refined style of an art film but offers the disreputable fun of a guilty pleasure.|Fresh
the fine art of erotic manipulation is gleefully on display|Fresh
With this astonishing adaptation Chan-wook has taken his unique blend of brutality, beauty, humor and heart to dizzying new heights.|Fresh
Like a Victorian settee infested with vipers, Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden mixes the elegant and the dangerous, the refined and the venomous; it affects refinement and crawls on its belly. It's also apt to bite.|Fresh
"The art of the tease is rarely as refined as in ""The Handmaiden."""|Fresh
Eschewing his usual modus operandi for the rollicking tension of active kink, Park finds a percolating balance between sensuality and sin, and it might just win him admirers beyond the usual bloodthirsty fanboys.|Fresh
A teasingly witty and elegant puzzle-box of a thriller whose pleasures are rooted not in visceral shock but in narrative surprise, and which wisely opts to seduce rather than pulverize its audience.|Fresh
"The tasteful and the trashy make acrobatic bedfellows in Park Chan-wook's ""The Handmaiden,"" a movie so assured it can do a sex scene where the camerawork is as arresting as the bodies engaged in combat."|Fresh
Both actresses deliver vivid, tender performances; they generate all the movie's fire, but they're obliged to do it inside a chilly, ritualized framework, the aesthetic equivalent of a softcore mausoleum.|Rotten
[The Handmaiden,] Park Chan-wook's Korean- and Japanese-language take on Welsh novelist Sarah Waters's Victorian-set romantic thriller Fingersmith, may be the best adaptation of this year. It is certainly the most innovative.|Fresh
Park seizes on the story's potent combination of larceny and taboo sexuality, and his steamy love scenes are enhanced by Seong-hie Ryu's sumptuous set decor.|Fresh
"Lush, kinky, twisty and erotic, writer/director Park Chan-wook springs back from his gorgeous but emotionally anemic ""Stoker,"" returning to the warped mind games, three act structure and cephalopod mollusc of ""Oldboy""...a delirious cinematic experience"|Fresh
Give Park the chance work you into a lather over the course of 145 minutes. There are few filmmakers on Earth capable of crafting the experience of movies like The Handmaiden so exquisitely while maintaining both plot inertia and a sense of fun.|Fresh
Director Park Chan-wook has always had a stunningly cinematic eye, but he's better known for gouging someone else's out. In The Handmaiden, he demonstrates a lightness and humor unseen in his previous work.|Fresh
Sure, Park might be at Peak Male Gaze here, but he's also telling a dazzling, darkly comic story about two women fed up with the patriarchy.|Fresh
The Handmaiden, while a visually dazzling feast for the senses, seems to be on a mission to tell its already elaborate story in the most intricate fashion imaginable.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is a captivating and beautiful story of two underestimated women manipulating the manipulators.|Fresh
Elegant, intensely romantic... The visual equivalent of drinking three glasses of champagne in the bath.|Fresh
The secret of the film, I suspect, is its love of secrets. The men and women guard their stratagems like jewels, and their lusts like hidden fires.|Fresh
Few directors can so instantly draw your attention to the screen the way Park can.|Fresh
Led by two fantastic lead performances, The Handmaiden is smart, sadistic and sexy as hell.|Fresh
With The Handmaiden, Park Chan-wook has made a gigantic leap as an artist, but he retreats to lurid cartoonishness just as he's earned your trust.|Fresh
Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden is a chef-d'oeuvre of intrigue and erotica. It is a sumptuously artistic tale, exquisitely shot, that will leave you breathless.|Fresh
A bold, beautiful and way-out-there female revenge story that eschews the bloodless nature of most costume dramas to revel in the lusty passions, kinky hobbies and digit-dicing proclivities of its main characters.|Fresh
Whether this is Park's best film is up for debate, but it could be in the running for your new favourite.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is part romance, part gothic fairy tale and part psychosexual chamber piece, an initially beguiling film whose heavy-handed love scenes work to undermine its dramatic power.|Fresh
A darkly comic study in sex, class and Japanese-Korean relations.|Fresh
Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden is for lovers: of others, of South Korean cinema and, most importantly, of psychosexual mind games. Finally, something for everyone.|Fresh
Female leads Kim Min-hee and Kim Tae-ri are both standouts, conveying the complexity of the film's multi-layered con games with subtle changes of facial expression and tone of voice.|Fresh
The love scenes between Sook-hee and Hideko are beautiful, explicit, and funny, displaying a candor about sexuality that's not intended to shock but to draw you in-it's the most normal thing about this flamboyant, acerbic film.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is another masterpiece from Park Chan-wook - a story of love, betrayal, and deceit that is beautiful, funny, romantic, and sexy.|Fresh
Park plays fast and loose with expectations, with a shape-shifting plot that's as ornate as the art direction- a mirrored dollhouse of seduction, deception and fatal attraction.|Fresh
"The Handmaiden is a sexy, seductive ""thriller"" that attempts to play the multiple-perceptions game, but misses on being a masterclass because of its daunting length."|Fresh
He's in such supreme command of his craft that to watch 'The Handmaiden' is to watch a man drunk on the joy of movie-making - and to share the same buzz.|Fresh
'The Handmaiden' is thoughtful and complex while also being immensely entertaining, funny, dark, and disturbing.It's the kind of masterful work we've come to expect from Park Chan-wook.|Fresh
By replacing the class system of Victorian England with the dynamic of the occupier and occupied, Park has tapped into something uniquely complex about a chapter of history that is rarely explored.|Fresh
A pervy, picture-perfect period piece.|Fresh
Park goes all-out in series of gratuitous, nearly explicit, sex scenes. That's not in itself such a bad thing, but when he opts for a severely sadistic sequence near the end, he goes too far.|Rotten
An appealing world which has been built upon the bowels of Hell, a spectacular drama with fierce performances and fiery sensuality.|Fresh
Park's adaptation of [Fingersmith] has its own unpredictability. And while it's still largely the same story, there are points where this new interpretation takes its own direction and charges ahead without so much as a look behind.|Fresh
... the film practically drips with fetishistic imagery and detail.|Fresh
One part Gothic fantasy, one part softcore thriller... blurs the line between highbrow and sexploitation so skilfully you will be left wondering if you just watched a big-budget skin flick or a particularly smutty arthouse production.|Fresh
Billed by some as a lurid lesbian potboiler when it premiered in Cannes, The Handmaiden is much more lavish than this reductive description suggests.|Fresh
[CANNES 2016] Lush production designs and keen cinematography drink in dynamic performances (by Kim Min-Hee and Kim Tae-Ri) teeming with an urgent lesbian sensuality.|Fresh
The Handmaiden is sexy and twisty and so compelling despite this, lodging itself in the points of view of two women who are constantly underestimated by the men around them, and who learn to take advantage of how they're misjudged.|Fresh
Practically every surface in the film screams fetish, and, as in his underrated Stoker, Chan-Wook locates eroticism in some unusual places.|Fresh
... the film is a handsomely opaque, overtly familiar, sexually evocative romance that never bores you and yet, throughout, I felt like something was missing.|Fresh
The Korean filmmaker makes a great comeback with his transgressive adaptation of one of the most notorious authors of homosexual fiction. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An intelligent, funny erotic thriller, The Handmaiden seems destined for some kind of American remake... that isn't likely to live up to Park's invention, wit, and daring. See this one first, if you can.|Fresh
"Starts out looking as if it'll be a deeply serious (and seriously depressing) tale of a Korean ""comfort woman"" forced to service the occupying Japanese military. After about five minutes of grandiose solemnity, Park drops the charade."|Fresh
Park has genre-ised this material right up with a lip-smacking, borderline pervy glee, but leaves us with relationships that only sketchily make sense.|Rotten
Manages to surprise us in almost every scene, every frame.|Fresh
The film is not all bad -and ensures another surprise at the end-, but by that time you'll be already tired of a story that might well have been resolved in 100 minutes without exaggerating the visual stylization. [Full review in spanish]|Rotten
The Handmaid gives all the preciousness and virtuosity to the montage, framing and lighting that are the hallmark of the South Korean filmmaker. [Full review in spanish]|Fresh

Park shows more subtelty and an obvious growth in his craft as a filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The movie works, but in the end the idea of more style over matter lingers around. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Chan-wook recreates in a stylish way all the parts of a story whose dramatic entity is much more elemental than what you can see at first glance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Deliriously fun, terminally silly.|Fresh
Exquisitely designed and sexually liberating, this is a hugely entertaining thriller that has shades of Gaslight, Les Diaboliques and last year's Duke of Burgundy, but thankfully no grey.|Fresh
The film manages the tricky feat of both staying true to Waters breathless, page-turning prose, and creating a wholly persuasive new milieu for the story.|Fresh
Clever, heady and sensually lavish to a fault.|Fresh
All the best things about Asian cinema, rolled into one.|Fresh
It's slow to start, but once things start to move along and come together, the journey is riotous, depraved, and delightful.|Fresh
