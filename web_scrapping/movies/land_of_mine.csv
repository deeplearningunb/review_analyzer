Director Martin Zandvliet combines gripping tension and powerful emotion in this accomplished war thriller.|Fresh
It may be made with the subtlety of an unexpected explosion, but the aftereffects are harrowing and lasting.|Fresh
Land of Mines seems to want to tell us that when a war ends, another deeply buried mine also must be defused: hatred of the other.|Fresh
Land of Mine is a refreshing surprise that deserves its nomination at the Oscars simply by being humane, heartfelt, and shocking without feeling necessary to delve into the platitudes of glorifying heroics.|Fresh
"It's a conscientious, handsome drama in the middlebrow humanitarian tradition, but it makes obvious use of the easy option: whenever a new tragic jolt is needed, a mine can go ""boom!"""|Fresh
Land of Mine is small but powerfully formed.|Fresh

[Land of Mine] poses wrenching emotional questions, and shows how the battles of war rage on long after a victor has been declared.|Fresh
Denmark's so-called biggest war crime forms the historical backdrop of this nerve-jangling bomb-disposal drama|Fresh
A tough, well-made war movie - sometimes shockingly violent - about a little known and very grim moment at the end of the second world war.|Fresh
A thoughtful, poignant story that deservedly won Mller the Danish equivalent of the Bafta best actor prize.|Fresh
Land of Mine is bolstered by great performances ... both from the young German cast and, especially, from Roland Mller as their terrifying, but increasingly empathetic, Danish commander.|Fresh
The sense of place is as assured as the vigilant performances, while the defusing sequences are genuinely suspenseful.|Fresh
A poignant and worthy tribute to a little-known postscript of World War Two.|Fresh
Bringing to light a little known and far from honourable chapter of Danish history, this is convincingly acted and insanely tense.|Fresh
A thoughtful, poignant drama that is comfortably carried on the shoulders of an ebullient, heartfelt performance from Mller ...|Fresh
A film that maintains the tension almost throughout its length, as well as the embarrassment and the humiliations that the soldiers experience like prisoners, but mainly to the work that realize. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
His taste for revenge sours. And watching someone move through that kind of transformation - very, very gently, unearthing their own rage and defusing its power- brings the whole purpose of this film to the surface.|Fresh
The sometimes manipulative film is perhaps too opaque regarding its own moral context. But its steel-blue skies and dispassionate view of men clinging pointlessly to masculine codes do get under your skin.|Fresh
Zandvliet subordinates suspense and even existential metaphor to unilluminating brotherhood-of-man sentiment...|Rotten
Land of Mine is a gut-punch of a remarkable film, but anyone with even a little sensitivity may not actually enjoy sitting through it.|Fresh
It's a little-known story, powerfully told. The message is both timely and timeless.|Fresh
An affecting film highlighting a little-known story, with the opening reels showing just how strong the impulse for retribution was against the Nazis.|Fresh
A particularly intense and unsettling watch.|Fresh
Zandvliet's film succeeds mostly because of Mller.|Fresh
"(Mller""s) portrayal of a crusty sergeant rediscovering his humanity doesn't quite excuse the clichs that fill Land of Mine, but it makes the experience bearable."|Fresh
The stakes in Land of Mine are certainly high, and the situation is urgent. Nonetheless, Zandvliet has trouble getting the story to move. While it's easy to see why the lads burst into tears often, 100 minutes of it can get redundant quickly.|Rotten
It zeroes in on a little-known chapter from the post-war era to spin an engaging and emotionally resonant story that, even after 70-plus years of WWII movies, feels fresh.|Fresh
A riveting slice of life in traumatized post war Europe leads to the miracle of human connection.|Fresh
In terms of tension and suspense, who could possibly imagine a better set-up? Writer/director Martin Zandvliet, however, gives us much more than a bloody horrorshow ... [he] forensically examines issues of vengeance, forgiveness, compassion and humanity.|Fresh
Even when Land of Mine charts a predictable path, it remains gripping from start to finish.|Fresh
"Remember how you felt observing the early moments of ""The Hurt Locker,"" itself a bomb-detonating masterpiece (and 2008 Oscar-winner)? This one raises the melodramatic bar even higher. Can you really stand to watch?"|Fresh
There's a certain morbid and manipulative streak to a movie that generates its main suspense over which innocent kid will get blown up next.|Rotten
Its story of innocence lost and humanity found is a strong one.|Fresh
Land Of Mine is... gripping, well-acted by all, and a good, strong tale well told. It's also that uncommon thing: a movie that touches on the theme of redemption without descending into bathos or inanity.|Fresh
Land of Mine is a compelling, fascinating history lesson with a moral that is just as relevant today.|Fresh
It's a harrowing story neatly shaped into melodrama by Danish writer-director Martin Zandvliet.|Fresh
After laying some considerable scripting groundwork in a patience-testing opening act of the movie, Zandvliet transports us deep inside the haunted, hunted psyches of these blighted souls with uncommon sincerity and compassion.|Fresh
A wrenching portrait.|Fresh
A handsomely made, powerfully acted but not particularly probing drama.|Fresh
Melodramatic and predictable in the extreme, but worthwhile|Fresh
"The cinematic theme of ""war is hell"" is an old and often cliched one. Land of Mine defies all those tired tropes and comes up with something searing and hopeful to say about the possibilities of the resilience of the human spirit."|Fresh
...a well-done film about a little-known chapter of history ...|Fresh
Comparisons to The Hurt Locker are unavoidable given the subject matter, but Land of Mine is the better film, and quite possibly an instant classic.|Fresh
It's more a melodrama than a war film, peppered with an indignated suspense shot in scenes with precision. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A story that deserves to be told, although the film constantly reveals its commitment to not cause too many problems - neither moral nor ideological - to its viewers. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Manipulative [but] manages to generate a good deal of suspense, and empathy, from a tale based on actual historical events.|Fresh
If you like moral quandaries, this one presents a doozy. And that's its chief asset.|Fresh
Watching Danish writer-director Martin Zandvliet's debut feature is unnerving, shocking, depressing and scary.|Fresh
As the difficult mission continues, nationalities erase and sympathy emerges. It's doubtful that Zandvliet made Land of Mine to reflect the divisiveness that's now imbued the world. But his film is of the Zeitgeist anyway.|Fresh
Zandvliet isn't above a few unnecessarily manipulative moments, but he handles intense drama with confidence, delivering a WWII saga that's engrossing and harrowing.|Fresh
[A] gripping story of young POWs forced to remove the millions of landmines along the coast of Denmark after World War II.|Fresh
"Gaining in intensity as it moves along, ""Land of Mine"" combines the suspense of Henri-Georges Clouzot's ""Wages of Fear"" (1953) with the psychological complexity of David Lean's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957) ..."|Fresh
Land of Mine is a fictionalized version of a neglected piece of postwar history, detailing the often-ruthless practice of using WWII German prisoners to defuse land mines.|Fresh
It's as powerful a denunciation of nationalism's destructive force as one will see in 2017.|Fresh
Every performance here is deeply felt and quietly heartbreaking-crafting Land of Mine into a measured, often beautiful meditation on moral relevance.|Fresh
"Despite the constant theme of death, ""Land of Mine"" has a hopeful note in the end. It says something about understanding people, not just the ideology that made them enemies."|Fresh
The audience can't help but sympathize with [German] boys during grueling days crawling on the beach defusing mines. ..Vivid reminder of terrible risks mines still pose.|Fresh
It's a harrowing, sensitively realized study of cruelty, revenge and post-war retribution that ranks high among films about the cost of war and its continuing damage to humanity.|Fresh
... mostly avoids heavy-handed contrivances and offers an intriguing perspective on true-life historical events.|Fresh
Land of Mine is absolutely riveting from start to finish, both on a thematic and a visceral level. It tenses your muscles and engages your mind simultaneously.|Fresh
Zandvliet has crafted a handsome, affecting and questioning film about post-war revenge and forgiveness. On a tough field to navigate, he makes it to the other side, commendably.|Fresh
Zandvliet masterfully brings all the elements together to create a suspenseful, sorrowful and memorable tale.|Fresh
For a movie in which anything can explode at any moment, Land Of Mine is awfully predictable.|Fresh
Land of Mine's fitful jolts of suspense can't compensate for the story's wholly familiar trajectory.|Rotten
The loneliness and regret permeating the movie illustrate eternal truths about the lingering consequences of such massive destruction on the everyday individuals tasked with carrying it out.|Fresh
"The visceral excitement of ""Wages of Fear"" combines with a sharp critique of ""Good War"" mythology. Brilliant filmmaking with a moral edge."|Fresh
It's a well-intentioned movie that winds up favoring sentimentality over genuinely disturbing introspection.|Rotten
With its muted colors and naturalistic lighting, the film aptly captures the beauty of seaside locales that frame the human struggle at the story's heart.|Fresh
This well-made drama borrows a little-known sliver of history concerning Denmark's post-war mistreatment of young German POWs forced to defuse and extract land mines.|Fresh
Land of Mine, which overseas bears the title Under the Sand, is a provocative drama that poses timeless questions. It's easy to see why Academy voters chose it as a contender for this year's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.|Fresh
Zandvliet's bleak compositions are particularly striking - soldiers lying facedown on the sand, inching along and fixedly disarming mines, their youthful skin almost one with the pale beach in contrast with dark warning flags dotting the landscape.|Fresh
Land of Mine is essentially bomb porn.|Rotten
A tight and suspenseful film ...|Fresh
An act of expiation, Land of Mine is honorable, harrowing and stirring.|Fresh
This World War II epilogue doesn't break new ground, but its beaches are stunning. So are the bloody lessons it leaves on them.|Fresh
Land Of Mine is tough and admirably grim, turning a harrowing history lesson into a study in how the battles of wartime don't always cease with the ceasefire.|Fresh
The film is sometimes too sentimental, too predictable in its drift, but electric in individual moments.|Fresh
Again and again, its stark and suspenseful compositions strike the eye-figures in dark clothing, prone on a pale beach, with lines of wire, black warning flags, and the chill gray waves beyond.|Fresh
Justifiably chosen as an Oscar semi-finalist, this stunning film demonstrates with appropriate nuance the mixed feelings of a Danish sergeant toward his German captives.|Fresh
Land of Mine carefully sidesteps the clunky pun of its title to tell a powerful, moving story of young men sacrifiiced to war and its equally violent aftermath.|Fresh
It's the journey rather than the destination that's affecting.|Fresh
Yet such lack of character development wouldn't be so significant if it didn't converge with the sidestepping of larger issues.|Rotten
It's clear from the way writer-director Martin Zandvliet sets up the story that the fiery Rasmussen... will eventually soften. It's to the film's credit that he does so in ways that are eminently believable.|Fresh
A classic wide-screen World War II epic but with a number of unsettling twists.|Fresh
The performances are uniformly excellent.|Fresh
Land of Mine is not a conventionally entertaining movie, but it is very well made.|Fresh
In almost every scene, Zandvliet takes the least subtle path of storytelling possible, turning in an overwrought and underdeveloped humanist war drama.|Rotten
