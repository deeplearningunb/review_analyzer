George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is spectacular - a cacophony of automotive carnage unlike anything that has ever graced the big screen.|Fresh
A welcome return by George Miller to the kind of anarchic action he hasn't directed in the three decades since Thunderdome.|Fresh

Like a sublime dieselpunk opera scored for blood, fire, guns and accompanied by an orchestra of insanely tricked-out vehicles.|Fresh
The best action movie I have seen so far this year, and I doubt anything else coming out will be able to top it.|Fresh
The movie fulfils the potential for apocalyptic madness that the original trilogy only promised - you just yearn for more moments of calm before the never-ending storm itself.|Fresh
A thriller whose intensity is driven by emotion as much as it is by motion.|Fresh
Miller adorns every scene with the most astonishing, peculiar imagery and the vehicular action is like nothing you've ever seen.|Fresh
t's by no means a perfect film, but it's an action movie with a heart and a mind, built to do much more than just make you feel as if you've endured a visual pummeling.|Fresh
The thumping drums and booms amp up the film on a whole other level, something I haven't felt since Interstellar. The way the different music was used to signify the arrival of another War Party was a sonic experience I need to see more of.|Fresh
"""Mad Max Fury Road"" is one of the worst and meaningless movies I have ever seen."|Rotten
It's fine B-grade mulch, but it's certainly no masterpiece...it's surprising, and a tad disheartening, how readily Fury Road falls into line with so many other production-line blockbusters.|Fresh
This is one of the few movies I've ever seen where the whole audience broke into spontaneous, loud applause a third of the way in.|Fresh
The entire cast seems handpicked for a kind of cinematic glory that has little to do with what goes on in other blockbusters.|Fresh
In the end, Miller has done it and done it righteously - reimagining a sturdy franchise and living up to the original, while kicking the tired reboot to the curb. Fury Road is rife with activity and fertile with ideas.|Fresh
Charlize Theron as Furiosa is freaking amazing in this film. She fights, she's badass, she's so great.|Fresh
I left the theatre trembling and with my hands sweating, and that's the best compliment one can give to a movie of this kind. Let the sequels come! [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is a rare successful franchise resurrection; it is an 80s action film with the budget of a modern era film with mind-blowing cinematography|Fresh
... visually the film is astonishing.|Fresh
The action here is fast and furious, and truly out of this world.|Fresh
[Mad Max's] visual intelligence and wit vastly outweigh its concessions to the genre.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is the perfect chick flick for the discerning viewer who prefers her protagonist to be more Ellen Ripley than a musical Charlie's Angel.|Fresh
While the original conceit of the Mad Max universe is maintained, the new film surpasses its origins, and offers up a brand new post-Apocalyptic funhouse ride, with a surprisingly thoughtful subtext.|Fresh
Nothing about this story is tame. It is filled with relentless non-stop action, violence with a hint of humor.|Fresh
Insanely creative. Insanely violent. Insanely satisfying.|Fresh
You need to go see this film. Wins for women in Hollywood are too rare for you not to.|Fresh
George Miller has told a story that feels authentic to the world he's created, but that also takes it in a new and fascinating direction.|Fresh
The chases and wrecks are artfully choreographed, the constant motion tending toward the balletic.|Fresh
I can only say that it's one of the purest pieces of filmmaking virtuosity you'll see anywhere.|Fresh
The memories of the original Mad Max series are intact. This is not more of the same. Fury Road takes you down a different trail.|Fresh
It is a wild, inventive, barking-bonkers trumpet voluntary of Wagnerian proportions, and I loved it. I loved it.|Fresh
Miller has truly knocked this one out of the park. A home run if I've ever seen one, and one that I'm looking forward to experiencing again.|Fresh
looks like oil on a hot engine|Fresh
Like the original Mad Max trilogy, Miller's dystopia is drenched in political commentary, but while the film's feminism has recently taken center stage, its environmentalism is far more strident.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road wasn't the biggest hit film of the summer of 2015 (that honor belongs to Jurassic World) but it is easily the most visceral and the most intelligent action film of year. Decades in the making, there's nothing else like this out there.|Fresh
Miller's commitment to things that look cool cannot be overstated. Mad Max Fury Road is a never-ending stream of such things|Fresh
Those in search of a bludgeoning good time will find it in his new scorched-earth action extravaganza, Mad Max: Fury Road -- it's hard to remember the last time a summer tent-pole movie over-delivered in the ways this does.|Fresh
Yeah, I get it. I admired the film a lot. But did I love it? Well...|Fresh
A machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours.|Fresh
A fun and thrilling film where Miller doesn't take himself too seriously and allows some humor to appear, like the crazy flamethrower guitar player. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Furiosa is] the human touch in this inhumane world and the madly beating heart of this technical wonder of a movie.|Fresh
A wildly monotonous film that operates at one volume - fortissimo - bludgeoning us over the head into either submission or exhaustion.|Rotten
[Audiences] will immediately recognize its undeniable prowess and action-classic qualities that have been missing from the world of cinema for quite some time now.|Fresh
The craziest, most delirious spectacle you're likely to lay eyes on this year.|Fresh
Miller now ranks alongside Gilliam, Lynch, Burton et al as one of cinema's more distinct visionaries thanks to this elseworld of warped, hideous survivors and bizarre contraptions.|Fresh
The inventiveness and chutzpah with which Miller keeps this mad pursuit interesting is remarkable, as is the movie's cinematography, and design.|Fresh
Although Mad Max is not for everyone, those who want a good shake that doesn't put their neurons at stake will fefinitely appreciate it. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road captures the joy and style of what action cinema once was -- a good story with convincing characters supported by the stunning choreography of cinematography, editing and production design.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is the action movie we've forgotten to demand, or perhaps we never knew we could ask for.|Fresh
That argument about how CGI has ruined the popcorn blockbuster is met with maniacal laughter on behalf of Miller and his audacity to stay true to his roots.|Fresh
It's not the masterpiece that people prematurely announced, but it's deffinately one of the best films of 2015. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Richly visual reboot.|Fresh
If George Miller set the bar for modern action films with Mad Max in 1979, with Fury Road he completely obliterates it and creates an entirely new cinematic standard all his own.|Fresh
George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road upends all expectations-about how action sequences are composed, what themes a blockbuster can contain, or who a film's actual protagonist can be-and puts most other filmmakers working on this scale to shame.|Fresh
A insane and surprisingly free proposal. Brutal. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film creates a perfect balance between action and depth of basic needs, in the midst of an infertile atmosphere. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A real visual and narrative hallucination, that does not stop at any time and steals your breath every minute. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The result is a film that combines the crazy style of his predecessors with his own frenetic pace. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Not the masterpiece that more than one critic has ventured prematurely to ponder, however finishes being the blockbuster of the year. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

The real protagonist is an abstract but essential character to the film: the road itself. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A small miracle to have a great time with. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Miller has returned through the front door to reign, without any doubt, among many blockbusters now cooked in Hollywood. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's easy to make a wall-to-wall action movie when you don't care if it looks real or makes narrative sense, and that's the essential difference between so much action today and Fury Road.|Fresh
It all means to be disturbing, magical and original, but that does not stop my mouth to occasionally issue a yawn. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
It's hard to do justice in words to Fury Road's nonstop, breathtaking action sequences.|Fresh
There's an amazing sense of scale and depth to the cinematography by John Seale, who came out of retirement for this one, and also a brilliantly varied color palette.|Fresh
Fury Road, despite its lack of an interesting plot, despite the absence of flesh-and-blood characters, despite the basic sameness of any sequel, still manages to thrill.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road makes you feel the heat of its apocalyptic atmosphere, the rust of the wreckage scraping beneath your fingers and the impossible hope that its characters will rise from the ashes.|Fresh
The title character seems along for the ride in George Miller's very good looking reimagining of the post-apocalyptic fantasy world he first delivered in 1979.|Fresh
It is far more fun than any other action movie in recent memory; and no doubt a sweet vindication for Miller's admirable perseverance.|Fresh
Charlize Theron is really something.|Fresh
Simply bloody amazing, Fury Road is an adrenaline-fuelled, fist-pumping, action masterpiece. You'd be mad to miss it.|Fresh
Miller's trademark absurdist humour pops up ever so often in the middle of the stunningly directed and relentless mayhem.|Fresh
In short, this is a brilliantly orchestrated, riotously entertaining action thriller that demands to be seen on the big screen.|Fresh
A pulse-pounding two hours of pure anarchy.|Fresh
We'll have to wait for the inevitable sequel to find out where it's going. In the meantime, get yourself some earplugs.|Fresh
An extremely entertaining film and one of the best action movies I've seen in years. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Action as art.|Fresh
At 70 years old, director George Miller returns to give a master class in how to make an action film. With rich visuals and a preference for practical effects, Mad Max Fury Road is the best movie of 2015 so far.[Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I hope the franchise continues with Hardy, but I wouldn't mind another franchise that's just Furiosa.|Fresh
An edge-of-your-seat, adrenaline-fueled, high body-count splatterfest that remains riveting from start to finish despite dispensing with the idea of plot development once the premise has been set.|Fresh
The most unexpected great movie of 2015 arrives on home video with a gorgeous transfer that fully honors it's distinctly amazing road-fever aesthetic.|Fresh
The closest Miller (or anyone else for that matter) has come to capturing the sense of wonder, awe and energy that he did with The Road Warrior|Fresh
A relentless two-hour assault both on the eardrums and the eyeballs, Mad Max: Fury Road is the craziest film of the year so far -- and one of the loudest of all time.|Fresh
This is a film daring in both ideas and imagery, a spectacular carnival of carnage that puts most other blockbusters to shame. I'm already gearing myself up for another ride.|Fresh
If you want to see stuff blowing up for two hours straight and don't care about a story or character development, then this is the movie for you. But I need a lot more out of a film.|Rotten
Far from feeling repetitive or even drawn out, Fury Road grips like a vice throughout.|Fresh
It's an authentic Mad Max movie without being slavishly bound to the past -- a radical notion that's so crazy it just works.|Fresh
"You can almost feel the air whipping around your head and there's an impressive lack of CGI but as an action spectacle the picture has few genuine ""wow"" moments, favouring constant motion over stand-out sequences."|Fresh
The film's dusty, cobbled-together props and costumes are drawn straight from The Road Warrior. Fury Road drops the '80s big hair and headbands, but overall, it's amazing how well the aesthetic has held up.|Fresh
As a car chase movie, though, this thing is the bomb.|Fresh
Amid a masterful, epic symphony of truly insane stuntwork, Miller establishes Fury Road as something much greater than the average blockbuster.|Fresh
If you're a hardcore computer gamer inured to marathon sessions of annihilation while being pulverised by Death Metal from wall-to-wall speaker stacks, this may be the movie for you. For myself, not so much.|Rotten
Hope is also what makes Fury Road go. For all the cruelty and destruction in its many monsters' hearts, the movie is a paean to hope.|Fresh
Miller throws everything at the screen in balletic, joyous conflagrations that, while long and in some ways repetitious, never get boring.|Fresh
Not one frame of this movie is wasted. It feels as if every moment is loaded with conflict: Visually stunning, aurally pleasing, impactful conflict.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road delivers all the stylish and dusty mayhem I could handle for two fast and furious hours.|Fresh
Max himself and some of the villains may be thinly sketched, but Fury Road is definitely worth the cost of gasoline to go and see.|Fresh
[Miller's] uncompromising, yet resolutely accessible vision melts down and re-forges the template all of his contemporaries in the action field will have to work with from now on.|Fresh
Mad Max creator George Miller brings the futuristic franchise thundering back to life, a lot less lean but just as mean, more than three decades after Mel Gibson donned the leathers.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road will be a delight to anyone looking for nothing more than an adrenaline-fueled, action-packed thrill ride, but for those expecting a little more thought put into the story and characters, it will be something of a slight disappointment.|Rotten
Mad Max: Fury Road is the unfettered fever dream of a true auteur, captured on the big screen (and on marvelous Blu-Ray) at its most powerful, and it's even better than you could have imagined.|Fresh
Para saber como seria um filme que tomou cido e cheirou cocana, basta assistir a Mad Max: Estrada da Fria.|Fresh
Fury Road is an experience for the senses, bursting with colour, car chases and downright ridiculous armoury.|Fresh
Despite all the flaming twisted metal and heavy riffing, Fury Road's most explosive element might be its keenly subversive heart.|Fresh
Jaw-droppingly beautiful when it isn't horrifyingly ugly, this is a literal vision of hell-on-wheels and features some of the most astonishing action ever committed to film.|Fresh
The endless action of the film's third act ensures that Mad Max: Fury Road concludes on a decidedly underwhelming note...|Rotten
The freakiness elevates the film.|Fresh
Pedal-to-the-medal kick ass action drives this summer winner to the max. If there is any justice Charlize Theron will get an Oscar nomination. And so will the movie.|Fresh
This is what fast and furious really looks like.|Fresh
Feminist? Absolutely. Detrimental to the film? Not in the slightest...it's a movie of heavy metal imagination and bone-grinding engineering. Motorheads rejoice!|Fresh
Unlike action directors of the plodding sort, George Miller doesn't ask you to understand the deliriously strange world into which he throws you headlong. He just wants to change the parts you recognize.|Fresh
"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is everything you want your summer blockbuster to be: loaded with insane action, hot actors and death-defying stunts."|Fresh
Masterfully kinetic and often downright berserk.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is a relentless marvel of sense-pummeling stunts and gargoyle horror that needs to take a breather once in a while.|Fresh
An action packed, artistic, and emotional piece of apocalyptic cinema that I enjoyed greatly...|Fresh
It's bursting with imagination, wit, enough real-world stunts to create a sense of high stakes, and performances that register with real emotion in the midst of absurdity.|Fresh
Hope is a mistake. But this represents a certain kind of hope that's contagious. As technology continues to improve and digital effects persist, it's refreshing to see an old-school master get back to basics - and use his powers for good.|Fresh
Fury Road has visionary moments, speed and a wild sense of daring|Fresh
"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one long adrenaline pump of a chase scene."|Fresh
You stumble out of the theatre giddy about what films can do, transported by the breathtaking velocity in this battering ram of a picture that just goes, goes, goes and then keeps on going.|Fresh
The action is fast and furious and totally bonkers. And yet the style is totally original: Old West showdowns meets funk mayhem meets feminist drama. Seriously.|Fresh
...has a lot more to do with the architecture of the frame and Miller's delight in throwing things right at the face of the audience than any sneaky feminism. There's a kind of kinetic genius to the movie, which is essentially one long chase.|Fresh
Thunderously entertaining re-boot --a relentless action movie that avoids clutter while maintaining a visual ferocity and taking time for a few heartwarming detours.|Fresh
I defy you to see a better film this year.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road possesses the most elusive of cinematic virtues: it fits no mold other than its own.|Fresh
[VIDEO ESSAY] Instant cult-classic? You bet.|Fresh
The movie is one long-running battle scene expertly staged and paced by Miller, with a judicious use of CGI that doesn't insult us with the blatantly impossible.|Fresh
For all its action and spectacle, Mad Max: Fury Road represents a sort of creative idealism that critics and cinephiles swoon for.|Fresh
An amazing piece of genre filmmaking, and, frankly speaking, 90% of the Hollywood action film community just got schooled by a 70-year-old veteran.|Fresh
"""Fury Road"" is a movie in which action speaks louder than words. Miller and his production team fill the screen with a wide variety of amazing and impressive stunts, which will have you gaping in disbelief, while holding the dialogue to a minimum."|Fresh
It is fair to say that Fury Road will raise audience expectations to the degree that every producer and studio chief with an action flick tentpole scheduled for this summer will soon be reaching for the painkiller of his or her choice.|Fresh
an all-out rush of visceral, kinetic power and-yes-fury that mixes the old and the new in ways that are both dazzling and exhausting|Fresh
A blazing descent into a desert hellscape. Revs on and on as a spectacle best seen on the big screen in all its crazy-as-a-desert-fox, carefully car-choreographed glory. One leering, gibbering, riotous romp of an action-extravaganza.|Fresh
Everything you need to know about the situations and characters is vibrantly depicted on screen. This isn't a film for people who want everything revealed through dialogue.|Fresh
Lots of fire in this one.|Fresh
When it comes to foot-down, hell-for-leather exhilaration, Mad Max: Fury Road makes the Fast & Furious franchise resemble a spin in a Reliant Robin.|Fresh
A film of visionary grandeur.|Fresh
To think that this furious, fuming, freaky world should have been created by a man in his 70s, the same guy who warmed the cockles of our heart with Happy Feet and Babe, is unbelievable.|Fresh
A visceral feminist anthem disguised as a post-apocalyptic car chase.|Fresh
"A precipitous decline from ""Beyond Thunderdome""."|Rotten
Everything we desire in a summer popcorn movie, and more.|Fresh
It seems the only people who make them like they used to are the ones that made the originals.|Fresh
A spectacular demolition derby of action that totally overwhelms every other aspect of the film: characters, narrative, emotion and charm flattened in the dust.|Fresh
Fury Road is all technique but sometimes you want more or in this case, maybe less.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is one hell of an achievement; 'hell' being the operative word, given how long director George Miller spent toiling to develop the damned thing.|Fresh
A revved-up vision of gloriously twisted design, propulsive momentum and resonant mythmaking.|Fresh
I was lost in the relentless imagination of this thing, which baits us with the purest of popcorn fodder, yet smashes the ceiling of the Bechdel Test with a righteous feminist roar.|Fresh
one can look at any quarter of the screen and see more action and more amusing detail than is in any three other action films this summer|Fresh
This is not your father's Mad Max.|Fresh
While it isn't likely to change your idea of cinema (at least I hope not), isn't worth the hype and has its share of problems, this is one wild ride that's worth taking.|Fresh
Neither a remake or reboot, but rather a refuel of glorious Nitrous that not only has this long gestating franchise supercharged, but also firing on all cylinders|Fresh
I was already getting excited for my second viewing ten minutes into my first ... it's got the weird vernacular, the Australian-ness .... It may have cost hundreds of millions of dollars, but still feels home-grown, hand-made, and completely deviant.|Fresh
If you strap yourself in and let yourself just go along for the ride, you might just get your mind blown.|Fresh
Excellent movie. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...makes a stark statement: If this is humanity, then it's no wonder the world was destroyed. Most of these maniacs would blow it up again tomorrow.|Fresh
The film lacks the granular realism of the earlier installments, but Miller renders that unnecessary by magnifying the weirdness and insanity that always lurked beneath the series' surface.|Fresh
Ferocious and irresistible, Mad Max: Fury Road is a modern masterpiece that could redefine the action standard.|Fresh
It's fine B-grade mulch, but it's certainly no masterpiece...it's surprising, and a tad disheartening, how readily Fury Road falls into line with so many other production-line blockbusters.|Fresh
A mesmerizing ride of non-stop action and imaginative weirdness from beginning to end. It also has more than just action. There are interesting characters and some glimpses into an amazing desert society.|Fresh
Fury Road is a defiantly individual riposte to those committee-led blockbusters which are built on CGI and designed to sell toys.|Fresh
The action movie of the summer.|Fresh
Headlong, berserk, bonkers, bat----, boisterous, bountiful and big-hearted... George Miller in three sentences: We're doomed. Keep moving. Be kind.|Fresh
An electric monster of an action film!|Fresh
A more peripatetic, high octane, testosterone-fueled chase film you will rarely see.|Fresh
The best action movie since - if I'm trying really hard to be conservative - Hard Boiled in 1992.|Fresh
An orgy of loud and louder, leaving us alternately exhilarated, exasperated and exhausted.|Fresh
Miller begins with a well-choreographed chase sequence that never really stops. Except for a handful of very short detours, this is two hours of unrelenting warfare.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is a glorious symphony of violence, action, and subversive wit and wisdom that goes far beyond anything its series' predecessors or any recent action film has done.|Fresh
Boring plot, impressive but depressing production - a boys - toys movie|Fresh
Buckle up tight, moviegoers - Mad Max: Fury Road is one hell of a ride.|Fresh
"So wonderful to behold and packed with glorious action that by the end there was a grand total of 12 words in my trusty reviewer's notebook. And two of them were ""holy sh*t."""|Fresh
Fast and furious, this revolutionary Road is a solid two hours of maximum overdrive.|Fresh
An astonishing full-throttle action movie that proves Miller may have taught those other directors everything they know - but he didn't teach them everything he knows.|Fresh
... a furious, insanely entertaining post-apocalyptic road picture ... Miller, who just turned 70, puts on a clinic for aspiring action directors young enough to be his grandchildren.|Fresh
In Fury Road there is nothing pacifist or even docile in Miller's conception of the nature of the feminine, no matter what they look like or what they are wearing.|Fresh
It turns out we do need another hero, and it comes in the guise of George Miller.|Fresh
If you're up for the ride you'll be rewarded with the most senses- and (common) sense-shattering action spectacle in decades.|Fresh
Plot, dialogue, intelligence, subtlety, suspense, wit, chemistry and logic get tossed out the window in George Miller's fourth milking of this franchise.|Rotten
A hyper-accelerated rush of towering, weird-ass oil-fisted heavy metal explosiveness.|Fresh
"Holy crap ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" rocks! Oh what a lovely day indeed!"|Fresh
Makes most other blockbusters, superhero sagas and special-effect blowouts look like they were made with doodles, doodads and trinkets from a toy box.|Fresh
"The audience feels transported to this post-apocalyptic setting, and the mind-blowing action sequences rival any that have ever been put to film. George Miller does a magnificent job in recapturing the feel of his beloved ""Mad Max"" franchise."|Fresh
Stripped of such frivolities as plot and character development, Fury Road is two hours of rolling thunder that will leave your inner 12-year-old giggling with glee.|Fresh
The epitome of a badass thrill ride and what a reboot should really be, I'll patiently wait another 30 years for someone to achieve what George Miller has pulled off here.|Fresh
A gorgeous, scrap-metal demolition derby of a popcorn picture.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully strange, violent and thrilling cinematic composition that proves George Miller is a more brilliant maestro than ever.|Fresh
Director George Miller wastes enough bombs and ammunition to win a small war but it's in a winning cause. This is a lot of fun and pure guilty post-apocalyptic pleasure.|Fresh
I wanted get my socks knocked off but they were still on my feet as I left the theater.|Fresh
Like Jurassic Park, The Dark Knight, and, yes, The Road Warrior before it, Mad Max: Fury Road sets a new gold standard for action cinema.|Fresh
"For anyone who denied that Titus Andronicus could ever be mashed up with The Cannonball Run, here is your answer, and we are only too happy to follow Nux as he cries, ""What a lovely day!,"" and accelerates into a whirlwind of fire."|Fresh
The practical effects and stunts give it the kind of bone-jarring, visceral impact that most Hollywood and Marvel superhero movies have largely abandoned. By comparison, The Avengers: Age Of Ultron, seems unconvincingly cartoonish.|Fresh
The time that Mad Max: Fury Road took in the oven was to demonstrate that the legendary character has much to deliver and get excited for. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Furiously on-target for action junkies and fan-boys...|Fresh
A mindless, expensive B-movie that's more exhausting, tedious and nauseating than exhilarating.|Rotten
Fury Road is also one of the best action movies of the decade, a punk Last Judgment with manic invention and depraved wit on display in every frame.|Fresh
Try naming a modern blockbuster that has as much chutzpah as Mad Max: Fury Road. You can't, because there isn't one. This is what happens when you lay out all your crazy on the screen at once: glorious, crackling entertainment.|Fresh
Miller has the dubious distinction of essentially creating the post-apocalyptic action genre, and in this film, set some 40 years after the fall of the world, he outdoes himself.|Fresh
Grim yet exhilarating, it may be one of the more powerful movies this year.|Fresh
If you want your big screen thrill ride this summer, this might just be the ticket.|Fresh
Almost unprecedented in the history of movies- a reboot from the 30 director 30 years later that's an absolute triumph of kinetic action.|Fresh
Mad Max is Back. George Miller is an action-movie genius. See it in 2D!|Fresh
"The incredible array of physical objects moving through space in unique ways makes it seem limitlessly inventive, in a way that's far more artistic than the basic button-pushing of something like ""Furious 7."""|Fresh
In the 1979 'Mad Max,' a makeup-effects insert shot shows the doomed Toecutter's eyes bulging impossibly from his head in the instant before he collides with a truck; I felt similarly bug-eyed as I tried to take in the awesome spectacle of 'Fury Road.'|Fresh
Tom Hardy is mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore. Well, OK, maybe one more time in George Miller's furious adrenaline pill that's true to the movie's kick-ass roots.|Fresh
Writer/Director George Miller set the GPS, aligned the steering wheel and then unrelentingly stepped on the gas, never once stopping or slowing down to second guess himself.|Fresh
Thirty years after his hero walked off into a nuclear sunset, George Miller returns for more than just a greatest-hits package, orchestrating a go-for-broke action symphony that's also wonderfully, wildly subversive.|Fresh
Unrestrained and uncompromising, this hugely enjoyable blockbuster provides a mad and memorable ride. More please!|Fresh
Awesome! Up-ends the genre. No dialogue, no exposition, no explanation and no kissing. Just pure energy (and heroic stunt work)!|Fresh
A speed-metal classic.|Fresh
One over-the-top, bombastic, adrenaline-filled chase scene. Love it or leave it.|Fresh
Miller's ferocious, grotesque, beautiful film is every bit the equal of its original trilogy from the '80s, and throws down the gauntlet for every action film made since.|Fresh
It makes sense a MAD MAX army goes into battle with a metal guitarist. This primal, epic film is the stuff of Homer in the key of Metallica.|Fresh
An unapologetic action film that shows how magnificent chase scenes can be when put in the hands of a gifted director and a cast that realizes that in a post-apocalyptic world, less really is more.|Fresh
70-year-old George Miller steps before this cinematic cult, shows the skill set he's developed over the last three-plus decades, and then drops the mic.|Fresh
A double-barrelled shotgun enema straight to the senses, George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is an exercise in relentless, pedal-to-the-metal momentum that can only qualify as savagely pleasurable.|Fresh
There's no great meaning here - it's a basic story of rebellion and redemption. But there's such energy and visual invention in a world so fully realized and dazzling that the roller coaster ride is more than enough on its own.|Fresh
This summer's blockbuster offerings may be setting box office records, yet seem like holograms when compared with this weighty offering.|Fresh

There's never been anything like Mad Max: Fury Road, a film as revolutionary as it is entertaining.|Fresh
This is how an action movie should be: gutsy, unapologetic, relentless, artful, well-written, full-throttle and, above all, spectacular. Destined to be an Australian classic.|Fresh
George Miller has taken trash, literally and figuratively, and transformed it into a kinetic art sculpture traveling through the Namib at 200 kilometers per hour, complete with its own roving orchestra...|Fresh
"It's got the action and explosions of a ""Transformers"" movie, but makes those films look like complex dramas in comparison."|Fresh
Even the wondrously choreographed stunting that keeps everything flying, flipping, careening, and cartwheeling in every direction starts to look like some demented Cirque de Soleil performance with a demolition derby theme after a while.|Rotten
It's the cinematic ride of the year.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is a thrill ride for the ages. This is a great pulpy B-movie infused with A-list talent and the bountiful studio budget to boot.|Fresh
One of the most harrowing, intense, thrilling action movies of all time. It is absolutely epic.|Fresh
Miller has made all of these younger filmmakers seem like dinosaurs. The fourth film in the series is head and shoulders above other modern action films.|Fresh
That master of apocalyptic junkyard anarchy is back, bigger, wilder, madder than ever.|Fresh

This incredible cinematic masterpiece takes you on a high-octane acid trip that gloriously assaults your senses... probably one the best action movies you'll ever see.|Fresh
Two hours of action scenes that are well crafted and entirely lacking in suspense, and with some clever but fake-looking special effects.|Rotten
It goes to show that, even in a lovingly detailed post-apocalyptic milieu of de-evolution, a filmmaker can still evolve.|Fresh
There's enough horror remixed here -- of the Heart of Darkness version -- to engage our current moment. That should be one of the obligations of a reboot.|Fresh
Fury Road ignites this overwhelming sensation of chill inducing satisfaction and an unquenchable thirst that can only be satiated by repeat viewings of a visually stunning and unconventionally magnificent technological achievement in filmmaking.|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road provokes the same question from its audience again and again: What can you show me next? The answer is always the same: Something even more outlandish and imaginative than what you just saw.|Fresh
Avant-garde action cinema on an enormous scale that manages to be utterly original and suffused with a rebellion against patriarchy that is thrilling to watch in this form.|Fresh
Movement, images, and some plucky actors carry all the emotion and humor a movie of this scale needs, and its kinetic force delivers an adrenaline boost to your system.|Fresh
A mind-boggling exercise in pure action Mad Max: Fury Road is overwhelming, achieving the sort of visual poetry typically ascribed to Ben-Hur's chariot race or one of Sam Peckinpah's blood ballets.|Fresh
A kinetic, hallucinatory, boldly feminist chase flick that, with its vibrant color palette, harrowing stunt work and show-don't-tell style of yarn-spinning, leaves every Marvel movie and every Fast & Furious in its irradiated dust.|Fresh
It's a pitiless, primitive, primal world [Miller's] built - from its medicine to its religion to its tribal diplomacy - and it's wondrous to behold.|Fresh
"The ""Mad Max"" franchise was never for everyone, yet it clearly benefits from fresh blood, too. Propelled by Miller's nitro-burning aesthetic vision and an entertaining cast, this turbo-charged new model is a gas, gas, gas."|Fresh
A gleefully violent -- and improbably feminist -- phantasmagoria that turns epic road rage and long stretches of vehicular omnicide into an eye-boggling joy ride.|Fresh
Miller ... dreamed the mighty dream that is this film for more than a decade before being able to bring it to life. It has been worth the wait.|Fresh
Miller has found his heavy metal groove (one of the legion of freaky baddies is strapped to the front of a truck, grinding out a sonic burn of electric guitar licks for the entire movie).|Fresh
"*This* is how you reboot a franchise. But as good an apocalyptic actioner as ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is, ""The Road Warrior"" is still the gold standard."|Fresh

The fourth installment of Miller's Mad Max films is not to be missed. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As efficient an exercise in pure action and visceral excitement as today's jaded audiences could ask for, though little more than that.|Fresh
It's action with a purpose - Miller's potent opera of movement becomes a rolling horror-satire of mankind's greed, foolish short-termism and endless penchant for self-destruction.|Fresh
Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is a hammer-down, cast-iron-plated, diesel-exhaust-belching manifesto on the physics of screen action, a metamechanics monster truck show with everything but a Robosaurus.|Fresh
Real people and organic settings always capture the eye more fully, and imply higher stakes, than CGI imagery. Miller ups the ante by ensuring all characters and vehicles are visually striking, either in their good looks or their hideousness.|Fresh
Unstoppable and righteous, it roars across the no-lane hardpan like the four-iron horseman of the kinetic apocalypse, amped up on bathtub crank and undiluted movie love. Oh, what a movie. What a lovely movie!|Fresh
2015 belongs to Max!|Fresh
To paraphrase James Ellroy, Fury Road rules, all other summer blockbusters drool.|Fresh
I don't mean to go full-tilt cinema geek here, but Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road resonates with classic epics from the distant past.|Fresh
Miller remains a supreme master of action. With his splendid tech cohorts, the action here is immersive and high impact; it has a nasty, believable edge. It plays well, real... when characters are close to die, we feel it.|Fresh
A pedal to the metal cinematic excursion unrivaled by most any action flick -- especially in the car chase action sub genre -- of the past decade. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)|Fresh
A new entry in the Mad Max franchise every bit as unique as the first three, Mad Max: Fury Road is a welcome, exciting and surprising addition to the post-apocalyptic blockbuster genre.|Fresh
Miller shoots the mayhem with a clear, steady eye, plus a fair amount of cheeky humour.|Fresh
Fury Road is a two-hour car chase, but strapped to the hood (much like Max himself in the early scenes) is a simple, satisfying story.|Fresh
This new 'Mad Max,' reimagined with considerable inspiration and a wicked production design, is a furiously good action film.|Fresh
Fury Road is a feast of explosions, fights and crashes that come at break-neck speed... The worst thing about the movie moving at such a rapid pace is that there is little time to appreciate the craftsmanship that went into the modified rides.|Fresh
An operatic extravaganza of thrilling action and nearly non-stop mayhem ... exhilarating, deranged and exhausting in almost equal measures.|Fresh
This is entertainment to the maddest max. Every inner 12-year-old will think he -- or perhaps even she -- has died and gone to a heaven that looks just like hell.|Fresh
Tom Hardy is perfectly cast as the leather-sporting, crazy-eyed Road Warrior, but the reason why Mad Max: Fury Road feels so right is simple: It's Miller's world, and he's taking us back.|Fresh
Miller, whose 1979 picture of the same name was the first worldwide hit in the Australian film revival of the '70s, has topped himself with a version that has maybe half the emotion but twice the visual impact.|Fresh
You leave the theater still shaking, everything still pumping and throbbing, a treadmill stopping on a dime and sending you careening through the back wall.|Fresh
Hardy and Theron make a dynamite team, but Theron is the film's bruised heart and soul. So get prepped for a new action classic. You won't know what hit you.|Fresh

This is analog filmmaking at its most daring.|Fresh
Varoom, varoom!|Fresh

It's enormous, destructive, and largely indescribable. It's also a gleefully barnstorming actioner that's going to be difficult to top this year.|Fresh

There will never be another movie like Mad Max: Fury Road. Period.|Fresh

"The first ""Mad Max"" movie in 30 years doesn't disappoint -- it's a sonic-speed juggernaut of violence and destruction."|Fresh
"It is insane. In a good way. Whoever said ""Too much is never enough"" made an impression on Miller, who uses the phrase as a starting point and blasts off from there."|Fresh
Mad Max: Fury Road is what so many films strive for and so few achieve - an experience that feels somewhat unique in what it accomplishes.|Fresh
George Miller has managed to make Mad Max smarter and more sophisticated without losing the series' panache or f*ck you charm. Rather than repeat himself, he articulates, and it's wonderful.|Fresh

Fury Road keeps producing one astonishing image after another, and it uses these images to construct action scenes edited with a dancer's sense of rhythm.|Fresh

In all, a terrific experience.|Fresh
This is the post-apocalyptic movie to end all post-apocalyptic movies. There is even more dust, rust and decay here than in the original films. The credits themselves are in molten red lettering.|Fresh

Assaulting and intense, delivering an outrageously relentless adrenaline rush...|Fresh
Fury Road not only captures the same Molotov-cocktail craziness of Miller's masterpiece, 1981's The Road Warrior-it's also a surprisingly hypercaffeinated film for a director in his fifth decade behind the camera.|Fresh
[F]aster, bigger, badder, & better than anything else you'll see on screen in 2015. An awe-inspiring display of action storytelling... [and] insanely uncompromising brilliance...|Fresh

"""A supercharged spectacle that races through the gears delivering shot after shot of gasoline-laced adrenaline direct to the heart."""|Fresh
An edge-of-your-seat, adrenaline-fueled, high body-count splatterfest that remains riveting from start to finish despite dispensing with the idea of plot development once the premise has been set.|Fresh
In the same way that the original 1979 Mad Max was the Citizen Kane of gut-bucket Australian exploitation cinema, Mad Max: Fury Road may well be the Gtterdmmerung of drive-in movies.|Fresh
In the battle of the 2015 behemoths, the maxed-out madness of Mad Max: Fury Road sets an extraordinarily high bar - then pole-vaults clean over it and smashes the entire rig to smithereens.|Fresh
"""Light on plot"" would be a fair description. But so would ""streamlined"" - a rare property in a summer movie, and by no means one to hold against it."|Fresh

"Thirty years have passed since our last visit to George Miller's sun-scorched post-apocalyptic wasteland, and yet ""worth the wait"" still seems a puny response to the two hours of ferocious, unfettered B-movie bliss offered by ""Mad Max: Fury Road."""|Fresh
This madly entertaining new action extravaganza energetically kicks more ass, as well as all other parts of the anatomy, than any film ever made by a 70-year-old - and does so far more skillfully than those turned out by most young turks half his age.|Fresh
Extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over the top, George Miller has revived his Mad Max punk-western franchise as a bizarre convoy chase action-thriller in the post-apocalyptic desert.|Fresh

Mad Max: Fury Road is a remarkable and glorious motion picture, not just one of the great action movies of our time but also a great film, period.|Fresh
