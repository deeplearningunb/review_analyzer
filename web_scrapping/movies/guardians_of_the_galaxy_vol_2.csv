Women of color are either sexual objects or played off for laughs. Mantis, found by Ego and raised as his servant and 'pet', seems to be written explicitly for the film to indulge in submissive Asian stereotypes.|Rotten
Yes, in many ways Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is more of the same. And one could argue that we're dealing with some diminishing returns. That's OK; it's still fun.|Fresh
All in all, for someone notoriously wary of contemporary superhero franchises, I came out the hall a relatively unoffended viewer. Gunn's style just about supersedes the zip-zap-zoom, space-heavy heritage of the comic material he adapts.|Fresh
It still has its wacky off-beat humour, but this time the last third came with an emotional punch, and made you like them all a lot more as they grew closer.|Fresh
It's a very different movie from the first, but it still hits all the same high notes.|Fresh
You will leave the cinema richly satisfied, even if it isn't quite the film you're expecting.|Fresh
It's a movie about people talking, and caring for one another - filling each other's respective emotional void - just as much as it is about laser guns and punching.|Fresh
Vol. 2 feels less like a sequel made to surpass its predecessor, and more like a continuation of a story. Much like a comic from your childhood, you know you can pick it up, continue with beloved characters, and escape into a world you are familiar with.|Fresh

The Guardians series continues well here in Vol. 2, giving viewers more of what they expect in the unexpected.|Fresh
Don't get me wrong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is still a fun party-but it's the kind that doesn't know when to end.|Fresh
These are great characters, impeccably well cast, under the supervision of a genuine auteur talent inhabiting easily the most unique and bizarre status-quo in the modern blockbuster scene.|Fresh
Doesn't quite live up to its predecessor, but it's still enjoyable thanks to a cast with great chemistry. It's a group that seems to be having a lot of fun together, and that fun on screen proves to be contagious.|Fresh
As watchable as a Baby Groot dancing GIF, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 merrily continues the saga of its lovable band of space rascals.|Fresh
Like the array of beloved '70s and '80s tunes peppered throughout the soundtrack, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a welcome mix of the fresh and the familiar that does the job of priming the pump for another volume.|Fresh
What it perhaps lacks in originality and focus is a result of a slight adjustment in priorities, and instead delivers a touching and intimate story about the nature of family.|Fresh
James Gunn has pulled us in closer to this team of A-holes in an absolutely entertaining sequel that stands as one of Marvel's finest.|Fresh
A brilliant spectacle in more ways than one, serving to both amp up the first film's chaotic-good energy and delve deeper into its characters|Fresh
"Beyond Groot, ""Guardians 2"" is a satisfying sequel to 2014's breakout hit full of '80s pop culture references to Pac-Man, Knight Rider, ""Cheers,"" and even David Hasselhoff."|Fresh
It is a fun, enjoyable work of science fiction fantasy. Fans of these genres will undoubtably find things to enjoy with this film.|Fresh
Offers creative action, a deep story, gorgeously colorful visuals, and enough characters to grow and love.|Fresh
Despite the film's bloated structure, and its tendency to sway and get distracted now and then, Gunn still manages to pack an emotional punch in the end, delivering a character send-off that's bound to bring most viewers to the verge of tears.|Fresh
While it may not have the novelty of its predecessor, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is hilarious, brimming with pathos, and real pretty to boot.|Fresh
"Like the first film, ""Vol. 2"" is colorful and full of wit and action."|Fresh
They kept what worked in the first volume - the music and the humor - and expanded upon it.|Fresh
The team needs a little bit of work, but the general character development, action, and gorgeous visuals make up for that. And obviously, so does Baby Groot.|Fresh
This is drippy family therapy that wants you to bask in the characters' personal breakthroughs after you're done dissing them behind their backs.|Rotten
For better and for worse, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is average. And yet, to my great indignation, it still managed to move me to laughter and a few tears.|Fresh
More of the same, and yet a case of diminishing returns.|Rotten
I'll say it: I liked it better than the first one.|Fresh
Guardians of The Galaxy 2 as a body of art/work can be added to the list of movies that makes it hard to say the sequels aren't as good or better than the first movie.|Fresh
The film overall is both a visual treat and surprisingly thoughtful adventure. It's about accepting your friends for who they really are and forming family where you find it.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is a refreshing superhero movie. It takes the spotlight and aims it squarely at its characters.|Fresh
James Gunn offers a very promising perspective in the characters' development. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Dave Batista as] Drax is amazing in this movie. I liked him in the first movie, but I loved him in this movie.|Fresh
It's still a fun popcorn ride, but not much more.|Fresh
Vol. 2 is a fun diversion, and as such it mostly succeeds, even though it's not much more than a placeholder for whatever happens in the next one.|Fresh
I enjoyed the humor when it landed, but the build-up was choppy, and the execution as a whole was choppy. The movie felt rushed.|Rotten
I had so much fun watching this movie. From beginning to end I had a freaking blast.|Fresh
Dialogue is just as crisp, the visual look of the film and CGI effects are just as eye-popping, and the characters' personalities may shine even more brightly in this sequel.|Fresh
There's more inventiveness, and more honest to goodness heart in this film than the last four MCU films combined. And the soundtrack isn't too bad, either.|Fresh
Vol. 2 might just be the most fun to be found in a movie theater thus far this year. It's a great sign that there's plenty of inventive life left to be found in the saturated superhero genre.|Fresh
In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is just what it promised to be. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
But most importantly, like its predecessor, this film is fully aware of itself and its objectives - take you on a jaunty adventure and make you laugh in the process|Fresh
... fans should get their money's worth with an assortment of jokes, special effects and lots of Baby Groot. And silly love songs.|Fresh
It sets itself apart from the Captain America and Iron Man movies with its colorful language and its insistence on not taking itself too seriously, which goes a long way.|Fresh
James Gunn has written and directed the two best films in the entire MCU thus far; his work continues to contain superb irreverent humor, boast visually and emotionally captivating spectacles, and embraces being different|Fresh
The irreverence of the original we can say remains intact, but the punch is not the same. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Guardians of the Galaxy have returned in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, a sequel that provides just as much action and fun as the first movie.|Fresh
So just when the familial schmaltz threatens to overwhelm proceedings, there's always a dated pop reference or scatological gag to leaven the mood.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is obviously a hell of a good time.|Fresh
At times, there's a bit too much going on, and it starts to feel like maybe we're just being set up for Vol. 3. But so what if we are? Fun is the name of the game here, and Vol. 2 has it in spades|Fresh
Though it doesn't come tumbling off the too-high pedestal it built, it does noticeably lose its balance. It's more about managing unreasonable expectations.|Fresh
Needless to say, it's an absolutely essential and thoroughly enjoyable spectacle to watch!|Fresh
Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 builds on the franchise with everything that makes this Marvel offering unique. But most of all it's the music that works wonders here.|Fresh
A beautiful, cosmic symphony. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Enjoyable but half the measure of the original|Fresh
Russell and Pratt are beautifully cast - peas from the same laid-back, wisecracking, vaguely-surfer-dude pod, albeit peas a generation apart.|Fresh
The neon color palette, the classic rock soundtrack, cuts to Drax and Mantis being funny-all of this works to keep Vol. 2 from feeling heavy or overburdened.|Fresh
Vol. 2 is no less idiosyncratic, but it doesn't feel as fresh.|Fresh
This sequel doesn't break new ground, but it still possesses much of the original's energy, fun and heart.|Fresh
... glides right along in its galactic groove. Just move with it.|Fresh
No matter how ugly it gets out there in space for our heroes, Groot is there to make it all better. And, thankfully, he does.|Fresh
What makes Vol. 2 truly awesome is Gunn's willingness to indulge in the whimsy and wonder of the dazzling color of comic book frames.|Fresh
Reaches quite a high bar in terms of grandiose design in eye-searing bright colors.|Fresh
Gunn provides enough explosions to satisfy action-hungry audiences, and after a third-act dip, the movie picks up for an ending that tempers the obligatory mayhem with a bit of emotion.|Fresh
If you enjoyed the first Guardians, you'll love the second, even if the shiny veneer of newness has somewhat dulled.|Fresh
The film is still loaded with strong special effects and a must-have soundtrack. This makes the sequel good but lacks the element of surprise that made the original film so much fun.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 brings Marvel's greatest franchise back with a bang, delivering more of the extraordinarily fun characters, astounding action, and fantastic humor that made the original work so marvelously.|Fresh
Even as Vol. 2 proves to be overlong and needlessly complex, with a last act that doesn't merely drive the point home so much as hold you hostage to it, the movie proves endearing.|Fresh
For most of its running time Vol. 2 feels low stakes, but boy is that a welcome change.|Fresh
An oftentimes fun film of happy nostalgia that actually acknowledges the sleight of hand in its more serious scenes, then reverts back to the happy as a way to cope.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as entertaining as other Marvel movies, but not the best of them. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A marginal improvement over its lackluster predecessor...|Fresh
The entertainment overcomes any failure and continues to raise the standard of what superhero movies are, something that at this point is a common achievement of Marvel. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This new film is plenty entertaining, but lacks the complexity of its predecessor. For a movie that's about growth and relationships, it still feels like this sequel has a bit of growing up to do.|Rotten
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 reveals an inherent flaw in the Marvel universe-building blueprint. Getting to know these sleeper-hit misfits is much more fun than revisiting them.|Fresh
The film needs more id and less Ego: Nothing that appears shocking, reckless or impulsive is allowed to disrupt the strategic, storyboarded faux chaos of the project's blockbuster imperative and 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' orthodoxy.|Fresh
I was intrigued by various clever action set pieces. The film's visual design is often stunning, somewhere in a fantastical realm between Dr. Seuss and Yellow Submarine.|Fresh
The story isn't as strong this time around but these characters have won me over with their charm and spirit.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 also serves as a reminder of why it is we keep coming back to these movies, even as we know every single time that the heroes will prevail and the world will not end: it's the characters, stupid.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 is just like your standard mixtape; it's an uneven experience filled with highs and lows.|Fresh
It's as wild and wildly funny as the original.|Fresh
This is how you keep sequels fresh and the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs to take especial notice.|Fresh
"The film, like its likeable heroes, struggles to find its own sense of significance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and its titular saved ""galaxy"" is left with little gravity or sense of place."|Rotten
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is nearly everything you would have wanted from a Marvel franchise sequel.|Fresh
The film is quite entertaining but becomes absurd because of the attitude of its characters making them unidimensional and causing the audience to lose interest in their conflicts. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
It gives us what we expect: many jokes, space action sequences and a very dynamic plot. This is a hilarious film, but it's much more than just that. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
﻿Outdated pop culture gives Guardians its master joke, as well as its carefully judged position among other special-effects blockbusters.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a slapdash extravaganza careening though bluster and banality.|Rotten
A sequel that has charm and uproarious laughs but doesn't seem at all interested in doing much else with the personalities it assembles.|Fresh
The casting of Russell is pure genius.|Fresh
This sequel to the very successful introduction of the Guardians of the Galaxy gives us more of the same fun - dazzling CGI, funny one-liners and a simply adorable Groot.|Fresh
A simple but efficient film that knows how to take advantage of its clichés to give depth to the crazy cosmic universe of Marvel. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"James Gunn has done something few before him have managed: He's followed a great film with an even greater sequel. Hats off, Cheap Trick's ""Surrender"" on."|Fresh
I found the plot not as tight as the first film, and the humor and sentimentality seemed a bit forced this time around. The internal logic of the plot is a bit loose, too. What carries the film are the characters, and the way they interact.|Fresh
The images fit intelligently with the music selection and the roguish mood makes the film even better. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Overall Guardians Vol. 2 is a worthy entry in this franchise and in Marvel's cinematic orbit.|Fresh
There is certainly plenty of fun to be had with James Gunn's new entry in the Guardians universe, and I will look forward to more adventures with this group...but Volume 2 didn't quite hit the right note for me.|Rotten
All in all, it's a helluva fun ride and the platonic ideal of a Saturday afternoon matinee.|Fresh
It's Everybody Wants Some!! but in space and with Kurt Russell instead of Wyatt Russell.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is a candy-coated cinematic shot of sugar. It'll provide a short [high but] is ultimately unfulfilling.|Rotten
The story, although slightly disjointed this time around, manages to offer up plenty of cosmic whimsy, zany humour and an excellent lead cast that keeps this action-packed sci-fi space-opera very much alive.|Fresh
Having seen more than my share of movies where the filmmakers seem to hoping that that audiences won't notice when their craftsmanship is sloppy, it's refreshing to see a movie that invites viewers to soak in the details.|Fresh
Gunn's love for the Guardians is clear, and by splitting them up and keeping the dual-plot machinations relatively simple, he has the room to explore each characters' inner motivations.|Fresh
the jokes and throw-away gags and irreverent potshots at popular culture and action movie clichés and hero fantasies that felt so smooth and natural the first time around here feel more forced|Rotten
... feel sorry for whatever comes out in the next weekend or two hoping to make money. We all knew this was critic-proof... You already watched it, didn't you?|Fresh
The Guardians are still fun... and funny. But the bloom feels off the rose.|Fresh
It's tremendous fun, even when it could be a little better.|Fresh
A sequel that continues to entertain, but less convincing than the original. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 taps into that childlike glee that comes with sitting in a dark movie theater, ready to see favorite characters travel worlds and fight off aliens.|Fresh
It keeps the elements that captivated the general audience fresh while strengthening some of its weakest points to create a sequel slightly superior to its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a little bit funnier, and shows a smidgen more technical panache, than the first, but sticks to its successful formula, and therefore satisfies in much the same way.|Fresh
This sequel drifts a bit into maudlin sentimentality that has no place in this particular universe, even if this installment is all about daddy issues.|Fresh
Nothing [holds] director James Gunn, whose manic creativity can conjure everything from the creepy, crawly Slither to the live-action Scooby-Doo movies, back this time around.|Fresh
If you were a fan of the first (I was) you'll dig the next chapter, but your enjoyment will depend on your tolerance for redundancy ... and your willingness to succumb to Chris Pratt's humor and hotness.|Fresh
Starts off much like the original, but goes off the rails in the third act. No Marvel movie to date has gone this far south this fast. (Splice Today)|Rotten
The tepid Vol. 2 survives mostly on our affection for the characters we met in the first film, but without that intro, it's a middling slog with precious little of the freshness or audacity that made the original such a standout.|Fresh
The jokey demeanor that informed the first film remains, even if writer-director James Gunn forces too many gags. But the freshness of the characters remains intact, and the actors continue to interact in a manner that supports the narrative spine.|Fresh
There is fun to be had as the team of renegade space pirates return...with some funny, impressive action sequences [but it] turns into a high-concept mess involving reel upon reel of planetary destruction, a VFX cliche we are seeing way too much of.|Fresh
Although the fast-paced plot is convoluted, there are intergalactic battle sequences galore and lots of zany humor.|Fresh
Both hard-core comic fans and more casual movie fans will be happy with the results, though parents may cringe to find Vol. 2 a bit more crude and violent than the first film.|Fresh
"Disney and Marvel haven't learned that less is more. Instead they subscribe to The Lego Movie mentality that ""everything is awesome,"" no matter what."|Rotten
After watching all that jaunty kidcom adventure stuff, I kept getting the feeling that there was a '70's after-school special locked up inside this movie and struggling mightily to get out.|Rotten
"In a world where superhero movies can have the human weight of Logan (2017), you can hardly forgive Galaxy Guardians Vol. 2 for being ""entertaining and nothing more."" But while the movie lasts, the fun is worth it. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
If the first Guardians of the Galaxy is about bizarre heroes developing chemistry, then the sequel is a showcase for them as individuals.|Fresh
Don't walk, don't run....Walkman your way to this out-of-this-world blast of entertainment.|Fresh
There are a lot of morsels here -- dozens, really -- and it starts off the summer with a bang.|Fresh
Feels like a parody of Guardians of the Galaxy.|Rotten
It adroitly balances art and entertainment, character and sensation, laughter and poignancy, and the personal with the packaged.|Fresh
"With ""Vol. 2"" we don't quite have that same joy and wonder of surprise we did the first time around, but Gunn does a great job of taking what worked before and giving it another spin without being repetitive."|Fresh
"Why should every manner of director hanker to make movies that are ""character-driven""? What a terrible phrase that is! It makes drama feel like heavy labor."|Rotten
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 takes everything that worked so well the first time around and amplifies it, establishing itself as one of the most satisfying sequels of recent years.|Fresh
Gunn's script works overtime to repeat the crazy fun of the first part, but the plot lines in Vol 2 are clumsily manufactured.|Rotten
Surprise was part of the original film's delight. But Vol. 2 cranks the volume on the formula. Plus, you know, baby Groot.|Fresh
In much the same way that the film as a whole is better this time around, the performances have also improved... partly because the actors have done a better job of finding just the right approach to the material.|Fresh
"What doesn't work, alas, are the big things: the main story involving Peter and his real space dad, played by Kurt Russell, and the romantic ""unspoken thing"" between Peter and Gamora."|Rotten
Thank you, Mr. Gunn, for starting off our summer movie season on such a high note.|Fresh
Gunn's vision continues to be the most inspired of any director currently working inside of Marvel's universe, and like a dancing Baby Groot I'm pretty sure at this point I'd jive right along to any beat he chooses to lay down next.|Fresh
To a large extent it's coasting on goodwill from the previous film - but the previous film established a lot of goodwill to coast on.|Fresh
I am Groot! 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is a rousing and rollicking galactic trek.|Fresh
For the sequel, Gunn has stuck to the formula that worked so well in the first film, and even if you can feel the strain of repetition, he has come up with another pert, entertaining yarn about the unshakable bonds between intergalactic families.|Fresh
Overall, though, Vol 2 suffers from blockbuster bloat. Hopefully the next installment, hinted at plentifully in the end credits, will recapture the fun-fuelled zing of the original.|Rotten
All sequels repeat the best tricks of their predecessors, but director James Gunn's choice of tricks is way more fun than most ...|Fresh
The most fun I've had in a theater this year and as much fun as the original. This is the kind of fun that made me love movies as a kid and is why I keep reviewing film.|Fresh
What could easily devolve into CGI slapstick manages to stick to the ribs in the two-films-and-counting franchise.|Fresh
Gunn has given us a rousing piece of entertainment with plenty of action, ingenious ideas, and visual effects to engage us at every level. That's as much as anyone could ask of a movie, let alone a sequel.|Fresh
Lots of laughs, thrills, tunes in slightly lesser sequel.|Fresh
How many times is it funny or unexpected to score an action/sci-fi set piece with an incongruent '70s pop song? In the first film, it was a novelty, but nothing kills novelty like monotony.|Rotten
Here's hoping the inevitable Vol. 3 rebuilds some of the first film's heart, because Vol. 2 feels like hollow spectacle, however gorgeously rendered.|Rotten
The fun of the movie is in the characters and their wisecracks ... Five years ago I would not have predicted that the former pro wrestler Bautista would become one of my favorite comic actors, but we live in strange times.|Fresh
... a functional enterprise that seems content more to repeat the accomplishments of its predecessor rather than to branch out in ambitious new directions.|Rotten
Fun, action, nonsense, classic rock, and over-the-top situations abound. Popcorn is optional.|Fresh
Marvel bloat has unfortunately affected one of its liveliest properties in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , but there is still great, snarky stuff here.|Fresh
Beneath its fast-paced story, great visuals and a toe-tapping, mixed-tape soundtrack, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is a story of family - in all its dysfunctional glory.|Fresh
Still lively and likeable, despite the sprawling techno-bloat and general over-stuffing.|Fresh
It's enjoyable and entertaining enough to earn a recommendation. I just wish the basic plot was as good as the characters. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
"Funny, but sometimes annoying, ""Vol. 2"" lacks the magic of the original. But that is not say it isn't worth seeing."|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the first MCU film to talk down to its audience.|Rotten
This second volume is pretty terrific, a must-see. It suffers a bit from being a sequel in that characters are already firmly defined. (The revelation of their personas was a plus in the previous film.)|Fresh
Second verse, same as the first. ... But when the first verse was as good as Guardians of the Galaxy, it's hard to complain too much.|Fresh
More of the same feels like less.|Rotten
"There's a thin line between just enough and too much, and ""Guardians Vol. 2"" trips over that line and never gets back up."|Rotten
Often loud, occasionally obnoxious and so consistently convinced of its own awesomeness that it will not, it cannot, stop pointing out everything that makes it so utterly wonderful.|Rotten
The soundtrack has bigger hits, Groot is an even bigger scene-stealer, and the villain problem has been solved. But it's all a means to the heart of the story: Family. And not that Fast & Furious nonsense either.|Fresh
"Darker ""Guardians 2"" still great fun."|Fresh
It hurtles past at dizzying speed with a slew of new characters, soap opera-like motivations and confrontations, and goofy-ridiculous adventures, tasking audiences to keep up with it all.|Rotten
It's a movie that shows the confidence of a blockbuster that knows what it has to do to earn the adoration of its audience. [Full review in Portuguese]|Fresh
...insists on trying to wear big-boy blockbuster pants.|Rotten
If ever a movie exemplified the paradox of expectation, it is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.|Fresh
It's overwrought and overlong. Whereas the first Guardians soared, this one kind of lumbers toward the finish line.|Rotten
It's clear that Gunn and company knew exactly what qualities made the first film so enjoyable, and what they needed to do to make sure this particular sequel was worth the wait.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is funny, exciting and touching.|Fresh
"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is fun, no doubt. Action-packed and completely enjoyable. We're just waiting for the evolution of Marvel to take place."|Fresh
Worse than occasionally being a downer, Vol. 2 is something Guardians of the Galaxy never was: dull, often for long stretches.|Rotten
Revealing the preoccupations of its maker, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a petri dish for Gunn to experiment with the idea of family as a construct.|Fresh
"Like ""Let's Twist Again,"" it can't play the same familiar chords with lesser lyrics and expect the same results. It isn't quite the revved-up rallying call for outcasts that the first one was, so this sequel is best approached with lower expectations."|Rotten
Like many a sequel to a slam-bang, much-liked mega-hit, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original - but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch.|Fresh
It didn't turn out as many expected but fortunately isn't a total disaster. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Maybe it's not as original as the first, but it has all the elements to captivate with extravagance and charm. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Inferior to its predecessor, but not by much, fortunately. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 builds on the first movie's strong foundation, with a friendly cast -- notably Pratt, Bautista and Saldana -- and fun action sequences. It's good enough to make a fan look forward to Vol. 3.|Fresh
I'm sure you'll play it all again, Marvel. Next time, though, please give your mostly charismatic creatures a little room to breathe.|Fresh
[It's] Marvel film that feels like it's playing by its own rules now that it has established these characters as runaway favorites, and the sequel definitely has a swagger that feels earned. Mostly, though, I want to tell you about how weird it is.|Fresh
It's dispiriting to settle down for a Guardians of the Galaxy picture only to find you're watching Field of Dreams with added asteroids.|Rotten
A $100 million, obscenely fun superhero movie packed with amazing visuals, groovy tunes, wacky action, and unapologetic schmaltz.|Fresh
"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative."|Rotten
Mildly enjoyable while instantly forgettable ...|Rotten
As with many sequels, Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 takes every single thing (and I mean every tiny detail) audiences enjoyed about the first film and turns it up to 11.|Fresh
[A]n entertaining space adventure that cares more about jokes than action sequences and that, ultimately, cares more about its characters than the jokes.|Fresh
Like the classic rock soundtrack powering this picture, the hits outweigh the misses, yet there are times when one is tempted to press the fast-forward button.|Fresh
The best sequel in years. Though I didn't understand the plot or the dialogue.|Fresh
Watching it is akin to the experience of being trapped in a room with a Golden Retriever that is repeatedly licking you in the face. You'll emerge slightly happy, somewhat dazed, and covered in slobber.|Rotten
A solid and satisfactory sequel that will entertain returning fans as well as new ones. Not as good as the original, yet funnier and more emotional. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Like a visit from amusing friends who stay a bit longer than expected, it's easy to forgive the indulgence.|Fresh
The point is, there's much more right than wrong in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, and enough of the original's jokey spirit to keep you primed for the third mix.|Fresh
Cheeky fun, if not inspired.|Fresh
"""Vol. 2"" might have been a bit more focused. Still, it's an imaginative romp that once again reflects Gunn's unique and irreverent sensibility."|Fresh
We come for the eye-popping visuals and the snarky humor, but we're touched by the emotional ties of the characters...|Fresh
If it's overstuffed in the way of most sequels, well, at least it's stuffed with good cheer.|Fresh
Retains many of the expected stock superhero storylines, but makes up for it with charm and visual brilliance.|Fresh
Trying to make a sequel that was going to be as good or feel as fresh as the original was a near-impossible task, but Gunn has managed to deliver a film that's a hell of a lot of fun to watch, while also giving it depth and heart to spare.|Fresh
Quill's family-versus-friends dilemma aspires to The Empire Strikes Back, but though the tin ear dialogue is certainly Lucas-esque, Vol. 2's thematic reach far extends its grasp.|Rotten
"Joyous, silly, heartfelt, and occasionally majestic. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is alive and thriving, a smart, thrilling, sweet-natured kickoff to the 2017 summer movie season."|Fresh
While the movie lacks the surprise factor of its predecessor, the real delight is just getting to spend time with these wonderful characters again.|Fresh
Fast-paced, bonkers, high-spirited fun: a far-out space-rocket ride with a cast of endearing characters that have definitely found their movie niche and intend to hang onto it.|Fresh
Vol. 2 doesn't take long to get moving, and once it starts, it just goes. There isn't a lot in the way of downtime and there aren't any moments of filler.|Fresh
Vol. 2 isn't a perfect movie, but it's easily Marvel Studios' most emotional offering yet.|Fresh
The sharp comic timing and devil-may-care breeziness of the original only return intermittently, and the new film's emphasis is on family feuds and forgiveness. It's heavy on the feels. There are hugs.|Rotten
If you liked the first movie, well, here's more of it, only not as refreshing or original.|Fresh
Suffers from being too long, but we love these characters too much to complain. Michael Rooker steals the movie in every scene he's in.|Fresh
Volume 2 can claim to be bigger and better than its predecessor, although it still suffers from some of the narrative sleight-of-hand issues that kept Guardians of Galaxy from achieving greatness.|Fresh
The underdog panache of the original has ebbed, and now begins the tedious world-building and brand-building that becomes necessary when you make $700 million at the box office.|Rotten
Overstuffed...an elephantine sequel to a movie that was lighter on its feet; it tries so hard that the strain shows all too clearly.|Rotten
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not suck after all.|Fresh
In terms of sheer entertainment value, though, this Guardians of the Galaxy ultimately shares just enough with its central quintet -- rather heroically getting the job done, even if the trip from here to there can be a bit disjointed and messy.|Fresh
Director James Gunn still has a lot of plates to spin in terms of plot and characters, but operating under the assumption that the audience is caught up, things feel more focused than the original.|Fresh
It's stupid-smart bits... that make up for the more routine aspects of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.|Fresh
I wouldn't call it a game changer, but a great superhero film overall.|Fresh
I suppose there's a kind of genius in Gunn's ability to remember what made him laugh in fourth grade, but if your sense of what's funny hasn't grown a tad more sophisticated since you were in primary school, then...|Rotten
There's enough there to make Vol. 2 worth seeing. I just hope the creators go back to being weirder and looser in Vol. 3.|Fresh
Extraordinarily funny|Fresh
It might lack the freshness of part one - which, quite frankly, is almost impossible to reproduce in a sequel - but the heart and humor are fully intact.|Fresh
Vol. 2 isn't the jolt that the first one was, but between all the action and its surprisingly poignant finale, it's a welcome addition.|Fresh
Vol. 2 is as goofy a delight as its predecessor.|Fresh
Frenetic and frequently funny, Vol. 2 moves so mercifully fast that we hardly notice the narrative potholes.|Fresh
The best thing Gunn has going for him is that even when he gets off the best beat for the movie, his cast is so talented and breathes so much life into their roles that they can cover up any small dark holes in this Galaxy.|Fresh
"Gunn really excels in icing his cake, references to 'Cheers,' Pac-Man and ""Mary Poppins"" not only amusing but integral, much like the juvenile name calling that occurs throughout."|Fresh
Loud, shallow, mindless, slightly overlong and soulless, but so what? At least it still has plenty of eye candy, a little bit of wit, and a giddy, self-deprecating sense of humor intact which makes it entertaining on a purely visceral level.|Fresh
The movie does not quite reach the giddy heights of its predecessor, but that was always going to be a tall order.|Fresh
Gunn works hard to deliver a sequel that delivers on the promise of the original film. There are times when you can feel him straining under the weight of expectations, but for the most part, he delivers.|Fresh
The acting is impeccable and the special effects are incredible.|Fresh
"Though individually and as a group the Guardians don't do anything they didn't do in the first film, ""Vol. 2's"" insistence on hitting everything twice as hard soon becomes wearing."|Rotten
Doubles down on the things that made the first film a hit|Fresh
The first movie was such a surprise and so damn charming, that it's impossible for Vol. 2/i> to regain that feeling, but it makes its own, and it owns it. Even if it didn't it has baby Groot.|Fresh
Likable and irreverently funny for what it is.|Fresh
"[In the end credits] you get to hear ""Flashlight"" by that original group of interstellar misfits, Parliament. ""GotG 2"" may not have its predecessor's shock of the new, but any film that introduces the current generation to P-Funk can't be all bad."|Fresh
Still delightfully off-kilter, still deliciously irreverent, and still delectably scored with 70's pop songs.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 wanders, but that doesn't mean it's lost.|Fresh
It's Gamora's universe and Saldana's movie, something you notice whenever it lurches to a halt (often) or you're confronted by Pratt's lackluster acting|Fresh
"""Guardians 2"" throws a lot into the pot, but it keeps all the elements clear and finds ways to have fun at every turn."|Fresh
"If the first one didn't exist, this one would seem revolutionary. But the first one does, and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"" for all its charms, will live in its shadow."|Fresh
The best moments of Gunn's follow-up to his 2014 hit have an unfettered filmmaking joy - a knowing, kinetic pleasure that comes with a wink and some adolescent wish fulfilment.|Fresh
"All of the attention to detail by Gunn and his crew pays off handsomely in making ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" the eye candy it is."|Fresh
"Seeing the massive Drax coddle and protect Baby Groot is typical of their love for one another, and that translates into a ""family"" we can all admire."|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 probably couldn't, and definitely doesn't, recapture the sweet and singular silliness of the original, though the new edition from Marvel Studios and Disney has its rewards.|Rotten
The Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has found its little, expletive-inflected corner of the Marvel universe and it frolics there, shooting down its enemies and shooting off its mouth.|Fresh
Its unique action scenes and the palpable chemistry of the lead actors continues to make this Marvel's most entertaining franchise.|Fresh
Vol. 2 understands well that the action is memorable because of who it's happening to and around, and Gunn never loses that sense of character.|Fresh
It's a rare misstep for the usually sure-footed folks behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe.|Rotten
The Guardians of the Galaxy movies are allowed to simply be movies rather than bridges to other, future Marvel franchises. It frees them up to be fun.|Fresh
The rare Hollywood CGI orgy that doesn't take itself deadly seriously-like the current plague of superhero movies-and wants to be as purely entertaining as possible.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 doubles-down on everything that audiences loved about its predecessor, to still-entertaining but diminished returns.|Fresh
The pivotal realization--that, in the end, using your heart beats using your head--works as a pithy instruction manual for this diverting but disposable adventure.|Fresh
Already damned with faint raves (lots of fun, so likable, but not quite as fresh as the original), Guardians Vol. 2 is a better, more satisfying movie.|Fresh
GOTG Vol.2 is very good at two things: laughing at its own perceived comic brilliance, and slo-mo sequences of characters walking forth to Fleetwood Mac or Cheap Trick.|Rotten
"Much like a classic mix tape, ""Vol. 2"" of [the series] is a movie that's similar in theme to its predecessor but feels fresh and original."|Fresh
If Vol 1 was a mixed tape of great numbers, Vol 2 simply swaps out the songs with like-for-like beats and turns the volume way up.|Fresh
It coasts on the lazy assumption that references to 1980s video games can be the punchline to any joke.|Rotten
Much like its predecessor, Vol. 2 rests contentedly on its lush color palette and retro soundtrack to try and trick you into thinking you're not watching a Marvel movie.|Rotten
As a remake [of The Empire Strikes Back] it'll do until Rian Johnson's attempt in December.|Fresh
If the original was a space opera, the sequel is more like a soap opera with complicated and angry familial relationships determining the action.|Fresh
Enormous fun.|Fresh
...another easy-rock-scored galaxy-saving adventure whose heavier emotional content enhances, instead of distracts from, what a blast they and the audience are having.|Fresh
It brings the fun and is packed full of belly-laugh moments and dazzling visuals.|Fresh
The jokes are good, the music's super cheesy, but the galaxy doesn't seem in too much peril.|Fresh
...aims to please with breathtaking set pieces that'll convince you to delete all your old diatribes about CGI ruining the movies. But... too many of the punch lines are referential; how much comedy can you milk from the mere mention of David Hasselhoff?|Rotten
While Baby Groot is almost painfully adorable, it's Bautista's hilariously open-hearted Drax who steals the show.|Fresh
You'll (probably) have more fun watching this than any other film this year.|Fresh
This is James Gunn taking his hundreds of millions of dollars and trying something more personal and heartfelt than one might have expected from a film whose ensemble include a trash panda, a twig and a woman with antennae protruding from her head.|Fresh
Gunn really leans into the old-school space opera vibe established in the first film. The music, as expected, is spectacular.|Fresh
The original Guardians of the Galaxy from 2014 had a freshness to its humour and introduced audiences to a set of novel characters; unfortunately, the sequel is overstuffed with ageing movie stars trying to get a slice of the action.|Rotten
Gunn's solo sequel just about manages to pull it all off again, despite a little less-than-Marvellous confusion.|Fresh
Vol. 2 still has the loosey-goosey feel of a rogue epic that the kids made when the grown-ups weren't watching. Only a turd blossom could resist it.|Fresh
Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 may not boast the same polished storytelling, but this Groot scootin' interplanetary disco once again kicks ass on James Gunn's own zany terms.|Fresh
Vol 2 isn't as spectacularly zingy as its predecessor - the law of diminishing returns applies in spades to the shock power of genre-subverting cinema - but that inevitability apart, the sequel is every inch an equal.|Fresh
As with the surprisingly excellent original, it's the dynamic between the cast that draws you in.|Fresh
It ends up standing alongside Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron as another example of the Marvel sophomore slump.|Rotten
While it's perhaps a little fanciful to look for profound messages in this film, Gunn does have valid things to say about the importance, or otherwise, of family ties.|Fresh
It is often vastly entertaining and there is plenty of whizz-bang fun in a film that feels like a bumper edition of classic sci-fi TV - a Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica.|Fresh
If you're looking for a popcorn lobotomy, and I mean that in a good way, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is the space comedy for you.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 amps up what you loved about the first film, but a frustratingly unfocused plot keeps it from surpassing its predecessor.|Fresh
Guardians 2 zips around the universe with so much exhilarating charm and megawatt dazzle - in addition to serving up a big helping of heart - that you'll even forgive it for the few moments where it gets a bit too big and bites off more than it should.|Fresh
Gunn has made an invigorating, overstuffed light show that hones itself into something rather striking by the end. And, yes, Baby Groot is pretty cute.|Fresh
It's a very good sequel that can't quite recapture the greatness of its breath of fresh air predecessor.|Fresh
In a perfect cinematic universe, every sequel would be like The Godfather Part II... In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, which coasts pleasantly enough on familiarity and a few bright new touches.|Fresh
Good entertainment with specially inspired scenes, but stays below the first film on everything. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
James Gunn achieves a film that perfectly combines emotional moments with humor of all kinds. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
More entertaining, more inventive and more cosmic than its predecessor. It already belongs to the ranking Marvel's best. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The best part of this second film (more will come) is also the worst: it looks too much like the original. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Maybe the sequel doesn't have the freshness of the first film, but still quite entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Overall, it feels like spending time with old friends again, and the use of depth and size contrasts in the 3D is spectacular, if a lot to take in at times.|Fresh
Not quite reaching the all-out perfection of the original, Guardians Vol. 2 is still a brilliantly cool addition to the MCU, soundtracked at every beat with nostalgic hooky lines and riffs, and mostly delivering on the promise of the first.|Fresh
Thinks it's edgy and transgressive, the punk little brother of all those other stodgy comic-book movies, but it isn't. It's just slightly more candy-colored.|Rotten
"Any action film that sets its opening sequence to ELO's ""Mister Blue Sky"" can't be all bad, but the ""Guardians"" franchise will need more than an excellent vinyl collection from here on out."|Fresh
The smallness of the story - it's all about petty gripes, projected as a threat to the whole galaxy - hampers the unironic aspiration to infinite wonder, which powers the cosmic reaches of the Marvel universe.|Fresh
How Gunn handles the topic of fatherhood within the sphere of a big budget comic book movie is to be commended, and just might bring on a few tears.|Fresh
When Guardians of the Galaxy launched in 2014, it was a pure blast; the antithesis to the morose Batman. Now, it is effectively a wake in a candy shop, where nobody knows if they should be crying or getting giddy on sweets.|Rotten
The ensemble comedy formula holds true for the sequel, but this time, returning writer-director James Gunn hits the jokes with a lighter touch and makes sure to integrate the humour with the action.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 is a relentlessly joyful, heart-pounding, exhilarating slab of pure wonderment.|Fresh
While this Guardians of the Galaxy has no earnest belief in its sci-fi theatrics, it believes surprisingly sincerely in its characters' inner lives, the ones buried beneath their sarcastic exteriors.|Fresh
First, the titular figures were space pirates with laughs. Now, they're all of the above, but with an earned sense of heart.|Fresh
Doubles down on everything that was great about the first film.|Fresh
[A] grand and worthy sequel that packs an emotional wallop and brilliant visuals.|Fresh
Not only does Gunn make the galaxy look like a rainbow exploding in slow motion, his still framing of particular action sequences soak in like a comic panel in motion.|Fresh
While there might not be much in the way of story, there's a lot of character development.|Fresh
An enjoyable ride, yet less innovative than its predecessor, mostly expanding upon existing plot lines, jokes and glitzy action sequences.|Fresh
This film is the epitome of a sequel to a somewhat unexpected smash hit.|Fresh
Nestling somewhere between enjoyable spectacle and excellence, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is another case where bigger doesn't always mean better.|Fresh
Special cameos, bright space explosions, a kick-ass soundtrack and Chris Pratt's abs make Guardians of the Galaxy a film worth exploring.|Fresh
James Gunn actually has some things to say about family and fatherhood amongst this tail of aliens, space battles and space gods.|Fresh
This is the film equivalent of when your uncle walks into the room with a Sonic Youth t-shirt on, and then under bemused interrogation, he admits to having no idea they were even a band - he just likes the design.|Rotten
The choice soundtrack, accompanied by the candyfloss aesthetic make for moments of fun, but it ultimately lacks the originality of the first.|Fresh
The vibe is corporate, and of the most depressing kind: It's not enough that you've paid for this product. You have to sit through commercials for the next one and the next and the next.|Rotten
"Will everyone enjoy ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2""? Of course. But if this franchise is going to survive, the producers of Vol. 3 better invest a bit more in script development and a bit less on explosions."|Fresh
From the obligatory Stan Lee cameo to the also-obligatory post-credits sequences, Marvel knows its audience.|Fresh
It's a shame that instead of conquering new worlds, Gunn concentrated his efforts on trying to make lightning strike twice.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 bursts unto the screen like a pack of rainbow skittles. It's a roaring space adventure with humor and heart.|Fresh
Gunn's soundtrack picks also come as a surprise and work exceptionally well -- there's a scene where Star-Lord and Baby Groot cozy up while listening to Cat Stevens' Father and Son that might find you looking for a hanky underneath your popcorn tub.|Fresh
An interesting experiment in telling a blockbuster story with a whole bunch of b-plots, and nary an a-plot in sight.|Fresh
Still funny and fun, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a welcome return for our oddball heroes but it is a far more traditional comic book movie than the irreverent original.|Fresh
This Guardians finally hits the gloriously ridiculous extremes that the first adventure never quite reached|Fresh
The introduction of family bonds as a unifying theme represents Gunn's most decisive break from the original's winning formula. Aside from that, the second verse is same as the first.|Fresh
It's fine, it's familiar, it's got Kurt Russell and a cute Groot so of course it'll make a motza.|Fresh
The motley crew of intergalactic protectors are back in this eye-popping and wildly entertaining space opera that turns the banter dial up a notch.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes at us grinning from ear-to-ear for nearly two and a half hours. It's high on its own supply.|Rotten
The movie will make fans happy, very happy, and it will reduce everyone else to a mass of cooing, goo-goo-ing ninnies, all in the thrall of a character named Baby Groot.|Fresh
Once Vol. 2 begins, it grabs you immediately.|Fresh
For the sequel, writer-director James Gunn has doubled down on all his once-nifty novelties. Strip them away and what remains is a bloated semi-mess.|Rotten
At its worst, it comes across like a vulgar birthday party hosted by an indulgent billionaire for a hard-to-please stepchild|Rotten
"The cliched ""difficult second album"". Sure, the first one will always be your favourite, but you know you'll grow to love this one almost as much."|Fresh
Marvel does it again in this delightful, stand-alone sequel.|Fresh
"Like a number of Marvel ""part 2"" entries, it suffers from the push-pull between being a smaller, more character-driven sequel and providing the required mega-bucks action and spectacle."|Rotten
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 answers questions posed by the first movie by exploring its cast of colorful miscreants in a way that almost makes it an anti-blockbuster.|Fresh
Stuck on rewind in space.|Fresh
Where the original Guardians felt fresh, Vol. 2 now feels familiar -- sometimes pleasantly so and sometimes not.|Fresh
From its huge opening sequence to the last cameo, this easily stands up to its predecessor.|Fresh
The characters are still fun to be around, the one-liners are still sharp and the soundtrack is, of course, terrific.|Fresh
The second Guardians Of The Galaxy is Marvel Studios near its best: spectacular, funny and with a very likeable self-mocking quality.|Fresh
"In the lively and unabashedly sentimental ""Vol. 2,"" our space heroes battle for their lives. But the real stakes concern how these characters make peace with estranged fathers, dangerous siblings and feuding comrades-in-arms."|Fresh
Vol. 2 is filler, to be sure, but if you like the flavor of these movies, you'll enjoy this second bite.|Fresh
Ultimately, Vol. 2 can't quite live up to the legacy of the first film, but it's got everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 exists in its own little bubble and this movie is better off for it.|Fresh
In its best moments, the movie is irresistible escapism of the highest order, a scrappy, wisecracking cousin to Star Wars circa 1977. However, Vol. 2 can cruise on autopilot for a touch too long at times.|Fresh
If this new Guardians lacks the novelty of its predecessor it retains the unnerving edge of hysteria, with ever more frequent reminders that nearly all the protagonists have trauma in their past.|Fresh
Despite its shortcomings, which are more about tone control than anything else, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a huge amount of fun.|Fresh
"If you're wondering when the picture roars back to life, it's when the enthusiastic Pratt excitedly tells his God-Father he's going to ""make some weird s***"". I assume that's when Gunn started taking his own advice."|Fresh
The laid back freewheeling groove disguising a remarkably smooth and accomplished ride. The design and sense of scale are dazzling sophisticated.|Fresh
It stands out more than some of the more routine films of the MCU, but whereas the first can still fairly fight it out in the top few, this is decidedly more middle of the road.|Fresh
Apart from the pleasure in seeing old characters in new ways, there's also all the eye candy surrounding them. Marvel has never stinted on special effects, but this film is practically psychedelic.|Fresh
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.|Rotten
The wonderful worldbuilding, strong character work and gag-packed script make Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 one of the Marvel Universe's worthiest and most original sequels, building on the the original while not relying on repetition.|Fresh
There was a lot riding on the return of Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and the rest to the MCU, and Gunn can be satisfied that he has delivered with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.|Fresh
It's still a good Marvel movie (at times, a very good one), but it's a come down from the dizzying highs of the first installment. The laughs are still there, but they're less involuntary.|Fresh
Bar a few last-act wobbles and the odd tonal shift, Gunn has done it again, crafting a sequel that keeps the focus on the characters we fell for first time around while pumping up the volume.|Fresh
This sequel turns up the volume on the action and spectacle for a fun and frequently thrilling ride, but can't help but feel like a disappointment in comparison to its predecessor.|Fresh
There's no denying that it looks amazing. The action sequences, too, leave little to be desired as the Guardians find their footing again by working together in their own, haphazard and unique way.|Fresh
Compared to its predecessor, Guardians 2 has a hollow emotional core, and the plotting feels clumsy. This movie doesn't have any real purpose, even as a bridge to other chapters in the Marvel story.|Rotten
The action's great, the performances are top notch, and the soundtrack is killer. 2017's first Marvel movie is, impressively, one of the best sci-fi adventures you could hope to see. I defy anyone to watch this and not smile from beginning to end.|Fresh
That sense of gooey euphoria runs through everything that's good in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, which inches even further to the end of the limb the original Guardians film went out on in 2014.|Fresh
It's fun, though GOTG2 doesn't have the same sense of weird urgency and point that the first film had.|Fresh
Shot for shot, line and line, it's an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle. Yet this time you can sense just how hard the series' wizard of a director, James Gunn, is working to entertain you.|Fresh
It's a true masterclass in storytelling, and Gunn's screenplay is tantamount to this, particularly impressive in how we understand and care for this myriad of characters - not always an easy task where ensemble features of this nature are concerned.|Fresh
Gunn remains a wizard of a nearly impossible task. The ex-Troma director is ideally suited to transform what should be a hokey B-movie into one of Marvel's most audacious ongoing storylines.|Fresh
The second film is far denser and has a few more pacing and story problems than the first. Still, it's a very good movie with one of the most emotionally impactful endings of any Marvel Cinematic Universe story yet.|Fresh
Even the things people liked about the first movie get exaggerated until it's not cute anymore. Since everyone loved the blacklight joke, there are now constant sex jokes. Everyone loved Baby Groot in one scene, so now he's in the whole movie.|Rotten
Just like the first one, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a winning and wonderfully relatable gem of crazy.|Fresh
"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" doesn't claim the title from its predecessor, but that does not make it a disappointment. The first film is a slice of percussive squash-buckling perfection that it was its own hard act to follow."|Fresh
While the sequel doesn't pack the full punch of the original, it's a wonderful follow-up that is richly dense in detail and features a parade of thrilling and fun surprises.|Fresh
Visually stunning, the film is a blast: a joyous sci-fi fantasy outing filled with weird and wonderful characters, cheeky humour and a plot that offers just the right blend of emotional glue. It soars on the wings of imagination.|Fresh
