You may not enjoy what you see but I'll be damned if it doesn't stay with you regardless.|Fresh
An engaging racial drama from the master of the craft Spike Lee.|Fresh
Cultural awareness doesn't qualify as empathy. Director Spike Lee crafts a testament to that without overt finger-pointing.|Fresh

Lee brings his stylized esthetic and flair for genre-flipping to this kooky fact-based story.|Fresh
Another of the great militant films of Spike Lee.|Fresh
Spike somehow juggles a sharp sense of humor with a sharp critique of racial politics, not only keeping every ball afloat, but mesmerizing us with both entertainment and impact.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is exactly the kind of movie we need in our racially-fraught climate.|Fresh
The cross-racial team-up of Zimmerman and Stallworth allows BlacKkKlansman to become much more instructional for white viewers than it is for black ones, since we black Americans have lived with the realities of the race-based violence all our lives.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman makes a bold political statement about racism in an effective way.|Fresh
He's (Lee) attempted to make a blockbuster, laugh out loud comedy about the Ku Klux Klan whilst also sincerely critiquing contemporary race relations. For the most part, he succeeds.|Fresh
This story and the way it is presented to us feels like something very fresh in showing the anger and hatred that can exist in the human being only for having a different skin tone. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is a film that plays fast and loose with the true story on which it's based, but it's all done in service to the narrative and to the message, both of which are worth conveying.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is the perfect movie for the perfect time and just goes to prove you never know who might be on the other end of that phone who will change your life for the better or the worse.|Fresh
Given the current political climate, and the high racial tensions in society, you have to laugh at the outrageous humor to keep yourself from crying at the extreme racism in this film. BlacKKKlansman was entertaining, insightful and ever so timely.|Fresh
Lee's film is well done, although it does get a little heavy-handed at times.|Fresh
"""The militancy of Lee is more than obvious, but BlackKklansman is not a political-racial pamphlet""."|Fresh
Spike Lee returns to the big leagues with a comedy that in between the laughs, hides a profoundly dark reality. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
There are very few films that have enough guts to break the barrier of the politically correct and show the truth as it is. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
In any other hands, this film could have been relegated to a mediocre biopic toeing the line between political validity and a safe marketability. What we get instead is a film that will stay in your mind for a while after leaving the cinema.|Fresh
Lee lets us see that there is a lot of hatred, but also a lot of ignorance, a lot of ridiculousness and a lot of stupidity, which brings humor in the film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Aside from its obviously surprising label of 'based on a true story', BlacKkKlansman complies with the tone of Spike Lee and manages to stay real. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose|Fresh
The film's most powerful passages are lengthy digressions that abandon the plot to mourn the role of Lee's beloved chosen art form, cinema, in the stoking of racism; and to condemn the public political encouragement of racial violence.|Fresh
Finds Lee fully honed in on message with one of the most timely, engaging and thought-provoking films of his career.|Fresh
Lee is after the big stuff - namely, the endless civil war roiling at the core of our society, more than ever ready to boil over - and to that end he pulls out all the stops|Fresh
...what makes BlacKkKlansman such a good film is just how challenging it is.|Fresh
Hopefully this film will inspire others to either start or continue speaking out about injustices, wherever they may arise. All power to all the people.|Fresh
The humor in BlacKkKlansman is occasionally overdone, and yet it never dilutes the suspense.|Fresh
Set over 30 years ago, the potent relevancy of this film is in how the language it mocks is now part of the national discourse, emanating out of the White House itself.|Fresh
The film works well when Washington puts on his white voice to prank call Klansmen. He aspirates the word white with the precision Diane Keaton brought to the word wheat in Love and Death...|Fresh
With a great narrative, stunning visuals, compelling leads and sobering themes, BlacKkKlansman is a uniquely powerful experience, perfect for today's socio-political climate.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman raises some interesting questions about the cost of denying one's heritage and whether it is possible to change a flawed system from the inside out.|Fresh
"I can just imagine a white couple--in their tiny bubble of perfect living--deciding to see that ""comedy about a black guy joining the KKK"". Little did they know their bubble would soon be popped by Lee, whose finger is pointed directly at them."|Fresh
As polemical as you would expect from the black political activist director.|Fresh
At the heart of the film is the struggle of a man attempting to assimilate vastly different groups while keeping true to his own identity.|Fresh
Lee knows that there is a need to place history on the table again and starts the conversation and then leaves us the transformed heritage, the war cry turned into an invitation to change: all power to all people. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A word of praise for the energetic performances by Washington and Driver and an awesome score by jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard.|Fresh
A necessity to see in theatres. Utterly entertaining and heartfelt with a wallop of truth waiting for you at the end.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is so fresh and rich with ideas that you can forgive its shortcomings.|Fresh
Sharp and perceptive, unfiltered, confrontational, and driven by a deep dramatic current that sees reality without varnish or sanitation.|Fresh
Blackkklansma is one of those films that effectively channel energy, exhibit conviction and even excess in some passages and Lee presents this story in an intensely seductive manner. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman would not be what it is without the two protagonists.[Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An authentic masterpiece where genre film and political filmmaking combine to perfection. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Blackkklansman is the best Spike Lee film in years. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"With Blackkklansman, Lee demonstrates that post-racial America never existed, that hate triumphed and, consequently, launches from its trench an umpteenth call to ""wake up."" [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman, like a serious caricature, it is an oxymoron in itself, sadly funny, peacefully violent and absolutely necessary. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It won't wind up as the best film of the year, but I'll be surprised if something tops it as the timeliest.|Fresh
One of the most compelling movies of the year because of its eyebrow-raising true-life story, one performed so well by the likes of Washington, Driver, and, in a masterpiece of tone control, Topher Grace.|Fresh
Lee has taken the opportunity to deliver an existentially crazy police procedural that ends up saying more about society's disease than many a sober-sided Oscar-chaser.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is in constant dialogue with itself, since, like its protagonist, its very method involves pooling available resources and utilizing an oppressive industry as a tool for liberation.|Fresh
This disc is barebones, so Spike Lee fans will have settle for a solid transfer of the film itself when relishing this fo' real, fo' real sh*t at home.|Fresh
"The name ""Spike Lee"" isn't always synonymous with subtlety (this is the guy that made ""Bamboozled"" after all) but in ""BlacKkKlansman"" he finds a balance that exceeds even his greatest work."|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is a poor detective tale and simple-minded Millennial noir because Stallworth's exposé of a sect of American racists and terrorist (all unhealthy-looking white miscreants) never feels like discovery, just a continuation of his hip cynicism.|Rotten
"Crazy funny and at times and gripping. It's a kick in the pants of ol' boy politics as the civil rights movement began to look like something the ""majority"" feared."|Fresh
The film's tonal constant is the brilliant Washington, giving confident comic timing and no-bullshit charisma to match any recent star-making performance.|Fresh
The film, as uneven as it is interesting, rises at the end with some images that disrupt the feelings that the film sometimes failed to emote. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The stupendous chemistry between the leads and the precision of the entire ensemble fill this movie with credibility on an already incredible story. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Visually dynamic with vivid storytelling and award-worthy performances, this Spike Lee joint is an absolute must see film in theaters and one that will resonate long after the somber, powerful coda.|Fresh
Say what you want about the film, but the crux of it is this - Lee is furious, and you should be too.|Fresh
More than a film it resembles an audiovisual assertion and... does not bring anything new to the subject, beyond emphasizing the prejudices and narrow-mindedness of certain individuals, something that everyone already knows. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Ties the story to the present day and feels specifically calculated to send audiences home shaken, angry and charged-up to ""do something."""|Fresh
More relaxed, less serious, however, the message is the same. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Spike Lee doesn't draw upon the past for parallels to today's horror show. Instead, Spike Lee draws a straight line between the hate of yesterday and the hate of today.|Fresh
It is hard to deny that it is one of Spike Lee's greatest films in recent years. Some may even rank it among his all-time best films.|Fresh
If racism was in retreat in 1980 Lee shows that it never went away, and has now returned in force.|Fresh
Perhaps BlacKkKlansman's greatest asset is Lee's ability to embrace the complications of race and identity along with the broad strokes.|Fresh
A seething account of a true story complete with fine performances, penetrating writing and (sadly) timely messages - it's unmissable.|Fresh
This a film that resonates in today's political climate - with Lee the perfect visionary to bring this story to life. It's easily his best work since Malcolm X.|Fresh
"What would it have taken for Spike Lee to go balls to the walls like he did on his best film ""Do The Right Thing""? We'll never know."|Rotten
Are the parallels of this story to current affairs sometimes presented too on the nose? Sure, but that also makes them more resonant. Sometimes things need to be clear and not clouded in half-telegraphed metaphors.|Fresh
Arriving at a time when racial tensions in America are teetering on a knife's edge, Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman could be the year's most important and relevant piece of cinema.|Fresh
I'm pretty sure there's something awfully powerful here, though. It's great filmmaking, of course - and something more.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is Spike Lee's most ambitious film in years; throwing as many logs on the fire of racial stereotyping as he can, while milking solid performances from John David Washington, Adam Driver, and - of all people - Topher Grace.|Fresh
Fans of Lee's work will recognize so many of his trademarks, while also getting a chance to see him tackle something new.|Fresh
Like a lot of Spike Lee's better films, BlacKkKlansman mixes comedic satire with barely suppressed rage.|Fresh
While BlacKkKlansman may unfold as a triptych of rage, fun and pride, what it is is a call to fly at full-staff the willingness to preserve good.|Fresh
It takes a filmmaker like Spike Lee to continually remind us how little we've progressed in 242 years. BlacKkKlansman is the ultimate form of entertainment, funny, emotional, and timely.|Fresh
Lee employs all of his considerable skill and filmmaking prowess, developing a narrative that is at once blunt and nuanced, horrifying and funny in the most unexpected ways.|Fresh
It's wild and messy, thought-provoking and utterly damning, all while being supremely entertaining.|Fresh
With BlackkKlansman, it feels like his [Lee's] entire career has been leading to this moment. Lee was ready and delivers some of the best work of his career.|Fresh
The first thing you will notice as you watch this film, and be distracted by, is how much Washington sounds like his father, Denzel Washington. Once you get over this, the story draws you in.|Fresh
The film walks a line between comedy and drama to tell the story of Ron Stallworth. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The parallels between the seemingly archaic political climate depicted here and what's subsequently re-emerged in Trump's America, is the polemical bent of Lee's film.|Fresh
A very funny movie about the very unfunny persistence of white supremacy in American culture.|Fresh
"""BlackKKlansman"" Lee gives a dissertation on the potency of satire before hitting the audience with a K.O. It's a movie ""rope a dope,"" from the canvas look up and Spike Lee is daring us to wake up."|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is a radical movie for a radical time with a radical director at its helm.|Fresh
There's nobody left in Hollywood making broad, sweeping, lively political melodramas like Spike Lee.|Fresh
An ambitious comedy/drama/ thriller that reflects the history of American anti-black racism.|Fresh
Perhaps the film doesn't have any interest in subtlety. Its true purpose is to say what it has to say loudly, with striking visuals that hit you right in the pit of your stomach.|Fresh
Likely to spark debate about how much America has changed... and not changed over the past few decades, BlacKkKlansman is a winning black comedy.|Fresh
This is a film that is both enjoyable and intelligent with director Spike Lee making one of the most thought-provoking films of the year.|Fresh
Part of the blank quality of the film's hero might be due to the fact that the actor playing him, John David Washington, handsome son of Denzel Washington, is too poker-faced in his delivery.|Rotten
Lee is able to flip things on a dime, jerking the audience from laughter into a dead silence.|Fresh
Yet, despite conforming to formula at almost every turn, BlackKkKlansman is still an excellent film, in equal parts comic and thrilling.|Fresh
The film shines through its performances.|Fresh
Spike Lee is a political activist and 'jive artist' of note so you would not be surprised that Blackkklansman is not just strong cinema but strong on propaganda, too.|Fresh
This is Lee's best film for a long time and one that lassos the topic of white supremacy and racism in a highly entertaining way.|Fresh
Washington's portrayal of Ron Stallworth is humorous and understated, but powerful.|Fresh
An incisive critique that demonstrates Lee's ability to relate events from more than forty years ago, with America's current social state. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Lee's extraordinary film doubles as a visceral entertainment and an urgent reminder of a past we haven't been able to shake.|Fresh
It's just about perfect in balance of tone, and it's easily Spike Lee's best film in years.|Fresh
It's funny, suspenseful and educational.|Fresh
It's been ages since any of Lee's fiction features have been so clear-headed and driven by a need to make bold, epochal declarations about The State Of American Culture.|Fresh
A return to form...the acting was really good, surprisingly from the Klansmen.|Fresh
Easily a top-five movie I've seen this year...I was floored by how much I really liked this movie, especially the last five minutes.|Fresh
Spike Lee has turned in a pro-cop film has to be counted one of the stranger cultural developments of 2018, but Lee seems to have accidentally aligned with cops in the course of issuing an anti-Trump broadside.|Rotten
Superb acting by Washington, Driver, Patrice Dumas and the rest of the cast. Inventive camera work and editing by Chayse Irvin and Barry Alexander Brown respectively, highlighting differences in racial perspectives.|Fresh
Most of all though, with its abrupt shifts of tone and mood, BlacKkKlansman is also very, very funny.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is an extremely well made movie and for one that talks about the power of cinema.|Fresh
John David Washington... look for this guy... he's able to capture a lot of humor... a lot of tragedy with his character.|Fresh
Ultimately that lack of subtlety and the awkwardness hurts this movie a lot.|Rotten
So whatever your religion, race or sexual orientation, make sure you see BlacKkKlansman. Take some time to digest it and really think about both what it's saying and what is happening in the world today. It's time to start paying attention|Fresh
It's a fascinating story, told by people with skill and passion, but it also keeps trying to teach us something by adding to it, as though the filmmakers don't trust the impact of the lessons inherent in the material.|Fresh
Lee balances unexpected shifts between humor and drama, camaraderie and horror, entertainment and history lesson, popcorn-muncher and experimental indie with a fluidity few other directors could muster.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman may be the most accessible, and perhaps most entertaining, work of Lee's latter day career but it is also his most important.|Fresh
funny, but often mordantly so in a way that forces you to confront how racism itself is fundamentally absurd even as it stands at the core of centuries of social injustice.|Fresh
Stallworth's operation is just one small victory in an ongoing struggle, and Lee makes sure we leave the theater knowing that struggle is far from over.|Fresh
So no matter how effective the suspense of this dangerous mission, it all pales in comparison to [its] display of empathy.|Fresh
What I especially love is how the movie refuses to offer up any pat or easy answers.|Fresh
A vital piece of Americana, an incendiary work and [Lee's] best film in over a decade.|Fresh
The movie's sharp sense of humour is at its peak in our hero's phone calls to Klan head David Duke, who remains utterly oblivious to teases of Stallworth's true identity.|Fresh
The racism is astonishing, while the parallels with the Trump era are underlined with all the (lack of) subtlety we expect from Lee.|Fresh
The ironic, almost campy tone sugars the racist language to make you swallow more than you might otherwise stomach...|Fresh
Spike Lee brings humor and a hard-hitting message to bizarre true story about the KKK.|Fresh
Spike Lee is one of the best directors of his generation. BlacKKKlansman assures him of that title|Fresh
Until the closing shots of BlacKkKlansman, director and co-writer Spike Lee does more than control the rage. He refines it with riotous wit into a stiletto, and is all the more lethal for that.|Fresh
The film might have had a wider impact if Lee has resisted grandstanding and allowed Stallworth's tale to speak for itself.|Rotten
BlacKkKlansman slips seamlessly from borderline-absurdist humour to all-too-real horror, conjuring an urgent blend of sociopolitical period satire and contemporary wake-up call.|Fresh
Funny, intelligent and very poignant. One of Spike Lee's best films. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An unsubtle film for unsubtle times, all the better for not backing down with what it's trying to say or how it says it.|Fresh
Audacious, even as it deliberates the obvious parallels between then and now, and how little progress has actually been made, BlackKklansman doubles down as meaningful entertainment.|Fresh
The final moments of the movie are very powerful...This movie is right on time.|Fresh
...a movie that has to be reckoned with, about a subject that we seem doomed -- hopelessly -- to reckon with.|Fresh
[Blackkklansman] feels both empowering and uncomfortably exposing that no-one is absolved from the discordant dissection of cultural identity at play.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is a clever, furious, fiercely intelligent picture, and easily the best thing Spike Lee has done in years.|Fresh
It works brilliantly as a dark comedy; it works as a muscular, historical drama that educates as much as it entertains; it works as a thrilling cop flick. It works, basically.|Fresh
The veteran director brings the full force of his filmmaking knowledge to bear on proceedings, reckoning again and again with the weight of American history and Hollywood's interpretation of it.|Fresh
By trying to stir audiences into righteous indignation about race, Spike Lee fails to include elements that might make his film entertaining - such as plot, character development, romance, action and suspense.|Rotten
A layered, complex and extremely good film.|Fresh
I view it in a longer conversation with the artist...there's a version of this that is incredibly tight and thematically consistent...but this movie is baggy, and it disappointed me...it just hung around, messing with different styles.|Rotten
A brilliant reflection of the deeply embedded racism in America's DNA. BlacKkKlansman shows Lee in top form.|Fresh
Go for entertainment. Learn about human dignity.|Fresh
It is galvanising cinema, made with an urgency and anger that leaps from the screen.|Fresh
But while Lee keeps things entertaining, often even funny, the director of Do the Right Thing knows answers aren't simple.|Fresh
In my opinion, it's one of Lee's best films to date, appealing to all audiences who want a great story.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman's determination to be everything for everybody - comedy/ melodrama, wish-fulfilment fable/awful warning - proves its unexpected, unconventional master-choice.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman blends comic irony and outspoken polemic but still works very effectively as a hardboiled crime drama.|Fresh
"Lee's spot-on, politically prescient serio-comedy BlacKkKlansman shouts it again, ""Wake up!"" but with more urgency, more intensity, more scares and more laughs."|Fresh
Spike Lee roars back to form with his best film in ages.|Fresh
Helming the film it feels like he was born to make, Lee approaches his weighty material with the complexity that it deserves|Fresh
Powerfully, sometimes humorously...encompasses racial , cinematic history...Chilling link between past and present realities. Far more truth in tumultuous film than fiction.|Fresh
The struggle continues, Lee conveys with a satisfying mix of showmanship and social commitment, and there's still a lot of work to be done.|Fresh
Lee's most entertaining and thought-provoking film in years.|Fresh
This film is Lee at his finest. In years to come, we will look at his work and BlacKkKlansman will be up there with his best|Fresh
In BlackKklansman, Lee beautifully re-writes history with thunder, and with Ron's story subverting and destroying the mechanisms of white supremacy from the inside out.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is one of Spike Lee's most accomplished films, one of the best films of 2018 and should make a big splash during the coming award season.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is as entertaining as it is provocative. It's not a polemic. It's a fully-realized film.|Fresh
This is American filmmaking at its best: urgent, angry, innovative, loud and funny.|Fresh
Spike Lee at his fiery best.|Fresh
Even the spelling of the film's title highlights the taboo subject and drags its ugliness into the light, calling attention to past and current racism while marginalizing the racists... and nothing scares them more than that.|Fresh
Spike Lee isn't subtle, his is a sledgehammer approach. But being delicate wasn't the point. This is a film that needs to be seen.|Fresh
While it is a pity that the story wasn't told with more visual finesse, this is trivial compared to our real-world problems. It takes a good movie to put that into perspective.|Fresh
Here, as in 25th Hour, Lee often deviates from the plot. However, the difference is that here the appendices underline what the movie transmits... to remind us that behind the film there is a Message, with a capital letter. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
One of the best movies I've seen all year.|Fresh
It really made me laugh, but for some moments I was tearing up because I could relate so much.|Fresh
I felt that despite the patches of wobbliness and pomposity in BlacKkKlansman, the film was well worth my time for the sake of that shocking leap into a reality so rotten that spoiler alerts are neither necessary nor possible.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman benefits from a solid cast and a script... that has a good mixture of comedic and dramatic moments that keep the movie from dragging despite its 2-hour-plus run time.|Fresh
Lee's motivating anger produces a unique, electrifying charge.|Fresh
Cluttered and awkward.|Rotten
D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation is a great film. BlacKkKlansman is a good film.|Fresh
The vibe is authentic, the period detail tasty, yet BlacKkKlansman burns with contemporary anger and concludes on an impossibly affecting, painfully relevant note.|Fresh
Spike Lee's best in years. Sharp, funny, timely and powerful with superb performances .|Fresh
Lee keeps the film, and the audience, on its toes. A laugh is followed by a fright or the chill of recognition.|Fresh
Ultimately, BlacKkKlansman is a carefully thought out provocation, a film that knows it will both make you laugh but also leave you reeling.|Fresh
It's entertaining and angrily thought-provoking, with Lee at the top of his game - even if he can't stay off the soapbox and piles on too many endings.|Fresh
BlackKklansman is a slapstick comedy, a blaxsploitation throwback and an incendiary Molotov cocktail thrown into the foray of the modern multiplex. The most urgent, clear-voiced and, arguably, best of the outspoken filmmaker's recent output|Fresh
Not the tightest endeavor from Lee, but it does showcase rare directorial discipline from the helmer, who's making sure his message is present in the midst of all the undercover cop maneuvering.|Fresh
Some viewers may feel that Lee is being didactic, or literal, but I think that BlacKkKlansman is a vital film arriving at a critical moment.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman entertains, all right, but it holds the audience accountable, too.|Fresh
The Lee touches are there, yes, but missing from BlackKklansman is the temerity to touch the live wire, the feeling of dangerous imperative. He has found a remarkable subject, but only skimmed its surface.|Rotten
A film of deceptively outspoken contemporary relevance, this is cinema at its most alert, alarming and alive.|Fresh
The tone of this movie is interesting -- the stakes are both dramatic and high, but it's balanced with a lot of fun, tongue and cheek dialogue.|Fresh
Lee refuses to let us close our eyes or fake blindness. Even more so, he's using the period setting as an obvious reflection on the current state of race relations, which is not all that different today than it was in the 1970s.|Fresh
Spike Lee is both a biographer and interrogator, infiltrating confederate belief systems that perpetuate American myths and how they endure in our culture.|Fresh
[BlacKkKlansman] contains both comic aspects and references to buddy movies, but its power derives from the way they are interwoven with a broad sweep of thematic and emotional elements Lee introduces, for the most part successfully.|Fresh
"Go see ""BlacKkKlansman"" because you'll get a smartly entertaining mainstream film that also packs a provocative commentary on America past and present."|Fresh
Lee's latest is a rollercoaster that is laugh-out-loud when it isn't shocking you into stunned silence.|Fresh
Even as he is careening from one extreme to the next, Lee is able to ratchet up the tension and release it in hilariously satisfying ways, never quite letting anyone off the hook. Nobody in the film achieves anything that looks like a real victory.|Fresh
The film may be flawed, but its message is not.|Fresh
Lee has the nerve and the knowledge to bring laughter to this thorny and often revolting true story. And he proves from the opening moments that he still knows how to make our laughter curl up and die in our throats.|Fresh
One of Lee's most thoroughly entertaining works. The cast and the crisp dialogue fire with purpose.|Fresh
There are moments that feel comical, some horrific, and some downright inspiring but the tonal shifts hardly matter as the end results come to a film that's perfect for this time.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is pretty enjoyable as a low-key police procedural, but its primary function is to put a comic bull's-eye on the backside of white supremacy.|Fresh
... a fascinating and intense depiction of a too-fantastic-for-fiction story of a black police detective infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan.|Fresh
"""BlacKkKlansman"" is sloppy and a bit all-over-the-place, but it is also a film that needs to be seen, made by an auteur who deserves- no, demands - that his voice is heard."|Fresh
An entertaining jaunt through the '70s, with some dutiful grappling over the enduring question of race in America thrown in...|Fresh
...a straight up, fierce, political polemical from an acknowledged master of the form, who has not and will not run out of reasons to be justifiably angry.|Fresh
"Powerful and pertinent, ""Blackkklansman"" is a film that deals with both the past and the present."|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is both bitingly funny and stunningly effective as a call to arms.|Fresh
It feels heavy-handed at times, but there's no denying its power. Spike Lee is telling us something we need to hear.|Fresh
BlacKKlansman dances smoothly between being funny, poignant, heartbreaking, scary, and beautiful. BlacKkKlansman is the movie America needs, all people need - for it is a movie for all people.|Fresh
The savagery that Lee is capable of shaved down for a demographic that aren't accustomed to the evolving, bold electricity of Do the Right Thing or Bamboozled and instead in many ways resembles something closer to a Saturday Night Live sketch.|Rotten
Tense and timely, it's cleverly constructed and visually cathartic.|Fresh
BLACKkKLANSMAN lulls you with its satire of American race relations, only to slap you awake at the end of the third act with a montage of grotesqueries from the past couple of years-lest we forget Ferguson and Charlottesville.|Fresh
Lee isn't overbearing about portraying the KKK cell as fools, though not subtle either.The movie veers between the entertainingly campy and preachy.|Fresh
Topher Grace plays David Duke as an upwardly mobile nincompoop in a cheap three-piece suit, pathetic in his lunatic convictions but -- as we saw in Charlottesville last year -- still a force for social chaos.|Fresh
Spike Lee's film is one of the years best; Ron Stallworth's memoir is told with passion & admiration-aptly Lee's finale reminds us of our current gut-wrenching racial tensions.|Fresh
What should be a devastating strike becomes more of a glancing blow.|Fresh
A real life Mod Squad with a grindhouse soundtrack and the most relevant film of the year.|Fresh
Disappointingly erratic and rarely engrossing...|Rotten
Lee has delivered his best commercial film since Inside Man. Not only is it powerful, character-driven with social commentary and politics, but it also has romance and comedy that makes it a pleasurable experience to watch.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is urgent and vital. It stands next to Do the Right Thing as one of the best movies ever made about racial intolerance in the United States.|Fresh
"""BlacKkKlansman"" is a hopeful tome that, if we could defeat racist hatred back then, we can do it again. Now, though, it is a bigger job and involves us all."|Fresh
This is one of his best films because he marries the anger and intensity with the restraint and poetry that he's so good at visually.|Fresh
Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman veers wildly between hilarious and harrowing, thrilling and appalling, smart and stylish.|Fresh
Lee's genius, though, is that it's as entertaining a film as it is worthy.|Fresh
Spike is contained by a true story, and being contained allows him to focus.|Fresh
"A masterful tension of ""I'm going to make you laugh, and I'm also going to make you feel really weird and uneasy""."|Fresh
The movie is smart, funny, and insightful.|Fresh
It's a movie as timely as it is provocative and amazingly, for much of its running time, it is weirdly funny.|Fresh
Not since Bamboozled has a Spike Lee joint been this blunt and tightly rolled.|Fresh
Piercing and poetic, BlacKkKlansman is perhaps best understood as an evolution of Baldwin's work, with Lee wearing the crown as one of the writer's most worthy successors.|Fresh
Lee's wild tonal shifts made his work seem scattershot and unfocused, and it's not that he tamps that down here. But now, the itchiness, gallows humor, and howls of rage just feel like everyday life. Reality has finally become a Spike Lee joint.|Fresh
Lee shapes his adaptation with a certain frenetic energy, eschewing traditional historical tics and instead leapfrogging across genres... The effect of his genre-swapping is as dizzying as it is immensely satisfying.|Fresh
Spike's back, so back. BlacKkKlansman​ is a brilliant satire, a trenchant political statement and a love/hate letter to America, warts and all. It's a comedy and tragedy balled together, the bitterness as pungent as the sweetness.|Fresh
Just as Lee reminds us of his talent and the way it's been overlooked, he also reminds us of what he's been trying to tell us about American racism. Malcolm X was Lee's rainbow sign. BlacKkKlansman is the fire this time.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman has everything anyone would want from a cop movie, but its candid treatment of its subject matter and the conversation it might inspire are the telegram that audiences deserve.|Fresh
... Lee goes the extra mile to provide us a funny and complex portrait of the 1970s, which is very reflective of today's society. It will entertain, educate, inspire and remind you to stay awake.|Fresh
Not least of Klansman's virtues is its resurrection of Mr. Lee's terrific gift for storytelling.|Fresh
Veering from a blaxploitation spoof to an undercover thriller and ending with a no-punches-pulled real-life coda, BlacKkKlansman is riotously fun one minute, savagely biting the next.|Fresh
Lee heightens the nervy tone with strong visuals, juxtaposing a '70s blaxploitation aesthetic with the Klan's suffocating suburban décor. The jumps keeps you off balance, and engaged.|Fresh
This is intended as a comedy, albeit one of an extremely uncomfortable kind where the depiction of the past is a direct and shocking reflection upon the right here and damn now.|Fresh
The movie's not perfect, but it sticks the landing of its message. It was engaging - thrilling at times - and I personally thought it was a great time.|Fresh
Lee's film about Stallworth & Flip taking on Duke and the KKK is akin to the Keystone Kops taking on the Three Stooges...unfortunately, Lee's polemic-ism eschews comedy and portrays their bungling efforts as heroic, which is hard to buy.|Rotten
A hugely entertaining film that contains a number of huge laughs, a surprisingly effective amount of suspense and thrills, a number of strong performances and enough points of provocation to inspire plenty of post-film discussions.|Fresh
Lee's overarching point... is that we have not come very far at all from the early 1970s. His aesthetic in BlacKkKlansman is that, in making of movies that matter, we have moved beyond the niceties of normal dramatic strategies.|Fresh
Lots of language in Lee's fact-based dark comedy.|Fresh
This freewheeling account of an African-American cop who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1970s is problematic as narrative drama, but stunning as provocation.|Fresh
"Even though it sings with the funky energy of the 1970s, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is absolutely current. Among all the movies that have become supercharged by the terror of our modern times, it's arguably the most essential yet."|Fresh
The cumulative effect is like a bracing cold shower, a reminder that the fight is far from over.|Fresh
"While ""BlacKkKlansman"" has all the pleasures of a '70s genre film, recalling ""Serpico"" or ""The French Connection,"" Lee wants to rattle us as well as entertain us, sounding the alarm about the present-day parallels to today's worrisome world."|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is an incendiary return to form for Lee, who not only pulls no punches, he adds plenty of haymakers into the mix.|Fresh
Through humor, violence, and drama,'BlacKkKlansman'paints a line of white supremacy from the Civil War to Charlottesville rallies last year.|Fresh

With Stallworth's remarkable true and timely story and Washington's star-making performance, one of Lee's all-time best, most purely entertaining, and most important films.|Fresh
It's rare that a movie is both this fun yet simultaneously elicits flat-out rage. If at times some of the KKK's actions feel overblown and exaggerated, the present day footage at the back end of the film will shut you right up.|Fresh
Lee has always chosen topics rooted in truth and steadfastly spoken out via his films about social justice and the need for change. And BLACKkKLANSMAN is as good as he gets.|Fresh
This stunningly powerful indictment of racism in America should be remembered as one of the best films of this --- or any other year.|Fresh
Snuggly wrapped in a ball of political half-humor and cautionary relevance, BlacKkKlansman packs a blunt wallop alongside its C-4 explosives and cross burnings, which Spike Lee reminds us are a bit more dimensional than a page in a history book.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman captures the absurd aspects of this story, while still drawing parallels that make the movie feel urgent and dishearteningly relevant. For that reason, it's among Lee's best films in some time.|Fresh
Even the comedic bits absolutely pop and sing, as you can tell Lee's invigorated by the material, and totally invested in letting the audience explore just how audacious the tale he's telling truly is.|Fresh
Lee again puts the pedal to the metal in trying to acknowledge an ugly part of American life that shouldn't be swept under any red, white and blue rug -- then or now.|Fresh

Invites the audience into a complex and impassioned conversation about the power of racism - and the moving image - to influence our lives.|Fresh
Spike Lee is an audacious filmmaker who crosses boundaries and deliberately blurs drama and reality. Never has this been more effective than in BlacKkKlansman, which defies a number of rules and offers a punch in the gut instead.|Fresh
For those who are interested in the history of police procedure, politics and social injustice, BlacKkKlansman is a must-see.|Fresh
There's serious tension in BlackkKlansman's situation, and the film embraces the shifts in mood with shifts in filmmaking style that allow Lee to couch his arguments in a kind of shorthand history of Hollywood's treatment of race.|Fresh
Spike Lee effortlessly blends narrative and analysis with BlacKkKlansman.|Fresh
Lee has once again cleverly flexed his genre-bending muscles. Much as he did with 2015's underrated farcical/musical whatzit Chi-Raq, the director melds comedy and tragedy to come up with entertaining and thought-provoking cinema.|Fresh

Lee bludgeons us quite effectively.|Fresh
It's a solid work, albeit one that's flawed in the same ways that nearly all of Spike's best films are flawed.|Fresh

BlacKkKlansman uses history to illustrate how we're repeating it.|Fresh
Set in the late 1970s but informed by the here and now, it's fuelled by righteous anger against racial hatred and anti-Semitism, leavened by scathing wit.|Fresh
This is pure Lee, at times both scathingly satirical and trenchantly earnest...[but] Lee has become a master director who has forgotten how to tell a story.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is one of Spike Lee's most accomplished films in recent memory, and one of the best films of 2018.|Fresh
There's a lot going on here, and Lee massages it all into a powerful film that can be appreciated by blacks and whites, men and women, young and old alike.|Fresh
BlackKklansmen is messy and conflicted in that way, working through its own identity crisis, not necessarily on purpose, but the result is fitting. The film wavers in its attempts to entertain and provoke; to make light or go hard.|Fresh
[It's] a film that deftly melds wit and social commentary, compounded by a horrifying end crescendo that's impossible to look away from, and stays with you long after you've left the theater.|Fresh
Spike Lee's best movie since 'Inside Man'.|Fresh
Spike Lee using his white voice - for subversive purposes.|Fresh

This is a big movie from Lee, warm and smart. It's not essentially radical, unless the subject of self-defense is radical.|Fresh
Rhetorical excess is another feature of Lee's filmmaking, and this movie is no exception... These are negligible flaws, though, compared with the superb ensemble acting, another hallmark of Lee's filmmaking.|Fresh

The title promises something of a biography, but I left the movie wanting to know more about Stallworth. We know what he did, but getting a deeper read on the man proves elusive.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is largely comedy, but even in the movie's most dramatic stretches, Lee robs the Klan and its many costumed peers of their mystical designs. The horrors are real. The politics are farce.|Fresh
Its fiery message couldn't be more timely - and its rage more justified.|Fresh
Lee wants to explain how images in popular culture have social and political consequences-a vital message.|Fresh
Lee's intent doesn't take away from the craftsmanship of his direction and the convincing tonal shifts that make BlacKkKlansman pivot from intriguing crime caper to biting contemporary satire so fluidly.|Fresh

It is an exhilarating, distressing, funny and profound film, with one of the more memorable film scores in years, from composer Terence Blanchard... It's a Spike Lee joint that is not to be missed.|Fresh

Structurally flawed, conceptually challenged and tonally troubled.|Rotten

Spike Lee's seriously sensational film not only made me laugh but also left me with chills on the hottest day of the year.|Fresh
[Lee] is firing on all cylinders here. BlacKkKlansman is a true conversation starter, and probably a conversation ender as well.|Fresh
"Headlined by a rapturous performance by John David Washington, and a crackling script full of laughs and deeply moving moments, ""BlackKklansman"" sizzles every moment on the screen."|Fresh

"BlacKkKlansman wades into the same comic-horror-suspense territory that ""Get Out"" so brilliantly explores."|Fresh

[Lee] is not only still on fire but has found a story that allows him to be as excited and involved as he was when it all began.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman is as imperfect and wandering as almost all of Lee's great movies but made with their same intense passion; this is a filmmaker who always matches the emotion of the occasion.|Fresh

The resounding indictment -- of both the left and right alike -- is unmistakable.|Fresh
I haven't read Stallworth's book, so I don't know precisely how much of Lee's movie is fact versus dramatization, but I do know that the movie is absolutely terrific.|Fresh
"Lee says that his hope is to ""shake people from their slumber"" and he achieves this with his entertaining, ultimately shocking film."|Fresh
A remarkable blend of rage and humor makes BlacKkKlansman at once both a necessary and timeless experience. It will shock most, offend some, but most importantly will spark conversation among all.|Fresh

This could well be a commercial success. It's a blockbuster of an American film and it was much needed...|Fresh
Spike Lee styles the film as a popular entertainment, forgoing the theatrical satire typical of his late-period state-of-the-nation joints, like Bamboozled and Chi-Raq, and settling into the accessible rhythms of the contemporary sitcom.|Fresh
Lee acknowledges the power of cinema as a political tool - the KKK have Birth of a Nation to thank, while Ron and his activist girlfriend list off blaxploitation icons - and here he's engineered a rallying cry to an inert American populus.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman seldom ever channels that rage. Instead we are presented with a perfectly decent comedy that will be accessible enough for a wide mainstream audience. Fair enough.|Fresh
You are never in any doubt that you are watching a 2018 movie that is less interested in the past for its own sake than for what it can tell us about our current American moment.|Fresh

BlacKkKlansman, is quintessential Spike Lee, impassioned and messy and vital as anything he's done in decades.|Fresh

The film could easily have been a fun escapade but the director throughout makes comments on the present day American political divide with ironic jokes.|Fresh

Spike Lee hits his targets effectively enough - again and again. They keep popping back up like the targets in a fairground shooting gallery, and get shot back down again with a clang.|Fresh
Lee never takes his eye off the connecting thread between the events of 1978 and the present. The result is one of his most flat-out entertaining films in years, and also one of his most uncompromising.|Fresh
As much a compelling black empowerment story as it is an electrifying commentary on the problems of African-American representation across more than a century of cinema.|Fresh
BlacKkKlansman's joke is an indictment of complacency, particularly that of white liberals who'd rather not confront the distressing fact that not much has changed in 40 years, beyond a re-styling of old, old ideology.|Fresh
