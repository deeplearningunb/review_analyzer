This is not a film to be taken lightly. In fact, it could be triggering for children of divorce and anyone who has experienced domestic abuse.|Fresh
A devastating, authentic portrait of divorce and obsession, writer/director Xavier Legrand's debut feature is a stunner.|Fresh
It's a gripping, difficult story that induces some serious claustrophobia.|Fresh
Legrand's debut is not easy to watch; but the powerful performances, suspenseful story, and exquisitely calibrated direction make it a must-see.|Fresh
A peerless fusing of dumbshow performance and background sound editing, there's a rising panic that allows the final, violent closing act to seem shockingly organic.|Fresh
While the performances in Custody are all strong, relative newcomer Thomas Gioria runs away with the movie.|Fresh
Unbearably tense throughout.|Fresh
It gets to you in unexpected ways in capturing the fear of being in the presence of a human time bomb capable of detonating at the slightest provocation.|Fresh

Xavier Legrand's award winning domestic abuse drama holds the viewer in its powerful grip.|Fresh
Legrand is masterful escalating anxiety.|Fresh
Custody embodies the essence of harrowing drama in its pure, distilled, un-contrived form.|Fresh
That said, while the story is somewhat clunky, the three stars - Lea Drucker, Denis Menochet and young Thomas Gloria - are all terrific in their complex roles.|Fresh
Xavier Legrand's flawless feature debut morphs into a meticulously premeditated nightmare in its final act.|Fresh
Custody has moments of true power and realism but spends a great deal of time bouncing Julien back and forth between his parents. Structurally, things become a bit repetitive and ultimately tiresome.|Rotten
Unsurprising, but still harrowing|Fresh
Less nuanced than some of its predecessors but far more stressful, it isn't an easy watch -- nor is it meant to be.|Fresh
Emotionally bruising but not without some glimmer of hope.|Fresh
Did I mention this movie isn't for the weakhearted?|Fresh
Supremely crafted and performed contemporary French thriller about a broken marriage and ensuing custody battle is a gripping, edge-of-seat drama that never lets up.|Fresh
It's a curious dichotomy that impresses on a directorial level even as it hedges on a psychological one.|Fresh
Custody battles often ends in compromises solutions but the couple in this film are out to do royal battle, the woman claiming her right to 100% custody.|Fresh
Custody is concerned with the failure of process to discern human need and perversion, and Xavier Legrand rather ironically follows in the footsteps of bureaucracy by reducing people to statistics.|Rotten
Writer-director Xavier Legrand knows how to do family court.|Fresh
Buried amid a week of non-inspiring film releases, this French gem is well worth ferreting out.|Fresh
With each of the protagonist's explosions of fury before almost every conflict that presents itself, the film is taking the form of a psychological thriller to get fully into territory worthy of horror movies... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Certain] dramatic mechanisms limit the reflective force, the discursive complexity and the artistic value of [Xavier] Legrand's work. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Slowly but surely it becomes a sort of portait, almost in documentary form, of the difficulties and hardships of divorce... similar to the most intense, but realistic, horror movie. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Xavier Legrand has an envious pulse and a promising future as he creates a complex present that appears to be narrated so simply. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
There is a masterful handling of these dramatic mechanisms to tell this overwhelming horror story. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

It impresses how [director Xavier] Legrand spins the unbearable growing tension... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A model thriller, with some of the most powerful tension in recent cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The way it escalates the anxiety and threat at the heart of the story could teach genre filmmakers a thing or two about building tension in gut-clenching ways.|Fresh
A story that unfolds through a series of perspective-shifting encounters. It's often painful to watch, building to a confrontation that leaves us deeply shaken.|Fresh
It's not a unique story but it is very well told and quintessentially modern European in style.|Fresh
It's well acted (not least by Thomas Gioria as the child), but unenlightening.|Fresh
Legrand's film, which is shot tight and gives you no room to breathe or look away, initially keeps you guessing about who you ought to be siding with.|Fresh
During its promising initial 15 minutes, the first feature film by Xavier Legrand suggests that what will come next will be a weighty reflection on a legal issue as complex as the one identified in its title. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Legrand builds suspense without any soundtrack or clever camera tricks, instead shooting Custody with an almost merciless documentary-style flatness.|Fresh
French cinema may have found a new auteur.|Fresh
For all its stripped-bare economy and unsentimentality, this is one of the most emotionally devastating cinema experiences of the past year.|Fresh
Human beings aren't always straight with each other. With thrilling skill, Legrand and his team find a crooked path to clarity.|Fresh
Dispensing with a score and using ambient sound to ratchet up the tension, this is an object lesson in stylistic restraint that only misses its step during the nerve-shredding denouement.|Fresh
Custody starts quietly but by the end you will be holding your breath and perched on the very edge of your seat.|Fresh
Claustrophobic and brutal, [Custody] is an impressive debut and heralds Legrand as a major talent to watch.|Fresh
The stand-out performance, amid lots of exceptionally fine acting, is by young Gioria.|Fresh
The suspense builds, but apart from the final moments perhaps, which are pure Stephen King, it is never melodramatic.|Fresh
The subject matter won't be to everyone's taste, but for more adventurous viewers this is something to be savoured, if not always comfortably.|Fresh
Transforms a straightforward story of domestic violence into something like a horror movie, and it's so harrowing and so incredibly tense that I'm not sure that it's not exploitive.|Rotten
The film could hardly be more timely or disconcerting. But it understands the ignition point of rage - not just its ugly momentum.|Fresh
It's rare to see such suspense come from everyday activities; each scene is infused with a sense of potential dread.|Fresh
Custody has the severe integrity of a picture by Ken Loach or the Dardenne brothers. But there's no denying Legrand's gift for building tension.|Fresh
There is not much storytelling light and shade in Custody: but it has the shock and swipe of real life.|Fresh
It is by no means an easy watch, but Custody is intensely gripping.|Fresh
This is a chilling and well observed study of domestic violence that seems all the more powerful because of its director's slow-burning approach.|Fresh
Judge not - yet here we are in the scalding French drama Custody, observing the legal endgame of a painful divorce from the perspective of the bench.|Fresh
An accomplished debut, with chilling performances from the two leads.|Fresh
A father-son drama for anyone who finds There Will Be Blood too cosy in its depiction of paternal love.|Fresh
Compelling, and beautifully realised. This is an astounding film, with outstanding performances from its cast under the assured hand of Legrand. A must-see.|Fresh
Custody is an impressive debut feature from Xavier Legrand, that manages to avoid exploitation even as it generates untold amounts of tension from a realistic domestic drama.|Fresh
Legrand has created an utterly painful, yet also thoroughly believable, tale of family disintegration.|Fresh
Custody is often profoundly distressing but that's precisely the point.|Fresh
Xavier Legrand generates an astonishing amount of tension, and when Custody explodes into rages, it's likely your stomach will clench up with anxiety.|Fresh
A beautiful piece of slow cinema that really brings the audience close to its subject, Chosen (Custody Of The Eyes) presents the religious life as a true vocation in the best sense of the word.|Fresh
A film that borrows something from the Dardenne brothers and manages to raise the tension in just an hour and a half of a domestic violence story that seems so common. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
While in places you can see the film Legrand is trying to make-a domestic mosaic of sorts-in the end, Custody comes off as far too formulaic and vague.|Fresh
"""Custody"" makes vivid and visceral the escalating, suffocating terror of domestic abuse (even after the end of the relationship) in a way few films have managed."|Fresh
Custody doesn't begin to morph into an astonishingly captivating piece of work until it progresses into its mesmerizing third act...|Fresh
One hell of a calling card, and perhaps the most dazzling fusion of grim social realism and giddy genre thrills since Cristian Mungiu's 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days.|Fresh
With Custody, [Director Xavier] Legrand has created a family drama that plays out as social realism, but it is as intense as a thriller and, with no generic get outs, far more terrifying than Kubrick's The Shining.|Fresh
This is the arrival of a major talent, and a hell of a movie.|Fresh
We want to know more, but the film never delivers.|Fresh
The film may resonate for anyone who's grown up under the unhealthy supervision of a mean bastard. Take that as a sobering recommendation.|Fresh
Legrand operates in the raw social realist tradition of such auteurs as Maurice Pialat and the Dardenne brothers, stripping away sentimentality in favor of direct, observational filmmaking.|Fresh
The intensity is too much to bear in the best possible way. Legrand knows exactly where to position his characters and what's necessary to break them.|Fresh
[Custody] suffers from an all-too-familiar conclusion.|Rotten
Though a short film, even one of half-an-hour as Legrand's was, can be carried almost solely on this sort of tension, a feature needs something more.|Rotten
An almost unbearably-tense, no-holds-barred drive through the nightmare of domestic terrorism, Custody is a can't-look-away hybrid of gruelling reality and heightened cinematic technique.|Fresh
Confidently assembled and acted with impressive precision, this striking debut feature finally doesn't fully convince psychologically but is nonetheless a more than solid calling card for Legrand.|Fresh
