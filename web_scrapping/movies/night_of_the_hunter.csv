One of the great movie horror tales, with one of the greatest of all movie villains.|Fresh
It is a garish, unbelievable but fairly exciting nightmare.|Fresh
Ultimately the source of its style and power is mysterious -- it is a film without precedents, and without any real equals|Fresh
This start for Gregory as producer and Laughton as director is rich in promise but the completed product, bewitching at times, loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect.|Rotten
All this has been crisply compacted into clear screen drama by the late James Agee and it is put forth under the direction of Mr. Laughton in stark, rigid visual terms.|Fresh

This southern American Gothic chiller remains both gloriously cinematic and utterly terrifying almost 60 years after it was made.|Fresh
Mitchum is magnetic.|Fresh
This thriller is one of the great masterpieces of American cinema, a movie so strangely repellent, so poetic and so utterly hypnotic that it sadly never found an audience.|Fresh
