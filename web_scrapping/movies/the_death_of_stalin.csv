This is black humor at its blackest and best. It shoots a taproot down to our deepest humanity, and it does so, ironically enough, by revealing the hellish sources of our own inhumanity.|Fresh
Already the premier political satirist of his era, Armando Iannucci pulls off his most impressive feat yet, turning the corpse-strewn power struggle that followed Joseph Stalin's sudden death into a lacerating and disturbingly relevant farce.|Fresh
I love political satire as much as anyone, but this film is insufferable with its back-slapping, elitist brand of supposed humor.|Rotten
This film plays like a chess game where everyone wants to the throne, and only the most cunning will survive.|Fresh
Is there a more thrillingly inventive political satirist than Armando Iannucci? I doubt it.|Fresh
Paralysed by fear, the right answer now the wrong answer; the Soviet Politburo sounds a lot like Twitter. Moving from panic to farce and biting one-liners, it's crammed with sharp performances (though Isaacs steals the show as Yorkshire's General Zhukov).|Fresh
Stalin serves up the cringe comedy of tyranny, where much of the humor lies in the way that the characters twist themselves into hopeless knots as they navigate a Soviet wonderland.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is one of the funniest, most absurdly dark and frighteningly relevant political satires I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.|Fresh

The Death of Stalin is one of the funniest, most absurdly dark and frighteningly relevant political satires I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.|Fresh
... an astonishing exercise in tone management, as it alternates from violent political fatalism to absurdist satirical comedy...|Fresh
Naturally, what happened behind the scenes after Stalin's death is murky and Iannucci approaches it coldly, making The Death of Stalin a satire as funny as it is dark. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Iannucci is a born narrator for political comedy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Death of Stalin has atypical humor and is lethal in its agile and sharp dialogue. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The perfect blend of black humor, The Death of Stalin has a very real message about the political world today.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin isn't about Stalin or what happened in 1953. Instead it's about the dark side of power and those who execute it. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is rarely out-and-out hilarious, but the performances are top-notch and the writing is thoroughly witty, entertaining, and thought-provoking.|Fresh
No joke is without a later payoff that mixes two or more things we've already laughed at together for another when you least expect it.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is not only unexpected, but sharp, witty, and effectively spurious.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is a smart, quick-witted, and amusing comedy that pinpoints historical humor.|Fresh
In Iannucci's scathing satire, Stalin may have died but his punishingly inhuman legacy lives on.|Fresh
"...as great as the ensemble is, the script is even better, easily making ""The Death of Stalin"" the best and funniest film of 2018 thus far."|Fresh
The comedic timing is impeccable throughout, with no weak links.|Fresh
This queasy-funny mixture of alarm and panic with bleakness and horror underscores our desire for something nasty to happen in the halls of power.|Fresh
This dark comedy includes scenes of kidnapping, torture, murder, and a kind of autopsy scene where Stalin's brain is removed from his skull, yet it remains, essentially a comedy. Comedy is serious business.|Fresh
If only the real world was, in fact, this tame in its political nonsense.|Fresh
...in an era where villainy does in fact seem to keep prevailing, it's satisfying to watch them stumble and scramble for our amusement, if only for a while.|Fresh
Directed and co-written by Armando Iannucci (of In the Loop and Veep fame), the film incorporates farce, wordplay, sight gags, and satire into one hilarious Molotov cocktail.|Fresh
The movie veers into slapstick territory at times, as Iannucci continually takes the spark of a true story and sets it on comic fire.|Fresh
This film's grave, absurd, brilliant, and brutal historical context has a way of making the future look, if not hopeful, then at least familiar.|Fresh
An incredibly funny film about a not-very-funny historical event.|Fresh
a ruthless livewire comedy... It tempts and teases the rigidly ideological portions of our minds to step into the light and laugh.|Fresh
I only wish the (functional) realization was at the level of its (dazzling) performers. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Iannucci is at it again in his usual uproarious fashion, slinging gags like weapons and flinging devastating one-liners like Molotov cocktails.|Fresh
It's a gamble that pays off handsomely-this is far and away the funniest film of the year so far.|Fresh
Iannucci takes some historical liberties, da, and super-compresses all the post-Stalin angling for power... But the reverse-courses, doublespeak, and obfuscations are 1984-ish dystopia-politics at their bitter best.|Fresh
As I say, the movie has its moments. Just way fewer than expected and than many reviewers have promised.|Fresh
Even those turned off by the very thought of watching anything political at this point in time will find themselves caught up in this clever political farce.|Fresh
Comedy as dark as it gets, but a great cast and crew produce the laughs.|Fresh
Nobody does mordant political vaudeville like Armando Iannucci. His touch is swift, sure and utterly poisonous.|Fresh
The film manages to be both scabrously funny and bone chilling as it nails Stalinism's absurdity and inhumanity.|Fresh
Rousing slapstick political-comedy.|Fresh
The funniest, smartest, most unforgiving comedy in years, and the best satiric film of the 2010s.|Fresh
A world gone mad, shaped from fear, chaos, cronyism,toadyism and limitless corruption. It's not the present day.|Fresh
It may be savagely satirical but it's not very funny.|Rotten
A devastatingly funny dissection of power politics, stripping the mystique from it and those who worship it. Iannucci has done it again.|Fresh
Comedy is not the obvious genre for dealing with a brutal autocrat who killed millions of his own people, but The Death of Stalin mostly works.|Fresh
Maybe the movie doesn't live up to the most lavish praise that's been heaped on it, but there's a certain grim pleasure to be had from seeing its knaves and fools stripped down to their essential, vulgar meanness...|Fresh
[We] laugh, and we get why we laugh, but everything about the humour is painfully uncomfortable.|Fresh
Although it would be facile to compare modern politics to the horrors of Stalin's purge, there is something queasily resonant about a movie depicting a country on the verge of a nervous breakdown.|Fresh
[Steve] Buscemi is just brilliant as pragmatic Khrushchev.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is signature Iannucci - absurd set-ups leading to even more outrageous ends via the spitefully delicious cadence of his dialogue.|Fresh
Iannucci's fondness for chat does overwhelm certain scenes, but this is still ruthlessly funny, if not quite knockabout hilarious, which makes you wonder if something more subversive and satirical is going on.|Fresh
In The Death of Stalin, you will find a political comedy so dark, the punchlines are all but blacked out. So be warned: while there is much to admire here, you may find little to be amused by.|Fresh
"""Buscemi leads the cast valiantly in what are sharp comedic performances all around, guided by Iannucci's most savage political satire to date."""|Fresh
Enormously witty dialogue ... the finest of ensembles, headed by Steve Buscemi, in the performance his entire career has been leading to ... something of a satirical masterpiece, and a bloody good history lesson to boot!|Fresh
The Death of Stalin overcomes several obstacles to prove that it is both funny and cinematic.|Fresh
Tales of the venal, the selfish, and the desperate, lurking--when not preening--in the halls of power.|Fresh
Kind of like Veep with a hammer and sickle, smart, tart and daftly topical.|Fresh
[Armando] Iannucci goes out of his way to really push the envelope to create some super memorable caricatures from living memory.|Fresh
If satire is dying, then The Death of Stalin, the latest film from Scottish writer-director Armando Iannucci, is a defibrillator, shocking the genre back to life.|Fresh
Death is the liveliest movie about brutal oppression I've seen in a while (since 1995's Underground, anyway); it's funny as hell - then suddenly chilling - and it's more audacious than just about anything else playing now.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is obviously a farce, in the best sense; the primary aim is never verisimilitude. The film shares something of the attitude and atmosphere that pervades a work like Dario Fo's.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin manages to capture and contain a multitude of perspectives and players, both large and small, in its frames, while never losing sight of the very serious historic notes.|Fresh
Don't believe the hype. A far more intriguing, follow the money power struggle off screen instead, pitting corporate interests against the mass popular discontent of the downwardly mobile US population in progress. In other words, who funded your movie.|Rotten
"""Veep"" creator Armando Iannucci and his remarkably comedic cast produce some very big laughs, particularly in the early going."|Fresh
Iannucci made the bravura decision to make a factual film of that event dressed in the black robe of English satire at its darkest. Surely, there was no other intelligent way to bring the story to an audience 75 years after the event.|Fresh
If you like your movies black, thought provoking and hilariously funny, you will adore this audacious, irreverent satire that delves deep into the bowels of Russian politics and picks off scabs.|Fresh
While much of this is certainly hilarious, there are also scenes that drag.|Fresh
The performances from Buscemi and Tambor have to be rated for their comic timing more than for historical nuance, and of the group, Beale stands out the most as he feels the walls of conspiracy closing in.|Fresh
It's cutting-edge political satire worthy of Russian dramatists Gogol or Bulgakov - farcical and frightening. Throat-cutting edge, you might say.|Fresh
A timely satire for those moviegoers who are fine with taking the film at face value - as a silly ribbing of government corruption - and those who find comfort in comparing the nonsense on screen to America's own political reality show.|Fresh
Iannucci hits these Communists so hard, so often you'll wish he'd let up a little on these murderous comrades.|Fresh
...offers the chance to observe a world ruled by absurdity from a safe distance...|Fresh
Once again, if you know how Iannucci works, you can expect Stalin to be as hilariously foul-mouthed as his previous works.|Fresh
I can't think of another movie exactly like The Death of Stalin, which is part of the reason this movie feels so unsettlingly original.|Fresh
If the mixture of brutality and wackiness doesn't always gel, Iannucci earns points for audacity alone. Any movie that's been banned in Putin's Russia is worth seeing,|Fresh
Like the '60s British political comedies it resembles, The Death of Stalin may be too clever, too mordant. But it does have tang, Tom Stoppard-like wordplay and some big and surprising laughs.|Fresh
For Iannucci, who loves to mock the craven, unprincipled pursuit of power, the scenario is an antic delight and plays to his talent for hectic plot turns and (pardon the expression) rapid-fire dialogue.|Fresh
What better material to employ so many fine comic actors, masters all of the anxious flutter, the pained smirk and the deftly parried bon mot? You don't need to know a lot about mid-century Soviet politics to thoroughly enjoy this film|Fresh
Blend The West Wing with Fawlty Towers and add a smidge of Dr. Strangelove, and you're getting close to the feel of The Death of Stalin.|Fresh
The hint that he and the writers are dropping is that if we can guffaw at these monsters, we can deal with anything. See The Death of Stalin and face the future unafraid.|Fresh
They sit around kibitzing and laughing, with one eye on Stalin to ensure that they haven't crossed some line that will have them and their families shot at dawn.|Fresh
This is a film about monsters, yet Iannuci successfully turns these monsters into the pathetic miscreants they were. Much strength can be found in that.|Fresh
Labors inside the sort of buffoonery that Burn After Reading achieved with much more cohesive performances and comic richness.|Rotten
Armando Iannucci explores how people in lofty offices don't have to be evil geniuses to cause irreparable harm...Iannucci skillfully manages to poke fun at pettiness while never losing track of how horrific Soviet purges were.|Fresh
Iannucci did not intend The Death of Stalin to be a direct commentary on the Trump presidency, and it should not be taken as one. But as they say: First time tragedy, second time farce.|Fresh
This isn't just a picture about the state of the Soviet Union in March 1953; it's very much about today.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is Iannucci's most complex and almost nihilistic rendering of what politics is:|Fresh
In The Death of Stalin, Iannucci brings his sharp ear for political doublespeak and workplace absurdity to the days after the demise of the notorious Soviet dictator...It's Iannucci's best work yet, although it might not be his funniest.|Fresh
Iannucci has taken a gamble with this movie, and that gamble has paid off handsomely. A tale of mortal sins as well as venial ones, The Death of Stalin adds modern urgency to his comic storytelling trademarks.|Fresh
From start to finish, director/co-writer Armando Iannucci (creator of HBO's brilliant Veep) delivers an audacious and insightful and ridiculous and hilarious send-up that reminded me of the classic Monty Python films of the 1970s and 1980s.|Fresh
... apart from Iannucci's own In The Loop, there's not much in recent English language cinema to even compare it to. Very recommended.|Fresh
The actors give top-rate, impressively in-character performances.|Fresh
There's a universality to the humor that will reach even those with only a vague knowledge of who Stalin was.|Fresh
The central conceit of The Death of Stalin is that what is funny is not always just funny. In this sense, the film is closer in spirit to Dr. Strangelove than, say Mel Brooks's The Producers.|Fresh
Amusing but broad, Marxism meets Mark Bros. take on last days of dictator from Veep's Armando Ianucci.|Fresh
'The Death of Stalin' may sound daunting, but poking at a dead dictator hasn't been this much fun since the days of Chaplin and the Marx Brothers.|Fresh
An often interminable misfire...|Rotten
Comes close to perfectly balancing comedy and savagery.|Fresh
There is something revelatory about transporting the bureaucratic machinations featured in Iannucci's previous work to the gulag archipelago that was Soviet Russia.|Fresh
The film is ruthless in its dissection of these people...|Fresh
Armando Iannucci's satire is blisteringly on point and delightfully scathing|Fresh
This is satirical history that invites prophecy - imagine a future Trump Administration version.|Fresh
It's some of the darkest humor you'll see on the big screen this year.|Fresh
Iannucci may have turned Nury's somber novel into something of a goof, but he also takes a more complex view of Beria...Death of Stalin is a priceless political satir but what's really impressive is how hard it tries to fit Beria's story into the puzzle.|Fresh
If it's a romp, then it's a romp that does what anything on this topic must do: leave audiences a little rattled, with a hint of ashes in the mouth.|Fresh

The Soviet Union may be no more, but we can still laugh about the bad old days.|Fresh
If you thought Armando Iannucci's takes on modern British and American politics were entertaining, just wait till you get a load of this hilarious and horrifying spin on a key moment in Russian history.|Fresh
Veep creator Armando Iannucci directs this bumbling display with consistently biting wit that doesn't venture too far into farce to be taken credibly.|Fresh
"""The Death of Stalin"" is a weird sort of hilarious, in that you easily might not laugh for minutes at a time. Instead of one big pie in the face, doled out at intervals, the movie presents an unending series of comic jabs ..."|Fresh
The Death of Stalin never mocks historical horrors. Instead, the broadness, the outrageousness, with which it dramatizes the banality of evil - and bureaucracy, too - is what makes it so very chilling.|Fresh
Sight gags and slapstick erupt from a pervasive atmosphere of dread and terror.|Fresh
It is a propitious material for the most incisive humor, for its sociopolitical core... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
While its shtick runs out a bit sooner than its runtime does, The Death of Stalin milks the sick irony of its setting for all it's worth.|Fresh

Historically speaking, you might say the dossier has been sexed up but I totally wallowed in the thing like a pig in muck...|Fresh
It's funny; ten times funnier, by my reckoning, than it has any right to be, and more riddled with risk than anything that Iannucci has done before, because it dares to meet outrage with outrage.|Fresh
Satire or farce, it misses the mark showing murderous, heartless brutes as akin to Keystone Kops. If they want to use real people and real names and real events, tell the real story. Chaplin changed everything but you knew it was Hitler. That's farce|Rotten

High-stakes politics, small-minded men: It's a sweet spot for filmmaker Armando Iannucci.|Fresh
When it comes to contemporary crafters of political satire, Armando Iannucci exists in an exalted realm all his own.|Fresh
It's a rich ensemble with varying accents, from Cockney to American, and uniform comic brilliance, including Michael Palin as Molotov, Jeffrey Tambor as Malenkov and Jason Isaacs as Zhukov.|Fresh
"In ""The Death of Stalin,"" a rambling, messy, fascinating film, the laughs come with a poisonous sting."|Fresh
Morbidly hilarious. And a great reminder why all right thinking Americans hate these bastards.|Fresh
It never asks us to laugh at cruelty; it does make us laugh at the absurd pettiness and ultimate small-mindedness of the men perpetrating that cruelty. And Iannucci is a superb ringmaster.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is a breath of fresh air and a genuinely great screen comedy. Iannucci conducts the proceedings like the conductor of a great orchestra with an array of virtuosos at his command.|Fresh
A breathtakingly dark comedy of errors with petty sniping and profane insults, cheerfully mining laughs from ghastly true events.|Fresh
Though The Death of Stalin is a one-joke movie about how plotting and pandemonium invariably pour into a leadership vacuum, it's a deadly serious joke that we'd do well to attend to.|Fresh
The script feels like a great writers-room comedy, where only the leanest and meanest bits stay, and the most startling and intriguing ideas persist.|Fresh
The chaos is darkly hilarious...|Fresh
Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Michael Palin, Jeffrey Tambor and Jason Isaacs create a formidable and selfless comedic quintet, while Iannucci's unyielding script and direction constantly stirs, twists and builds without ever overwhelming.|Fresh
Even played for comedy, the conditions surrounding, the characters affected by, and the succession struggle that followed Stalin's death are so rich in human drama as to be potentially Shakespearean.|Fresh
As long as The Death of Stalin is sticking it to the hypocrites in the Kremlin-mocking their vanity, pride, and other deadly sins-it's got the righteous riotousness of its creator's best work.|Fresh
It isn't history but free-range fiction, a venomous farce containing nuggets of fact, and if its subjects bear any resemblance to present-day dictators and authoritarian mugs or thugs around the world, then the movie has hit its archetypal target.|Fresh
a deft achievement, the telling of a treacherous historical event with the comedic chaos of the Marx Brothers and abrupt physical farce of the Three Stooges.|Fresh
"""The Death of Stalin"" is by turns entertaining and unsettling, with laughs that morph into gasps and uneasy gasps that erupt into queasy, choking laughs."|Fresh
"If anyone has a gift for ferreting out the ""petty"" in petty tyranny, it's Veep creator Armando Iannucci."|Fresh
"Thankfully, ""Stalin"" doesn't tucker out completely, and Iannucci's vision stretches without snapping, managing to make a biting but silly comedy out of political anxiety behind the Iron Curtain."|Fresh
This is a comedy of terrors that creates laughs but doesn't let you forget that Stalin and his coterie caused the deaths of untold numbers of Soviet citizens.|Fresh
As Stanley Kubrick did with Dr. Strangelove, Iannucci has built a satire not by twisting the truth but by nudging reality just a few inches further in the direction it was already going.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin brings Iannucci's love for political satire to a period in history that nobody could have expected.|Fresh
It takes some time to adjust to the mix of silly, peevish bureaucrats and the serious atrocities they inflict. But that's the beauty of the thing.|Fresh
Not since Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be has there been a movie satire as audacious as Armando Iannucci's The Death of Stalin.|Fresh
Armando Iannucci's hilarious, profane satire about politburos pole-positioning for power could not be more timely. It's the funniest, fiercest comedy of the year.|Fresh
I admired its daring and its ambition, but though it's well worth your time, it doesn't entirely come off.|Fresh
There's an irony here: In the interest of dramatic expediency, Iannucci has made the power players of The Death Of Stalin look more competent and more decisive than their real counterparts.|Fresh
... we can expect great work from the director [Armando Iannucci] in his major specialty: the ingenious insult... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is still a fascinating, engaging, and tongue-in-cheek look at one of the most chaotic of political times and the final moments of one of the most ruthless dictators the world has ever known.|Fresh
...pedestrian pulling humor. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Armando Ianucci has not made a neat, clean comedy, but an intelligent, fierce and risky one, that adds a substanial nuance to the domain of political satire. [Full Review in Spanihs]|Fresh
I enjoyed this so much that I screened it twice, back-to-back.|Fresh
Armando Iannucci satirizes the manner in which political power is accorded to those who can mask cutthroat ambition behind an outward projection of bland inoffensiveness.|Fresh
There's much to satirize about the struggle for power in the Kremlin after Stalin's death, but this juvenile, overly-broad comedy does not rise to the level of parody.|Rotten
This goofy cinematic vantage on the petty jealousies, backstabbing, and political maneuvering of Russia's Central Committee gives its audience a not so unrealistic sense of how politicians operate regardless of their country of origin.|Fresh
What luck we've had that Armando Iannucci was in charge of bringing this book to the screen. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""The Death of Stalin"" is a wickedly funny, pointedly scathing satire of corrupt power run amok."|Fresh
...some genuinely hilarious set ups and a nice mixture of farce and other styles of comedy.|Fresh
There's real horror in it too at times...It's a risk, where it could've been guilty of overreaching, but there's a chaotic tone here established into which it all fits quite snugly.|Fresh
Kudos are deserved everywhere for a well-written, beautifully played and offbeat piece of re-imagined history that's always funny despite humour sometimes stemming from a distinct sense of unease.|Fresh
... a little gem of black humor and historical revision. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A dark, hilarious tour de force.|Fresh
This dark and absurdist comedy is hugely enjoyable; but when it comes to authoritarian regimes, some more tragedy might have felt more affecting.|Fresh
The Death of Staling feels like a play, but doesn't feel like watching one. It feels like being in one, and it's a raucous, hilarious, hard-hitting play at that.|Fresh
A film that rides the line between irreverence and farce without trivialising the plight of the victims.|Fresh
Playing it straight is the secret. Turn down the volume and the picture would resemble any costume drama. Crank it back up again and the air becomes saltier than the Seregovo mine.|Fresh
Audacious, outrageous, bleakly funny. Not since Charlie Chaplin sent up Hitler and invited us to laugh at terrible reality has there been a movie like this.|Fresh
Jeffrey Tambor is perfect as the lugubrious Malenkov, and Beale oozes malice as Stalin's sadistic henchman Beria. And what a masterstroke it was to cast Steve Buscemi as Khrushchev.|Fresh
An impressive-looking and well-acted production that allows Jason Isaacs, as Field Marshal Zhukov, to show off his little-known talent for comedy, and which should see the genuinely brilliant Beale land a generous hatful of award nominations.|Fresh
Taken on its own terms, the movie is so enjoyable that niggles can easily be set aside. Above all, it's rich in good performances.|Fresh
A comprehensive rebuttal to those who say comedy cannot be fashioned from the most miserable circumstance.|Fresh
In a rather weak year for big screen comedy, The Death of Stalin can easily stake a claim as the year's funniest film.|Fresh
Just because The Death of Stalin is not Iannucci's funniest or most consistent work does not mean it's a total letdown.|Fresh
A frighteningly funny satire that finds humour in historical horror. Watch and feel better about the world.|Fresh
The tone ends up being oddly serious, the comedy bleak rather than black, and the final product is somehow both more sombre and less caustic than Iannucci's sharpest, silliest work.|Fresh
Actual quantities of laughter are diluted by the difficult satiric point, but the acting and the farce's whirring clockwork occupy you anyway.|Fresh
The film is uproariously funny but painfully close to the bone in a world where once again the lunatics have taken over the asylum.|Fresh
For all his dream-team cast and assured direction, despite capturing the laughable sycophancy of the apparatchik the film isn't that funny.|Rotten
The film is savagely, often uproariously, comic but the laughter freezes on your lips as you question if something this horrible can ever be truly funny.|Fresh
... punchy, raucous, savagely smart screen comedy...|Fresh
It makes Stalin and his gang look as absurd as they were abominable, which can't be a bad thing.|Fresh
Comedy of the year by a country mile.|Fresh
Generally, though, The Death of Stalin is an entertaining and often funny film, the tone of which will be familiar, if not wholly so, to fans of Iannucci's excellent previous work.|Fresh
This is not Iannucci's best work, but as Iannucci on a bad day is better than most on a good day, and there are brilliant moments, and you just can't argue with Simon Russell Beale -- in anything -- it's not nearly two hours wasted.|Fresh
Witty and scarily pertinent to almost any organisation, The Death Of Stalin is so brilliant it's a privilege to watch it.|Fresh
Darker and more violent than Iannucci's previous work, this is a brilliantly acted and very funny black comedy underscored with a jolt of genuine horror.|Fresh
Depending on your point of view, The Death of Stalin is either a sly, wintry satire on Armando Iannucci's usual theme of squawking political idiocy, or an insidious attempt to destabilise the Russian establishment with relentless dagger-blows.|Fresh
Iannucci's version of events may be well researched but it still gives us a very British, very witty but facetious version of a dark story which might have been better told by an insider.|Fresh
... Armando Iannucci's passable screwball comedy which might aspire to satire but actually isn't so.|Fresh
An audacious comedy of horrors, the film has the feel of a bad dream you find yourself not wanting to wake up from.|Fresh
A riotous farce of doublespeak and plotting laced with moments of bitumen-black horror.|Fresh
Make sure you pay your respects to the funniest film of 2017, as Monty Python meets TV's The Thick of It in this outrageous and brilliant historical satirical farce.|Fresh
Taken strictly as a workout in elastic ensemble performance and rapid-fire verbal pugilism, The Death of Stalin is consistently entertaining. But enjoying Iannucci's film means depoliticizing the source material.|Fresh
Mixes hard shocks and big laughs to often dazzling effect.|Fresh
A film as riotously funny as it is alarmingly pertinent.|Fresh
This is classic comedy gold, in many ways reminiscent of the old Monty Python show sketches skewering politicians, but with a slightly more serious spin.|Fresh
Armando Iannucci pulls off a balancing act that's more remarkable the more you think about it: this is a movie that's both mercilessly grim and uproariously funny.|Fresh
Surreal, intriguing and strangely affecting, The Death of Stalin is simultaneously familiar and totally different to anything Armando Iannucci has done before.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is full of pithy one-liners and cringe-inducing power struggles laced with black humor.|Fresh
[Armando] Iannucci has never turned in a film that looks this ravishing, which serves as an interesting juxtaposition with all the top-shelf cruelty on display.|Fresh
Heaps of praise will be deservedly lumped onto the core cast members, but some of the movie's sharpest moments come from the supporting cast.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is a scathingly funny satire about power-mad nerds and bumbling bureaucrats that could only come from Armando Iannucci.|Fresh
This may be Iannucci's weakest-written film, but it's by far his best-directed one.|Fresh
For those who've enjoyed Armando Iannucci's latter day career as the driving force behind The Thick Of It and Veep, The Death Of Stalin reassuringly offers more of the same.|Fresh
As perfectly conducted as the orchestra performances that open and close the film, The Death Of Stalin zips along merrily as alliances are formed, plots are hatched and lives are destroyed.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin is Iannucci's most complex and almost nihilistic rendering of what politics is: A team of bumbling and weak-minded people who lack any real conviction other than a desire for power and position.|Fresh
Iannucci masterfully blends dark humour about an authoritarian regime and farcical comedy performed with perfect timing.|Fresh
Its application of [Iannucci's] signature barbed comic voice to such grim history (executions are a constant source of gallows humor) packs its own punch.|Fresh
A delicious black comedy ...|Fresh
It will more than satisfy Iannucci's fans at arthouses; here's hoping we don't have to wait another eight years to see the director's next film.|Fresh
The Death of Stalin marks the first instance in which Iannucci has applied his style to real-life figures, and it's as though he has crafted a historical foundation for the rest of his work.|Fresh
Master satirist Armando Iannucci's new film is ostensibly a comedy, but the laughs don't come easy and the jokes are often laced with malice and paranoia.|Fresh
There is one thing that power can't stand, and that is to be mocked: The social importance of this topical romp should not be underestimated.|Fresh
An occasionally funny, often straight-faced film about a cruel leader's cronies and how self-interest doesn't stall for death.|Fresh
A raunchy, hilarious history lesson.|Fresh
Although the laughs don't come as frequently as In the Loop or Veep, The Death of Stalin is still consistently funny and delightfully mean-spirited.|Fresh
Iannucci's brand of political satire is applied to one of the darkest chapters in modern history, with sensational results.|Fresh
