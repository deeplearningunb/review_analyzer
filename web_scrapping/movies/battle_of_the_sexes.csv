Stone is terrific, driven in some areas, riven with self-doubt in others; Carell makes Riggs' obsession with relentless showbiz chauvinism rather poignant. Billie Jean's relationship with Marilyn plays out beautifully, the camera an intimate confidante.|Fresh

"With Battle of the Sexes, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"") has written another contemplative and intriguing film fueled with hearty cynicism, off-kilter frivolity and balanced relevance."|Fresh
The acting in Battle of the Sexes is what elevates it well beyond the average sports film.|Fresh
A solid, yet flawed biopic that does justice to its subject matter without rising to an elite level.|Rotten
It's tragic how much of the film remains pertinent to 2017's culture.|Fresh
Emma Stone and Steve Carell are both absolutely dynamic as King and Riggs.|Fresh
The film moves forward well enough but lacks the spark viewers would expect.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes is just a flat biopic that more often than not feels like a bad parody.|Rotten
It's so satisfying to watch. Sports movies are very hit-or-miss for me. When they're a hit, though, they hit hard and with gusto. This is one of those films.|Fresh
Disappointing slumps in crafting King's story are wonderfully compensated with charged performances from everyone|Fresh
We watch [King's] evolution from hero on the court to international icon breaking barriers off it. [And] on those terms Battle of the Sexes is a resounding success.|Fresh
The directors did a credible job...it was a thorough examination of what was going on, not just the tennis match...|Fresh
I liked the stories and the performances. Steve Carell was fantastic...when my daughter gets older, I'll certainly show her this film.|Fresh
This is one of those cookie-cutter productions that is tailored to speak to Big Issues and give its audiences a rousing dose of Feelings, especially now that we are now in an era where chauvinism is being rightly uprooted and raked over the coals.|Rotten
In fact, Stone looses herself in the role, successfully transforming herself into the iconic tennis player. Her portrayal is a well studied one.|Fresh
An entertainingly inspirational biopic that works through the charm & performances of the cast and stylistic filmmaking.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes is an entertaining, fun, sometimes touching, and sometimes enlightening look at the world of tennis, the struggles of sexual identity, and the sexism of the time.|Fresh
"If you see ""Battle,"" you'll be the winner - whether you love Stone or not."|Fresh
"Battle of the Sexes"" lobs some easy ones over the net, and the result is extremely watchable, if not extremely memorable."|Fresh
It's a sports movie, complete with breathless action sequences, overwrought crowd reactions, and a soaring score. It's a biopic about a legend. And it's one of the best lesbian films I've ever seen.|Fresh
Serves as a useful reminder of the crazy-huge role that pop culture plays in our national life, where the border between entertainment and real life is more porous than anywhere else.|Fresh

The emotional stakes never really feel all that high throughout.|Fresh
I hope someday someone will make the movie that the trailer for Battle of the Sexes, the PG-13 sports biography starring Emma Stone and Steve Carell as Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, promises.|Rotten
It's a solid film and very entertaining, with good performances throughout, but too often marred by expositional stretches filled with on-the-nose dialogue.|Fresh
"Great casting makes a great comedy, and some brilliant strokes are served with the sports dramedy, ""Battle of the Sexes."""|Fresh
A middling biopic that jams on the brakes about every 10 minutes.|Rotten
Battle is an extremely well-made movie artistically and should be kept in the game as a contender for critics' honors and the Oscars at the end of the year.|Fresh
Dayton and Faris have equally made Battle of the Sexes a very accessible film whose crowd-pleasing spirit should not disguise the lessons it makes to be learned.|Fresh
It's mostly lighthearted fun. The two leads exhibit familiar character beats: Stone is sweet, toggling between tentative and quietly determined, while Carell finds the note of pathos beneath Riggs' braying goofball.|Fresh
Andrea Riseborough is this film's secret weapon.|Fresh
This film is much more than a skilful re-enactment. It's a witty and insightful exploration of the kind of person who chases sporting success and global fame, even when the odds are stacked against them.|Fresh

[Battle of the Sexes] lacks power, forcefulness; it stays on the surface of things. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
At 121 minutes, Battle of the Sexes occasionally drags, but it's the Hairy Legged Feminist-Male Chauvinist Pig showdown that we needed right now.|Fresh
Interestingly enough, is that had it not been for a handful of diehard chauvinists one of the most iconic moments of the women's rights movement might never have happened.|Fresh
Co-directors Valerie Faris and Jonathon Dayton, working from Simon Beaufoy's screenplay, deliver a layered, moving, funny and fascinating movie.|Fresh
Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs are two characters worth building a film around, and the film does well to portray both as more complex than they might have been in less capable hands, but the actual match they had doesn't make for a great conclusion.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes shows how those seeds of change were sewn. As such, it's game, set and match to female empowerment that deserves to be a smash hit with audiences.|Fresh

A light, funny, blissfully entertaining flick about heavy, sadly still relevant themes.|Fresh
There's fun to be had watching Stone deliver comeuppance to this clown, although the film takes its sweet time getting there, mostly because King keeps turning him down.|Fresh
Battle Of The Sexes has become a film that reveals just how little progress has been made and it's all the better and more powerful for it. You can certainly see why it's starting to generate some deserved pre-awards buzz.|Fresh
The film may borrow the name from the much-hyped match, but Little Miss Sunshine directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris know far more interesting conflicts were playing out off the court.|Fresh
This dramatisation revisits those carnivalesque events in splendidly springy fashion, achieving the quadruple grand slam feat of being emotionally engaging, politically intriguing, dramatically gripping and frequently very funny.|Fresh
Stone and Carell ace it in this smart biopic, stylishly recreating the champ-vs-clown clash of the tennis titans that electrified '70s America.|Fresh
Smashing the snappy dialogue out of the court is the supremely funny Steve Carell as Riggs and the wonderfully buoyant Emma Stone as King.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes has the honour of being the first great film about tennis, but it's also a joyous celebration of an important moment of progress that needs to be remembered - now more than ever.|Fresh
Stone gives her best performance since she first exploded as a fully formed generational talent in 2010's Easy A.|Fresh
The glib screenplay is often thumpingly obvious but this is an entertaining crowd-pleaser.|Fresh
The movie unfolds a bit like a really good baseline rally: a blow for the men, a counter-blow for the women.|Fresh
As a palate cleanser for 2017, you could do much worse than Battle of the Sexes, a lightweight but likable sports movie.|Fresh
Watching male chauvinism get a drubbing will never not be good cinematic sport, and Battle of the Sexes gives us ringside seats.|Fresh
A seductively enjoyable, smart and well-acted film ...|Fresh
Emma Stone delivers perhaps her finest performance to date, adeptly conveying King's fiery determination, but also her heart-breaking vulnerability.|Fresh
Emma Stone and Andrea Riseborough are so great together you'll wish the whole movie was about their character's relationship. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In a performance tinged with comedy and pathos, Carrell captures Riggs's sleaziness, his chutzpah and his childlike quality.|Fresh
If you accept that you're being sold a simplified snapshot, Battle of the Sexes is a lot of fun.|Fresh
Carell, terrific and a little horrific, gets him exactly. He wins the film, though we won't reveal the match outcome.|Fresh
As they did in Sunshine, [Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris] adroitly walk the line between poking fun at the characters - here, Carell's pathetic, attention-seeking Riggs is the main target - and winning sympathy for them.|Fresh
Any head-scratching about Stone playing King ceases within the first few minutes - she's perfect in the role.|Fresh
Meanwhile, the triple threat of Sarah Silverman, Alan Cumming and Elisabeth Shue all rolled up in one film is a joy almost too great to bear.|Fresh
Stone is a marvel, drawing you in as a crusader. You also feel her strains and internal struggles.|Fresh

Effectively delves behind the scenes of the people and stakes behind one of the biggest spectacles in sport.|Fresh
"In keeping with the tennis theme, it's hard to find ""fault"" in the performances being offered here."|Fresh
Stone's signature blend of breezy charm and deep empathy is so winning, it eclipses the screenplay's broader strokes, and the more heavily affected performances of her co-stars.|Fresh
A highly entertaining account.... The movie belongs to Emma Stone.|Fresh
I was expecting this to be more of a comedy than it was, but it is a surprisingly compelling and frank biopic about the two people involved in one of the most famous and important sports events of the last century.|Fresh
The most powerful - and also the most depressing - thing about Battle of the Sexes is how relevant King's struggle still is today.|Fresh
This is an exceptional film, insightfully conceived and built on a beautifully written script by British Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire).|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes is a well crafted film, and it's potentially the most crowd pleasing feature you'll see all year, but it just lacks the oomph to fall firmly into greatness.|Fresh
Directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton have crafted an astute film where the drama mostly unfolds without confrontation.|Fresh
Finally, a tennis movie that works. After the disappointing Borg vs McEnroe, we get another high-profile tennis film about a clash of personalities, only this one is defined by thrills, heartache, politics and passion.|Fresh
An artless, facile gaze at an American icon, a film whose look and dialogue often come off like an adaptation of the back of a vintage Wheaties box.|Rotten
Faris and Dayton are interested in how the players got there, not in the game itself, and their emphasis on the whole environment of the match creates a far richer and chewier film than the usual triumphant sports drama.|Fresh
It succeeds because it treats viewers to what television audiences didn't see when Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs faced each other.|Fresh
Shot with the verve of an after-school special, hammering its points with the subtlety of a carpenter banging nails, it feels like a parody of an empowerment movie.|Rotten
It's a pity that the film is as patchy as it because individually some of the working parts here are undeniably impressive.|Rotten
It's a moment in history worth retelling...|Fresh
The story of a remarkable woman and her remarkable accomplishments suffers, as too many LGBTQ-themed twenty-first-century docudramas do, from an accretion of it-gets-better telegraphing.|Rotten
Trailblazers like Billie Jean King deserve our thanks, and the tribute she receives in this movie.|Fresh
By the way, Battle of the Sexes is also quite a funny film too. It has it all.|Fresh
It's fun and suspenseful, and rounded out by a delightful supporting cast, including Sarah Silverman and Alan Cummings.|Fresh
The final result is a film that is much more complex than expected, but also a film that viewers will likely evaluate based on its message more than its execution.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes serves up a history lesson and a message of equality that is as timely now as it was more than 40 years ago, but it's a bit too soft to call the film a grand-slam winner.|Fresh
Fun and extremely easy to watch. But ... feels like a massive missed opportunity.|Fresh
King and Riggs' famous tussle inspires an engaging, entertaining effort - one that's as much about the showdown at its centre as it is the struggles it stood for.|Fresh
despite being aware of the outcome-I caught myself quite literally cheering when Emma Stone's King got a point off Steve Carell's Riggs during the big showdown.|Fresh
A terrific-looking movie photographed with intelligence and written in crayon.|Rotten
Like real life, the movie loses some steam when the big match rolls around. Nothing on the court could match what led King and Riggs there and the same goes for Dayton and Faris' movie.|Fresh
Battle Of The Sexes is an important re-stating of an important moment in sport, and its subject matter is as pertinent now as it was then.|Fresh
A highly engaging film that frequently keeps a light touch even as it tackles weighty subjects.|Fresh
Emma Stone aces empowerment, focusing on the social change that swept the country during the last quarter of the 20th century.|Fresh
Instead of so much emphasis on the obvious, you wish Beaufoy had dug a bit deeper.|Fresh

Despite any faults, or double faults - which also includes some dialogue that sounds suspiciously like too-meaningful speeches - Battle of the Sexes is an entertaining, well-performed history lesson in the sociology of the early 1970s.|Fresh
[King's and Riggs'] scenes together are handled with unusual delicacy.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes feels like a safe retelling of the event, no matter what its revolutionary implications. Faris and Dayton err on the side of the commercial, putting out a self-congratulatory message.|Rotten

Does Battle of the Sexes break new ground in terms of cinematic form? No. But it's an exceedingly well-done film...|Fresh
The casting is the movie's strength, and both actors milk just about every drop possible from Simon Beaufoy's strictly workmanlike screenplay.|Fresh
Put another way, this is one tennis movie that could have used more topspin.|Rotten
Steve Carell is a marvelous chameleon who shape shifts through Bobby's moods.|Fresh

The battle for equality may not be over, but Battle of the Sexes reminds us-in the slogan of the women's tour sponsor-we've come a long way, baby.|Fresh
This wonderfully entertaining, authentic-looking recreation captures the feverish spirit of the time as the nascent, all-powerful medium of television fed a media circus that publicised the event as a culture-shifting moment in modern history.|Fresh
King fought for better pay for women's professional tennis players ... Battle of the Sexes captures that zeitgeist. Just not in the way you expect.|Fresh
"""Battle of the Sexes"" is more than just an empowerment victory lap for women and others seeking equality; it's a heartfelt love story or two, and a fantastic time capsule resurrecting the early '70s with aplomb."|Fresh
The joyous movie Battle of the Sexes covers every inch of the court -- as an inspirational sports drama, as a riotous comedy, as a tender romance and as an insightful biography of King and her pivotal role in the fight for women's equality.|Fresh
... Stone merely underlines why her Best Actress win this year was the right choice, effortlessly carrying an ensemble cast-and major feminist messages still ringing out now-on the temples of her glasses.|Fresh
Often a reviewer feels compelled to compare a movie with a much better book or play. In this case, it's the documentary.|Rotten
Steve Carell plays the loudmouth hustler Riggs as exactly the one-note, surface-level caricature you would expect, and the film veers chaotically from googly-eyed comedy to sincere drama as a result.|Rotten
More striking is the array of social issues that this circuslike event brought to international attention more than four decades ago.|Fresh
It's a director's duty to make sure we know that the past was a place where people really feared to step out of line. Director Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris fulfilled that duty.|Fresh
A breezy, funny film about serious subject matter, Battle of the Sexes benefits from some winning lead performances and the admirably light touch...|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes does many things wonderfully well. It tells a complex story with clarity, brevity and wit. It establishes a couple of superbly well-written and played characters.|Fresh
It's a shame that Battle of the Sexes feels like little more than a primer to a different, more fascinating film.|Rotten
Battle of the Sexes is not deep enough to speak truth to the enduring powerful impact this match had then and continues to have, now that sports again is a battleground in our never-ending cultural wars.|Fresh
It's not just an irresistible entertainment by the two directors who gave us Little Miss Sunshine and written by the writer who gave us Slumdog Millionaire and The Full Monty. It's a movie with social and emotional substance.|Fresh

Battle of the Sexes is compelling and enjoyable to watch, thanks in large part to the performances, even if some of the outsized supporting characters... are given the lamest lines.|Fresh
Stone and Carell are both marvelous - even if they are, at times, in different movies.|Fresh
The pace is swift, and the '70s setting is rich: the throbbing soundtrack, the retro click of a telephone dial, the bright colors and pageantry of the match.|Fresh
Emma Stone and Steve Carell are both excellent, which makes you wish Beaufoy had done more with the story's most complicated friendship-between the two well-matched athletes.|Fresh
[Emma] Stone gives a standout performance - alternately funny, warm and heartbreaking.|Fresh
With its genius cast, wonderfully calibrated emotional and comic beats, and brilliant 70s mimesis, Battle of the Sexes is slick, commercial filmmaking at its best.|Fresh
As upbeat and entertaining as it undeniably is, Battle Of The Sexes sees that battle as ongoing.|Fresh
"Without sermonizing, ""Battle of the Sexes"" speaks to issues that are sadly all too contemporary, but it does so in a way that is entertaining, thoughtful and emotionally engaging, making it a worthy entry in the Oscar race."|Fresh
The actual tennis is the least important element of Battle of the Sexes. The film is much more interested in relationships and King's evolution. Its best moments come off the court, especially when King and company break off to form the WTA.|Fresh
Real life sucks, especially its misogyny. Fortunately, this is not only the greatest tennis film ever made but also a rousing piece of entertainment.|Fresh
While it threatens at time to lose its focus, its performances -- and its blend of history and humor -- make it a very enjoyable, and recommendable, film.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes is almost by definition predictable - the outcome of its title tennis match is well known - but there was one scene that made my jaw drop.|Fresh
...directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris keep a number of balls in the air, juggling actual tennis play, the hype leading up to a game that would be watched by 90 million, and the personal lives of their protagonists.|Fresh
The message feels programmed like some LGBTQ version of a Hallmark card. Sometimes capital letters are needed to get the attention of those persons who most need to hear what needs to be said.|Fresh
A stirring, colorful, and amusing effort, finding different ways to approach an oft-told tale.|Fresh
It's worthwhile, but there's a lot more to this story.|Fresh
Emma Stone is dazzling. She is more Billie Jean than Billie Jean.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes is a film that needs to wrap together several concerns into its overarching feminist manifesto and it just didn't have the time to deal with everything properly. Consequently, it feels like some steps were skipped over.|Fresh
The movie is stretching credibility a bit far when it comes to establishing the lasting significance of the freakish contest which ends this saga.|Rotten
Battle of the Sexes is a film as concerned with the present as the past.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes gets it right where it counts by conveying the complexity of Billie Jean King's story - and reminding us all that the fight for basic fairness isn't over.|Fresh
You don't have to be a tennis fan to warm to this highly entertaining story in which passion, determination and courage are the drivers.|Fresh
The problem is that King's story is so much more compelling than Riggs', so (in spite of Carell's best efforts), the character just becomes a distraction - and the filmmakers seem weirdly invested in letting him off the hook.|Rotten
The level of craft and intelligence that goes into making a movie that affects an audience like this one does is not inconsiderable. Worse things can be said about a film than that it's effective. But effective films can also be annoying.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes thrives as a crowd-pleasing sports story with charm to spare, even as it sugarcoats the real-life events that inspired it.|Fresh
The big issue with Battle of the Sexes may just be how much territory it cedes to Riggs, or rather, Carell-as-Riggs, who frankly kinda steals the movie.|Rotten
Battle Of the Sexes is a well-played crowd pleaser with a decent backhand volley.|Fresh
Stone and Carell both give big, winning movie-star performances, even if they can't quite be said to disappear into their roles.|Fresh
When the movie finally turns to the climactic match, complete with excited volley-by-volley coverage and roaring crowd, the whiplash takes some getting used to.|Rotten
If Battle of the Sexes is unsurprising to a fault, it's by no means a double fault. The movie is very entertaining.|Fresh
Despite great turns by Stone and Carell, BATTLE OF THE SEXES would have done better with a wittier, nuanced script and less clunky, anachronistic forecasting.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes is about so much more than its sport. It's a gateway towards showing how harsh criticism was for women, and how it remains so to this day.|Fresh
Headlined by another Oscar-worthy performance from Emma Stone, the film aches with an impressive and touching tale of self-discovery.|Fresh
"There are more artistically inspired versions of the ""Battle of the Sexes"" story, but in art, like in tennis, the moment dictates the shot; this moment called for a crisp forehand smash, and ""Battle of the Sexes"" delivered."|Fresh

An exhilarating movie propelled by two mesmerizing star performances-Emma Stone and Steve Carell.|Fresh
Society didn't learn to stop oppressing women from a tennis match and I don't think they're going to learn from a movie either. Battle of the Sexes is a good example for those still fighting that you can take the high road and win small victories.|Fresh
The concentration on sex serves to belittle the enormous risk King took in boycotting the Pacific Southwest Tournament and the revolution she instigated. Too bad.|Rotten
it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it seems to have respect for both the story's hero and its villain.|Fresh
Carell's cartoonish antics are funny enough, but the two women are the tale's real champions.|Fresh
Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton focus on the complexities of the rivals' personal lives with empathy and compassion.|Fresh
Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris evoke the 70s well, and the film flows with information about the match and those involved, but you're never fully invested.|Rotten
This overlong, half-comic rewriting of the history of the 1973 tennis stunt. . .is so heavily slanted toward the goal of advancing feminism that it neglects to offer a humanely balanced portrait of the players.|Rotten
At times, it works. But at others, it struggles to find its footing, and sometimes it flat-out falls down.|Rotten
The movie is stolen by putative supporting player Steve Carell. He's so able to find the heartrending desperation behind Riggs' show-biz chauvinism that he might have viewers developing a rooting interest in the wrong side of history.|Fresh
"The story becomes much more than simply a tennis exhibition. And, quite fittingly, Stone, Carell, a grand ensemble cast, and their ""Little Miss Sunshine"" co-directors mostly get back to the top of their game."|Fresh
A movie that will leave you with a good feeling coming out of the theater.|Fresh
Moving dramedy serves up sexism, sexuality; lots of smoking.|Fresh
"""[W]omen's lib"" wasn't (and isn't) about trying to prove women are better than men. It is about challenging assumptions that men are better than women simply because they're men."|Fresh
"By attempting to use the sports world as a lens through which to view the social-sexual currents of its time, the filmmakers turn ""Battle of the Sexes"" into a barely muted rallying cry for equality in our own time."|Fresh
The new movie Battle of the Sexes portrays this circus-like time in the past perfectly.|Fresh
Imagine Hillary and Trump Swinging Rackets. Emma Stone and Steve Carell's recreation of the media circus that was the '73 King-Riggs tennis match couldn't be more relevant.|Fresh
If Battle of the Sexes is more than a little slight in places, it more than makes up for its shortcomings through sheer entertainment value.|Fresh
They found the human story, the vulnerability, the drive, the fear, the resolve behind the hoopla and hyperbole.|Fresh
Handsome and moving if a bit cautious, Battle is full of smart complexities and sensational acting.|Fresh
The performances are strong, there are number of big laughs and legitimately emotional moments and the decision to shoot in 35mm gives the film a subtly authentic period flavor that helps to sell the proceedings.|Fresh
Even if you've Googled the outcome, or are old enough to remember watching it on television, the film's reenactment of the battle and the bluster makes for entertaining and at times riveting viewing.|Fresh
It's a feel-good film with a somewhat curdled legacy: You could clip just about any piece of sexist dialogue here, label it 2017 and pass it off as plausible.|Fresh
It deserves to be said that Mr. Carell is both a bona-fide movie star and a marvelous actor, two things that don't always go together.|Fresh
King's ambivalence and reluctance, and her understanding that the position she found herself in as an advocate had the capacity to paint her into a corner, are the best parts of the new film.|Fresh
The movie is so intent on pointing out the sexism of the day ... that it more or less brushes off a key part of Billie's life as something to be addressed later.|Rotten
Battle of the Sexes may have laughs aplenty, but at its heart is the serious issue of equality, and the argument is well served.|Fresh
The film is at its best when the lens is tightened on the personal factors that led to King and Riggs' showdown.|Fresh
It hardly matters that the match itself doesn't look like much. The symbolic power of what happened there - one small step, one giant leap for womankind - is still the movie's truest ace.|Fresh
Unlike the election, you'll be able to cheer while watching Battle of the Sexes.|Fresh
Emma Stone does the best work of her career. Her Billie Jean King is a champion on multiple levels.|Fresh
The movie's implied contention that women's tennis offers the same quality of play as men's simply doesn't withstand acquaintance with the facts.|Rotten
An essential history lesson with a smart smack of relevance for today (because feminism always has to be relitigated). It's also warm, funny, and hugely entertaining.|Fresh
Under an entertaining story of two high-profile people who came to represent social upheaval on a tennis court, the Battle of the Sexes is also a timely reminder of the backsliding currently going on in America.|Fresh
In its focus on King, it's ... a compelling internal story, demonstrating that athletic achievement is not only a matter of physical gifts. At the highest levels, where the pressure is greatest, it really comes down to character.|Fresh
"A stirring, affectionately felt biopic about a necessary milestone in sports history. The not-so-secret weapon of ""Battle of the Sexes"" is Billie Jean King herself, and Emma Stone's impassioned turn playing her."|Fresh

"""Battle"" is most involving when it deals not with sports or society but the personal struggles both players, especially King, were going through in the run-up to the match."|Fresh
It's not a revolution in biopic storytelling, but it treats all of its characters like real people, not narrative speedbumps, and that's refreshing.|Fresh

A warm, earnestly entertaining film ...|Fresh
"Stone won an Academy Award for ""La La Land,"" but she's better here, probably the best she's ever been."|Fresh
"In most sports films, we always know who we're supposed to be rooting for. For all its feel-good, formulaic biopic tendencies, ""Battle of the Sexes"" is notable for rethinking this narrative trope."|Fresh
The movie is both fun and a mild disappointment ...|Fresh
A winning combination of sports movie and civil rights story, with ace performances from Stone and Carell.|Fresh

Battle of the Sexes is, at best, a light volley of banter and debate over important topics, rather than a hard-hitting expose with contemporary ties to ongoing gender discussions (which it easily could have been).|Fresh
A fairly standard, if unexceptional film that has two major things going for it: Emma Stone and timeliness.|Fresh
Where Battle Of The Sexes wins though, is the way it perfectly captures the silliness and yet also the utmost importance of one tennis match that pitted a man against women for one night only. It's a triumph, just like King.|Fresh
"The ""Battle Of The Sexes"" was the 1973 tennis exhibition that, as overhyped spectacle, was the Mayweather/McGregor match of its day. And it's fleshed out as first-rate soap in the movie of the same name starring Emma Stone and Steve Carell."|Fresh
While Battle of the Sexes is a reminder of the gender issues still plaguing us, it wholeheartedly embraces the equality of its two excellent leads.|Fresh

Have we really come a long way, baby?|Fresh
"A film based on a true story should have three things - strong characters, fierce conflict and a fresh angle. ""Battle of the Sexes"" serves up all of them."|Fresh
The steady procession of setups and payoffs can feel suspiciously pat. Yet the new movie holds more surprises.|Fresh
Emma Stone is the standout, bringing an astounding power and depth to her role as she layers the complexities of King.|Fresh
It doesn't feel like a history lesson or a sermon. It feels like a conversation, laced with purpose and passion, but so generously sprinkled with charm, heart, and humor you might wish it'd never end.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes is so shrewd in other areas that it's hard to complain. What Battle of the Sexes understands is that this match looked entirely different depending on which side you were rooting for.|Fresh
A fun, audience-friendly slice of nostalgia not unlike AMERICAN HUSTLE.|Fresh
It's a fertile premise, but the film somehow underperforms.|Fresh
A disjointed biopic that frustratingly settles for pleasing the crowds rather than wowing them.|Rotten

The film sacrifices some of its innate appeal by making ham out of the supposed relics of a less enlightened era.|Rotten
There's a better version of Battle of the Sexes that focuses even more fully on King, villainizing Riggs and his grotesque culture of sexism in a way this movie disappointingly seems scared to do.|Rotten
Although it's largely affable despite its shortcomings, the movie feels like a weak gesture rather than a grand slam.|Rotten
Though told in broad strokes, its version of the story deserves credit for never buying into the hype and surreal pageantry of the Astrodome showdown.|Fresh
Served up with star turns from Emma Stone and Steve Carell, Battle Of The Sexes slams a crowdpleaser across the net.|Fresh
Directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton move beyond the ready-made charisma of the serve-and-volley shenanigans to offer a contextualized portrait of the closet-lesbian King and her fight against sexism and the social mores of the time.|Fresh
Stone is strong in a steely, unshowy role and it's rewarding to see her outside of her comfort zone; Carell is an annoying and cartoonish presence but, well, so was Riggs.|Fresh

"What Battle of the Sexes misses is the opportunity to make a movie that isn't a stupid, self-satisfied situation comedy with a ""big match"" at the end."|Rotten
This is a film that admires - even awes at - Billie Jean King, but it doesn't share her commitment to the game.|Rotten
Billy Jean King wins. Not just the 1973 Battle of the Sexes tennis match against Bobby Riggs, but the hugely entertaining and inspiring movie of the same name. It's all aces.|Fresh
Battle of the Sexes is the feel good female empowerment film that the world needs right now.|Fresh
"""Battle Of The Sexes"" might not be a grand slam final, but it's certainly worth the cost of seeing a match in person."|Fresh
