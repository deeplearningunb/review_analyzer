The prospect of Nicolas Cage going full-bore crazy in a gory grindhouse revenge thriller will have genre fans salivating.|Fresh
Visually mind-blowing, Mandy has a real taste for aesthetics but not so much for story|Rotten
There's an incredible, cult pulp horror film in here somewhere, but Mandy is too overindulgent to bring it out.|Fresh
It's the perfect role for Cage, and it's one he embraces wholeheartedly.|Fresh
Gorgeous cinematography and score don't make Mandy half as cool as it thinks it is.|Rotten
"Between Red's acumen for bloodletting and Cosmatos' pushing of boundaries in glamour gore, ""Mandy"" is poised for near-instant cult classic status."|Fresh
Psychedelic horror had never been this relevant and effective. Nicolas Cage delivers one of the best genre performances of the year. [Full review in Spanish].|Fresh
A slow-motion descent into a sludge-rock hell as Nicolas Cage tracks a killer hippie cult across a landscape that seems printed on discarded Mountain and Uriah Heep album covers and painted with tar.|Fresh
In a world as scary as this one is right now, Mandy makes an intuitive sort of sense.|Fresh
"The prog-metal outrageousness of Mandy is established when King Crimson's ""Starless"" both plays over and gets listed in the opening credits, while Nicolas Cage offers his once-a-decade reminder of why we ever cared."|Fresh

An offbeat endeavor that's basically for folks who might find Death Wish (any version) too quaint for their tastes.|Fresh
I've never taken LSD but now I know what a bad acid trip must feel like thanks to the destined to become a midnight classic, Mandy.|Fresh
There are no concessions in Cosmatos' work. And that, on this or any other film, is worthy of applause.|Fresh
As good as Cosmatos is at atmosphere and nightmarish scenarios, he would benefit from working with someone who keeps his self-indulgent tendencies in check.|Rotten
Cage's Red Miller unleashes a roaring rampage of revenge the likes of which we've never seen...|Fresh
Mandy achieves its goals with blunter and larger instruments, which is all the better...|Fresh
This is an exceptionally thoughtful, striking horror picture with an all-time great Nicolas Cage performance at its core. Mandy is the reason midnight movies are a thing.|Fresh
Mandy is an incredible odyssey that embarks on the line between the mystic and the psychotic. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Who doesn't love a crazed Cage?|Fresh
The concept is incredible and hilarious at the end - but is a big mess.|Rotten
Mandy eschews rationality for the Rule of Cool, but Cosmatos presents every splatter of nutzoid weirdness with such ecstatic panache, it's hard not to be seduced.|Fresh
'Mandy' is a beautiful and monstrous joyride into the hell of vengeance.|Fresh
Cosmatos never delivers the over-the-top crazy Cage that I was hoping for, or at least not in the satisfying, crescendo building manner I craved.|Rotten
This movie's actually quite layered. It's fun to think about.|Fresh
If ever there was a movie I could declare straight-faced as not being for everyone, MANDY would be it. The movie is overheated, highly stylized, and boasts a chainsaw-on-chainsaw duel. And yet... if you catch its vibe? You are just gonna love it.|Fresh
Cage is a force of nature. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Beautifully-shot film, although sometimes the use of processed grain and lens flares were distracting. The second half was exactly what I wanted, but the first half is a bit slow.|Fresh
A chaotic, drug-fuelled, heavy metal, balls-to-the-wall extravaganza of violence and carnage.|Fresh
Phrases spring to mind like 'fever-dream' or 'hallucinatory trip' but they're not enough to convey the absolute single-minded, relentless perfection of the vision and craft that this film presents.|Fresh
Cage blends heartbreaking pain with murderous thoroughness as his character crisscrosses the line into maniacal enthusiasm in this gleefully bloodthirsty and often moving revenge fantasy.|Fresh
The mythical journey progresses from dreamlike somnambulism to abstraction avoiding articulating itself as a conventional story. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Mandy is a triumph of both genre film-making and art, an unfiltered glimpse into the mind of an artist.|Fresh
The metalhead romance transforms into a story of revenge where Cage emerges as a Cimmerian warrior, chewing and spitting out Joseph Campbell's hero's journey upon a pool of blood. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cage's performance didn't develop or change, it just falls in the right place, where his crazy reactions & over the top acting become traits that help the film & distinguish him.|Fresh
It's so good to see Nicolas Cage back in a film that rewards his bold approach to acting, because Mandy is bold and uncompromising, too.|Fresh
Mandy is a surreal, heavy metal descent into madness.|Fresh
The Mandy experience is like a memorably bad trip; it's somehow way more wild, alarming, and strangely hilarious than can be put into easy words.|Fresh
Mandy is a journey of an innocent soul as it's ripped from the corporeal plane, torn asunder, and reconstructed as something that must feed on fire and blood.|Fresh
The film just feels alien. It feels evil. It courses with a sort of seething darkness and descends into such brain-swelling madness that you can almost smell it.|Fresh
A mind-bending phantasmagoria that sees a career-best Cage tackle a cult in neon-smothered hell.|Fresh
Tonally closer to a stark, melancholy mood piece than heavy-metal horror show.|Fresh
I warmed up to its first hour only to find myself a bit distanced by the second, due to its familiarity of revenge movie tropes and gory confrontation that we've seen many times before.|Rotten
If you're on the fence with your opinion of [Cage] as a performer I think you'll find yourself swayed to the right side here - he is terrific, and I laud him for fighting to play Red instead of the more showy Jeremiah.|Fresh
One of the most genius, visceral and truly transgressive genre films known in the last decade. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The audiovisual section is interesting and Nicolas Cage is acceptable, but this is not enough to compensate for the amount of excesses, whims and inconsistencies that the story presents. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Mandy is one hell of a wild ride at the cinema with its lush, fantastical visuals and its grizzly violence.|Fresh
With hypnotic red and purple drenched cinematography, animated fantasy sequences, and the most intense Nicolas Cage performance in history, Mandy is incredible.|Fresh
Cosmatos' style gets the better of him with this one, to the point where it melds together like flowing molasses.|Rotten
All the elements will be represented here as metaphor for the completeness of their bond. It's not subtle. Now's not the time for subtlety.|Fresh
Even though it's all too gut-wrenching and sunless, kudos to a fast-and-furious Cage, who returns from the dead with an insatiable appetite for vindictiveness.|Fresh
We are invested in this place and these people, and though the film might reach levels of cinematic dementedness we haven't seen in a decade, it never descends into farce or cheap laughs.|Fresh
Had Nicolas Cage not been in Mandy, this would've been cast aside without a second, third or thousandth thought.|Rotten
It shouldn't be overlooked how good Cage is.|Fresh
Mandy tries and sometimes succeeds to be the kind of movie you should only see after midnight, but a slow pace is fatal to grindhouse. The changes of emphasis and time that are so fearfully disorienting in Lynch are more like dead air here.|Rotten
Hyperstylised and ultraviolent, Mandy is an amped-up theological trip into pulp's purest quintessence|Fresh
Mandy can count itself as one of the best grindhouse films ever made.|Fresh
Set in 1983, the film may in some ways resemble an ultraviolent horror movie from those days, but its pastiching is enhanced both by parodic exaggeration and by moments of oddly deep tenderness.|Fresh
One for Cage completists only and even they may struggle.|Rotten
A dark, dotty and delirious Halloween treat.|Fresh
Panatos [combines] a fascination with heavy metal iconography, VHS horror nasties and a twisted video game logic into something at once familiar and entirely unlike anything you've previously experienced.|Fresh
Mandy sure is something.|Fresh
Cosmatos fires beyond the synth-scores and VHS-visuals of the new-80s genre wave, delivering a properly heavy, full-blooded actioner, with a lot more to say than you'd expect.|Fresh
You'll likely come to Mandy for crazy Nic Cage, but once watching, will fall in love with the pure, unadulterated psychedelic visuals, hypnotic score and uber-violence, the likes we've barely seen since the eighties.|Fresh
Naughty but niche.|Fresh
It's ludicrous, excessive and scuzzy. It rocks.|Fresh
Intermittently amusing, but not in a good way.|Rotten
Panos Costamos throws away the rule book for revenge movies and fashions a dream-like piece of cinematic carnage with Mandy.|Fresh
As an audiovisual experience, it's certainly entertaining, and perhaps even destined for cult success, but I'm not sure its metalhead aesthetic services much more than mood.|Fresh
It's a gore movie but its a bit kaleidoscopic.|Fresh
We have a one-of-a-kind actor on delightfully unhinged form... the film delights in letting Nicolas out of the Cage.|Fresh
This is very much a 2018 film, with all our era's horrors and inadequacies and injustice exposed, writ large and remedied only by a retreat into fantasy.|Fresh
Needless to say, Cage is utterly in his element.|Fresh
Fans of [Cage's] work will relish his extravagantly oddball performance as a dark avenger in this luridly overwrought horror movie.|Fresh
As enjoyable as Cage is here, the studied weirdness of Panos Cosmatos's sophomore feature is often as trying as it is transcendent.|Fresh
One of the best performances of Nicolas Cage's career, with blood, guts, and gore to boot.|Fresh
Nicolas Cage going postal on screen is now so passé it's become an internet meme but the actor has finally met his match with Mandy, a grindhouse movie even more bat-poop bananas than he is.|Fresh
The zany bi-product of Cage's addictive self-indulgence is that we get to see a committed and endowed artist apply his craft in nontraditional places.|Fresh
Nicolas Cage serves up horror awesome sauce in the psychotomimetic film from sensory overload filmmaker Panos Cosmatos.|Fresh
There really are some extraordinary scenes.|Fresh
With Cage in the lead role, the glorified grindhouse flick is sure to catch the attention of niche audiences.|Fresh
This is Nic Cage's raging, blood-soaked, psychedelic revenge inferno, and it's exactly as difficult to explain as that suggests. But also just as enticing.|Fresh
Dreamy, destructive, unfailingly compelling.|Fresh
Cosmatos harnesses the full transportive power of cinema for a psychedelia-infused horror that walks its treacherous path at a ponderous pace.|Fresh
A no-holds-barred ride into madness destined for a thousand midnight screenings.|Fresh
A lurid, psychosexual homage to 1980s horror that sees a wild-eyed Nicolas Cage give perhaps his most unhinged performance to date.|Fresh
Of course, the film belongs to Cage, who dives in with full-throated emotion.|Fresh
Cosmatos has crafted a film that is all at once comical, brutal, heartbreaking, sweet, and also nightmare fuel.|Fresh
Somewhere between a prog album cover come to life and a metal album cover come to life, and subscribes to both genre's artistic tendency towards maximalism.|Fresh
This is how cinema is made, with this mixture of realism and transcendence, with the magical power that makes the cinematography, editing and narration feel so distorted, but in a united way. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cage is at his most unhinged here without degenerating into self-parody in a film that's part B-movie horror, part phantasmagoric fantasy.|Fresh
"For all its spellbinding tableaux and accomplished production design, ""Mandy's"" most valuable asset is Cage, who spends half the movie with his face covered in blood that, appropriately enough, looks more like war paint."|Fresh
There is a lot of blood in Mandy, as well as chainsaws, burning buildings, drugs and even animation, but it's never shallow or stale.|Fresh
Canadian director [Panos] Cosmatos doesn't just push the boat out in Mandy, he mobilizes the whole fleet, on a brutally aggressive war footing.|Fresh
In the end, Mandy is either extremely for you or it is extremely not; I feel bad for you if you're in the latter camp.|Fresh
Sensitive and sense-shattering, Mandy isn't simply a masterpiece: it's two for the price of one.|Fresh
It's a wonderful blend of art house aesthetic with mainstream sensibilities. A rich film that leaves you excited, but also mentally engaged.|Fresh
It can be a bracing watch if you're game and serves as a reminder that Cage can still deliver the gonzo goods as an actor...|Fresh
While you'll enjoy Cage's performance, you'll get lost in the marvelous movie that surrounds him.|Fresh
Every once in a while Cage will team up with a visionary director who knows how to channel that relentless energy into something profound... Director Panos Cosmatos does just that.|Fresh
This midnight movie, this spiritual bastard child of a thousand drive-in flicks, ultimately takes its place in the halls of art. It's purple and inflamed, like a fireworks show or an abscess.|Fresh
Everything from the feature's colour-saturated visuals, to its ferocious score, to Cage's glorious performance all hits the mark.|Fresh
It's 90s Trapper Keeper The Movie... visually stunning... Bloody as s---.|Fresh
Both Riseborough and Cage give championship performances. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A slow-motion celebration of maximal filmmaking; design and performance amped up and slowed down - like doom metal music - so that you luxuriate in the aesthetic and endure the portentous dialogue.|Fresh
"It's like ""2001"" meets splatter gore."|Fresh
Available on demand, but you definitely want to see it on a big screen, and loud.|Fresh
Either you are one of the devoted or you're not. You won't know what camp you're in until you see it.|Fresh
It's safe to say you have never really seen anything like this, and won't again.|Fresh
Makes you realize how much deep physical and psychological weight Cage has to offer when he's unleashed with a script that has his back.|Fresh
While Mandy doesn't offer anything new to the vengeance genre in terms of plot, it has an immense amount of visual imagery and symbolism that drives the film beyond your typical revenge porn into a fantastical thesis of psychosis.|Fresh
Mandy is going to live as a cult classic. It won't be for everyone, but many will enjoy it for its chimerical cadence.|Fresh
Mandy is, like that weird little goblin, a thing of demon energy and murderous concentration, eager to get on with the business of messing with you. It's one of the wildest, weirdest, most exciting movies of the year.|Fresh
Even if you're not a heavy-metal fan, one can't help but love how Cosmatos turns an entire genre of music into a mode of filmmaking, and how Cage turns all of that into an authentically raw, vulnerable, blood-soaked performance.|Fresh
This is an aggressive and violent movie yet it is also one that unabashedly wears its heart on its Black Sabbath t-shirt-wearing sleeve.|Fresh
Only midnight movie completists need apply.|Rotten
Imagery saturated in red (everything in this world seems blood-soaked) abets the stroboscopic forward motion Costmatos creates as does Cage's performance.|Fresh
Cage treats Red Miller not as a knocked-out, one-note vigilante, but as a full-blown Shakespearean figure filled with vengeful wrath.|Fresh
When it does eventually kick into high gear, Cage delivers the loudness and craziness his fans have come to expect.|Fresh
Weird in a way you either will accept instantly or it will drive you nuts. But as an experience? As an immersive, 2-hour drug-induced dream dreamt to a synthy soundtrack while laying on a bed of dewy grass? It's a masterpiece.|Fresh
Beautifully-designed, genius and very self-aware.|Fresh
If you're a fan of Cage, then this is a bloody good one to see him go bonkers.|Fresh
Ultimately, the lack of a coherent script hampers the movie in a number of ways, largely overshadowing some very interesting direction ... leave this one to stream.|Rotten
Mandy has a little more beauty and hope under all that blood and gore.|Fresh
Cage unhinged, yes. A throwback to the Manson-inspired, death cult grindhouse movies of the '70s, but not a very good one.|Rotten
The pace remains languid and precise, but the violence is relentless and gruesome, a spectacle of blood, dirt, and the most ridiculous weapons imaginable. It's suitably nutty, and it's likely to give the film a level of notoriety for years to come.|Fresh
Mandy has echoes of Hollywood stuff that's out now like The Predator and Peppermint, but its compelling strangeness gives it a power that those others can't hope to match. Plus, y'know, chainsaws.|Fresh
Mandy is the real deal. It's a disturbing, expressionist horror picture.|Fresh
A revenge tale so wildly extravagant that it seems positively deranged...For Midnight Movie types, 'Mandy' will be an answer to their prayers; for everybody else, Cosmatos' flamboyant fever-dream will be an excruciating, stomach-churning nightmare.|Rotten
A unique and entertaining dive into the trippy and the brutal.|Fresh
It's not for all tastes, but provides a treat for genre buffs.|Fresh
You've never seen anything quite like Mandy, even if its DNA is assembled in patchwork from so many pulpy, D&D friendly novels of the '70s and '80s.|Fresh
[Nicolas Cage] finally meets a director that's as willing to go as over-the-top as he is.|Fresh
An exercise in lyrically lurid excess... It does go over-the-top but it at least does so with the kind of heedless abandon that too few movies are even willing to attempt these days, let alone pull off as well as this one does.|Fresh
While Mandy works well as Midnight movie shlock, the film's mournful tone and obsessive style go beyond the genre requirements. Cosmatos has preserved the pop culture of his childhood in a jelly of intense emotions.|Fresh
A revenge movie of demolishing beauty and sustained rapture that I cannot help but love... Easily the most sustained mosaic of visceral action and consummate world-building I've seen since Mad Max: Fury Road.|Fresh
Cage is heartbreaking, channeling primordial craziness not because that is what he does now, what he is to our stupid culture, but because he is a full-bodied actor who needs to be pulled back from the parodic void.|Fresh
And while the subject matter is admittedly bleak and stark, Cosmatos is savvy enough to not take the material too seriously, imbuing the film with plenty of bilious humour.|Fresh
[A] fever dream... with visuals that suggest that the characters, the filmmakers, or perhaps the audience are having their perceptions altered by drugs.|Fresh
Mandy herself is half oneiric goddess, half vulnerable loner, and Riseborough possesses a fascinating spookiness that makes you forget she's a cliché.|Fresh
Walks a fine line between the cool and the ridiculous, and then finally erases the line.|Fresh
...an art-house exercise in often infuriating self-indulgence.|Rotten
Mandy is an instant cult classic. ... This is a rock opera as envisioned by the lords of hell.|Fresh
For those who think nothing of staying up past midnight to devour the strange and fantastic, it hits the sweetest of spots.|Fresh
If revenge films are a dime a dozen, then Mandy cost a bunch of dimes. The plot is straightforward but visually, aurally, symbolically, it's a heavy motion picture that may be too much for some audiences to handle.|Fresh
Even with the radical shift between its two halves, the film presents a cohesive vision, if only on account of how utterly strange it is.|Fresh
The most disturbing part is that Mandy is alluring regardless. Every frame of its picture and every note of its score bleeds anger or sorrow, but even when it simmers with these ostensibly negative, destructive emotions, it does so melodiously.|Fresh
Mandy borrows from a (Panos) cosmology of profane influences-stoner metal, '80s trash cinema, bad drugs-and fashions them into something that feels sacred.|Fresh
Too bad that heart gets sacrificed to Cosmatos' over-the-top madness.|Rotten
There's gore galore, but even, or maybe especially, at its most pitch-black, nightmare moments, Mandy beats with a heart of genuine love, the only emotion that can make a human being hate so very terribly much.|Fresh
Pretty cool, though I'm not sure the film has a life beyond a cult object. The slow pacing works against the suffocating intensity...|Fresh
Displays some decent visual gimmickry but shoots for mystical and epic but ultimately feels laboured and pointless.|Rotten
Mandy embodies the spirit of heavy metal more than any other movie in recent memory.|Fresh
Mandy shouldn't be written off as just another gory horror flick. It's a truly singular experience: a stylized-to-the-hilt journey into the circles of hell. It's impossible to shake.|Fresh
Mandy isn't for everyone. But for those it is for? It's a hell of a thing.|Fresh
"""Mandy"" is specialized work, but it's a doozy, cutting through the cosmic cream with nightmare realms, monstrous encounters, and a path of revenge that literally tears people apart."|Fresh
This film is a fusion of kitsch and pulp, underscored with a genuine spiritual yearning.|Fresh
When Cosmatos' crushed and oppressive visuals combine with an equally crushing, unhinged Cage performance, you have a near perfect concoction-a Cage-tastic combustion.|Fresh
It's the kind of extreme moviegoing experience made for midnight-movie cult worship.|Fresh
At its core, despite being unreservedly far out, Mandy is a pretty conventional revenge story. But Cosmatos has taken those conventions back to their primordial state, fashioning something that goes deeper than the archetypal. It's downright mythical.|Fresh
Mandy throws enough visionary strangeness on the screen to dwarf even Nicolas Cage in full freakout mode.|Fresh
Cage unleashed, unchecked and unstoppable.|Fresh
If it occurs to you as [Cage] slashes, shoots and screams his way to the climax (pausing only to snort a giant heap of coke off a shard of broken mirror) that you are witnessing his finest hour, you'd be dead right.|Fresh
Cage loses it in a bloody, druggy, superbly crafted revenge thriller. Astonishing.|Fresh
Though its deliberate pace might deter some Nicolas Cage devotees, this face-melting genre-bender is a persuasive argument for cinema as pure atmosphere.|Fresh
"[Shows] mankind's penchant for false saviors preaching hate instead of understanding. Satan's the hero, a final bastion for individuality in ""pious"" world killing to conform.﻿"|Fresh
The movie isn't just set in 1983, it feels like a memory of something you might have watched that year on late night cable after your parents fell asleep.|Fresh
A mesmerizing concept album of B-movie artistry where the style is the substance.|Fresh
Panos Cosmatos's film is a profoundly violent and weirdly moving poem of male alienation.|Fresh
Mandy is a midnight movie masterpiece that delivers on everything you want and more. A genre-defining work of insane brilliance.|Fresh
The film is about nothing-aside, of course, from the sight of a blood-spattered Nicolas Cage gritting his teeth as he rams the sharpened knob of his ax down someone's throat.|Fresh
Mandy may feel like a cult movie that assumes it already has a prefab cult...as a star vehicle, however, this film is fully scraping at the door.|Fresh
Cage is known for his erratic, unhinged roles. So if you love seeing him at his nuttiest, get ready for his craziest role yet.|Fresh
Cage has won an Oscar, but this is the role he's waited the entirety of his career's second act to play.|Fresh
One of the most mind blowing, mind f--k, horror revenge pictures of the year.|Fresh
Panos Cosmatos' drug-fueled revenge flick is a heavy metal giallo with imagery seemingly inspired by a custom van mural painted by Frank Frazetta and a Nicolas Cage performance for the ages.|Fresh
Nicolas Cage is my new God|Fresh
If you enjoy trippy dark fantasy films and volumes of violence presented with phantasmagoric glee, then this flick is definitely worth a look.|Fresh
So viscerally intense that you'll start to feel like you've fallen into a Bosch painting and your only guide through the madness is a wild-eyed, blood-drenched Nicolas Cage.|Fresh
It's unconventional and provocative, but with such a powerfully invigorating narration and clear passion between the lines, Mandy feels like an explosive liberation.|Fresh
Rarely have a movie and its star felt as perfectly matched as this violent tale of abduction, destruction and revenge, and the man tasked with traversing its lurid depths.|Fresh
It takes some patience to watch MANDY because of its setup, but I promise you, once Cage goes uncaged, you'll get your money's worth.|Fresh
...a film that not only can contain Nicolas Cage but also work as a curious fusion of modern-day horror tropes, the operatic tone of Wagner's Ring cycle and epically primal and elemental cosmic dread. It's a doozy.|Fresh
The man who never turns down an opportunity to be a total madman, Cage is totally bonkers here in the best possible way - a psychologically imbalanced anchor in a cosmically nightmarish world.|Fresh
Panos Cosmatos' Mandy...featur[es] some of the best Cage-isms in years.|Fresh
Those still suffering from withdrawal symptoms from the end of David Lynch's epic Twin Peaks revival last year - the cure has been found.|Fresh
When body horror is so artful and justified, its silliness only makes it more uplifting.|Fresh
After years in the wilderness, Nicolas Cage has his swagger back.|Fresh
The film never abandons its love of the fantastic.|Fresh
Cosmatos has crafted a mind-melting genre orgy of cosmic proportions that's ridiculously fun.|Fresh
Cosmatos' vision is appropriately cosmic and apocalyptic, although its distended contemplations in the first hour can be somewhat trying, even suffocating.|Rotten
It's not nuanced, but it needn't be: watch Mandy with an enthusiastic audience and it's impossible not to be swept away in the carnage.|Fresh
The most interesting part of [Mandy] is not what counts but how, from a few elements, it's able to create a hypnotic atmosphere. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Mandy is noise and fury, and there lies its magnificence and its problems. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Mandy exists in its own supremely unnerving horror dimension.|Fresh
"""Mandy"" is not for everyone, but for a willing and engaged audience this is a rare artifact, a warped ""hearts of darkness"" journey into loss and out the other side."|Fresh
Mandy might not be everyone's idea of a satisfying nightcap, but this surrealistic revenge flick will likely earn a loyal following of its own.|Fresh
Cosmatos' ability to put us in Red's head - overwhelmed at first with pain and fury, then saturated by the strange drugs he for some reason feels compelled to try - make this much more than the usual exercise in vicarious bloodshed.|Fresh
Mandy is bravura batshittery|Fresh
[Nicholas Cage] works precisely because there is a great actor underneath it all and because he does tap into something so ferocious that other people wouldn't dare to touch.|Fresh
Mandy is heartbreaking: There's one lengthy close-up right around the middle when we see the light literally go out from Cage's eyes.|Fresh
There are so many reasons why I loved Mandy, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface here, but to be honest, so many of those things were genuine surprises for me as I was watching it, and I feel like that's the best way for anyone to see it.|Fresh
Mandy is an intense two hours.|Fresh
Mandy is a totally uncompromising vision from a singular filmmaker - a pulsing, twisted descent into heavy metal vengeance that must be seen to be believed.|Fresh
Mandy combines the most absurd aesthetic excesses of '70s and '80s horror films with the most absurd thespian excesses of Nicolas Cage, and the movie works best if you're already fond - or at least tolerant - of both.|Fresh
Fans of gleefully violent action-horror must suffice with only a few choice annual titles. Mandy ranks high among that ilk, gory enough to please those needs while experimental and interesting enough to satisfy others.|Fresh
For all of the violence on display [Panos] Cosmatos and [Nicholas] Cage combine to make a movie that is actually pretty funny, if you have a seriously sick, demented sense of humor.|Fresh
"As if its sole goal was to take the heavyweight title of Nicolas Cage's Craziest Movie Ever, ""Mandy"" exhibits what Shakespeare called ""vaulting ambition"" in producing the nuttiest ways for Cage to get into one phantasmagorical showdown after the next."|Fresh
[Panos] Cosmatos' vision is an all-encompassing of pure psychosis. By easing us into this world through Red and Mandy's touching and unconventional romance, it makes the pay-off to come that much greater.|Fresh
"""Mandy"" is an acid trip that at times you'll wish would just stop. But when you ride it out, gives you the payoff of a 100% insane Nicolas Cage performance."|Fresh
For years, [Nicholas Cage] has swung wildly in search of gonzo material; at long last, he's found a movie willing to match his crazed intentions.|Fresh
The film is lush and gorgeous even at its ugliest, and the further it goes, the deeper the mark it's trying to make on you.|Fresh
Low-key weirdness and high-energy intensity may not seem like an ideal match, but the pairing of director Panos Cosmatos and Nicolas Cage sees both talents giving everything they've got into a uniquely memorable collaboration.|Fresh
The last forty minutes of MANDY ranks as maybe Cage's most hardcore trip into the dark side yet.|Fresh
Were scientists to engineer an uncut, 100-proof cult sensation, it would probably look, sound, and kick like this.|Fresh
Anyone with a taste for Nicolas Cage in full gonzo mode should get some fun out of its fever-dream progress.|Fresh
Mandy is destined to become one of the quintessential cult movies, and a sort of arcane codeword amongst devotees of weird and wild films.|Fresh
