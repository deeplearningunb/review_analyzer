Its images of extraordinary violence in (mostly) ordinary circumstances is deeply unsettling, and it lingers in your mind and skin long after the credits roll.|Fresh
GREEN ROOM keeps packing on the layers of pure visceral joy. Saulnier has made a masterwork that excites and stimulates from beginning to end.|Fresh
More grizzly than the average action film and more nuanced and meticulous than the usual horror film.|Fresh
Green Room is a ruthless tale of savagery that will excite and shock audiences. What takes this film to the next level is that it has all these traits while also having substance.|Fresh
One of the most creatively creepy film experiences of recent times.|Fresh
Darkly comic and even touching at times, Green Room is a solid horror movie that colors outside the genre lines.|Fresh
Writer/Director Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room understands that DIY anarchist punk ethics are in constant danger from a systematic rule.|Fresh
Saulnier's eye for the details of band life, from the perfectly dingy club to the roles each member plays off stage as well as on, gives Green Room the sense of accuracy, of believability, that makes its claustrophobic struggles all the more tense.|Fresh
"""Green Room"" is a fun horror thriller, with a disturbing group of bad guys preying upon punk rock kids who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's bloody and not for the faint of heart, but definitely worth the watch."|Fresh

His script flirts with coupledom and then rejects it, as a nihilist punk horror movie should.|Fresh
Patrick Stewart is flat-out awesome in the role of a Neo-Nazi, and will undoubtedly be the selling point of Green Room|Fresh
Stewart is splendidly sinister as the club owner, while writer-director Jeremy Saulnier certainly knows what he's doing.|Fresh
... for those willing to give it a shot it offers a rare experience, combining the kind of meticulous craftsmanship we expect from arthouse cinema with the hocking, terrifying violence we associate with exploitation films.|Fresh
What happens in Green Room ain't right, but you'll find that you are in bloody good hands.|Fresh
It's fast, bloody, and, when you least expect it, hilarious.|Fresh
A movie whose most horrifying concept is that these days, it doesn't seem that far fetched.|Fresh
Green Room may be perceived as needlessly and excessively nihilistic; instead, Saulnier's film is gloriously unpredictable, a unique thriller that rips up the rule book whilst paying deliriously gory tribute to it.|Fresh
These days, it seems like there's enough darkness in the world without turning to the cinema for a steady diet of mutilation and pain.|Rotten
A movie that will get your heart thumping, and your adrenaline rushing.|Fresh
For a film that repeatedly questions the legitimacy of its punk rocker heroes, Saulnier's second salvo is the real deal: a ferocious siege movie that cuts straight to the bone.|Fresh
The setting is claustrophobia inducing, the shooting artful, and the tension unremitting.|Fresh
Green Room is a strangely involving as any movie contained by the bloody hillbilly-attack genre.|Fresh
The dialogue is flat, the plot lacks coherence and the characters are underwritten.|Rotten
I understand the appeal of vicarious brushes with death, I just don't share it.|Rotten
Saulnier evidently wanted to provide audiences with a bad trip, but sometimes a bad trip is indistinguishable from a backward step, or simply a dead end.|Rotten
For a mess, it's lively. But from Saulnier we'd have liked something more.|Fresh
The performances are good, and the punks' squabbles and mistakes are an extra source of unpredictability in the film's piecemeal but generally effective series of bloodthirsty tussles.|Fresh
Insists that we deal, directly, with the reality that people capable of the most barbaric awfulness are just as human as you or I.|Fresh
A disturbing and chaotic tale of class warfare and cold, calculating evil.|Fresh
As wild and violent as Sid Vicious was. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Green Room is a memorable thriller, and I can't wait to see what Saulnier does next.|Fresh
Tense, taut and brutal ...|Fresh
In Green Room, Jeremy Saulnier masterfully creates a brutal and relentless thriller that deftly subverts expectations while continually raising the stakes for everyone involved-two earmarks of great storytelling.|Fresh
A savage little siege movie, but one that's filled with convincing character details.|Fresh
Its go-for-broke horror aesthetic a real world cavalcade of terror that had me noticeably shaking long after the film itself had come to an end.|Fresh
Green Room is an electrifying genre-bending blast.|Fresh
Saulnier an essential filmmaker to follow.|Fresh
Fists up, knives out and guns cocked -- one of the films of 2016.|Fresh
Green Room is unsparing in its brutality and unsentimental in its treatment of its protagonists. When the violence finally gets going, things get ugly, quickly.|Fresh
Green Room is top notch entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A gore festival in the spirit of the B-movies made by John Carpenter, Walter Hill and early Peter Jackson. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
If his last film was powerful but lacked elegance and efficiency, all of that has been fixed for Green Room. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In the first minutes you can tell there's energy, pleasure, rage and mistery. This is the work of a director that know how to make you feel something. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A violent exercise in tension and thrills.|Fresh
Pulsates on the collision of youth and violence with unrelenting execution of slasher/siege elements.|Fresh
The setup is straight out of an exploitation film, but the thrills aren't cheap, and there are no plot twists for twists' sake. The action is potent and shocking.|Fresh
Rarely has a film captured the terror of imminent bloodshed with this kind of frenzied, animalistic intensity.|Fresh
As a survival tale with wickedly nasty violence and pitch-black humour, Green Room is a red hot success.|Fresh
Saulnier revels in the primal nastiness of what the will to live looks like in the most dire of circumstances while also infusing the film with a level of visual artistry and black humor that suggests he is capable of much more.|Fresh
Where Blue Ruin announced Saulnier, Green Room is his career breakthrough.|Fresh
Saulnier's quiet dynamic ratchets up the tension before bursts of horror-like mayhem make clear that they are fighting merely to stay alive, not to make a point.|Fresh
"Joins the canon of ""under siege"" movies ... not with louder bangs, scarier invaders or more bloodshed but with originality, wit and subversion."|Fresh
The epitome of movie rock and roll.|Fresh
Naturally, the nightmare gets out of hand by the finale and the body-count is high, but getting there is devilish fun.|Fresh
...a controlled affair...|Fresh
Saulnier delivers relentless, foot-to-the-floor thrills worthy of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13.|Fresh
An intense siege movie that gives familiar tropes a blistering makeover courtesy of a precision-engineered plot, a thorough understanding of the world in which it's set and a gnarly and uncompromising approach to violence.|Fresh
How can you resist a film that, metaphorically, throws Simon & Garfunkel, Fugazi and Slayer into the same moshpit?|Fresh
"Smartly cast, Stewart brings an almost Shakespearean edge to the drama, delivering lines such as ""all is for nought"" in the manner of a theatrical king surveying the devastation of a five-act tragedy."|Fresh
Like being trapped in a mosh pit full of demented punk rockers, Green Room will kick your ass, leaving you beaten, changed and a little bit traumatised. You'll have had a hell of a time, though.|Fresh
Green Room is one of those rare horror movies that actually gets better rather than worse as it proceeds.|Fresh
Saulnier's undoubted skills as a director just about outweigh his fondness for gore.|Fresh
Green Room is a nasty, cold-hearted, claustrophobic film with moments of gratuitous violence and sick comedy. I liked it much more than Almost Famous.|Fresh
In its best moments Green Room reminds you of the sweaty, tightly controlled tension that John Carpenter achieved in early films like Assault On Precinct 13.|Fresh
|Fresh
While Green Room goes slightly daft towards the end, the brutality and adrenaline you experience along the way more than make up for it.|Fresh
Destined to become a Friday night favourite.|Fresh
The contrast between the pastoral setting and shocking blood-letting creates lots of breathless tension, putting Green Room in good company with down-and-dirty siege flicks like Assault on Precinct 13 and especially Straw Dogs.|Fresh
[A] dourly aggressive, in-your-face thriller.|Rotten
A pulverising piece of Seventies-style grindhouse exploitation, stitched together from the body parts of John Boorman's classic Deliverance and John Carpenter's siege thriller Assault on Precinct 13.|Fresh
This is a powerhouse piece of indie cinema: tense, gripping, intelligent and gut wrenchingly violent.|Fresh
For all the shock value of the explicit gore, the horror isn't the kind that lingers. Still, it's fun while it lasts -- that is, presuming you have a reasonably morbid idea of fun.|Fresh
Nasty, nerve-wracking and not for the squeamish.|Fresh
A grueling experience, viscerally suspenseful, inspiring in me a mighty clench in my seat.|Fresh
It's all put together with great skill, but never quite manages to deliver more than its modest, stripped-back story will allow.|Fresh
"""Green Room"" is harrowing, but it lacks humor. Fans of extreme violence and gore will be sated."|Fresh
Saulnier gets props for creating a claustrophobic horror film that delivers some hardcore goods. It builds tension well and doesn't flinch from effective gore.|Fresh
Intense but generally unimaginative.|Fresh
The most hardcore film of the year, Green Room, is 95 minutes of pure, unbridled Mosh Pit Cinema.|Fresh
It's a zombie movie - without zombies. Instead, Jeremy Saulnier's follow-up to Blue Ruin, his breakout piece of hillbilly genius, features a different brand of walking dead: neo-Nazi skinheads.|Fresh
Foregrounds the anti-urban racial isolationism implicit to the inbred rural killer clans of 'Chain Saw' and the like...|Fresh
Short on depth but long on visceral thrills, it's Old Testament moviemaking, with the adage about an eye for an eye expanding to also include arms, legs, torsos and, once killer dogs are introduced, even jugulars.|Fresh
Jeremy Saulnier's 'punks vs. Nazis' film is thrilling, visceral, and intense, including a wicked performance by Patrick Stewart.|Fresh
A lot of movies get under your skin; Green Room carves it off the bone.|Fresh
Perhaps Green Room is part of a conspiracy to keep gullible California slackers from moving up the coast.|Fresh
Influenced by exploitation movies of the 1970s (and punk music of the 1980s), this horror-thriller is rooted in a gripping, grisly kind of realism.|Fresh
"""Just an ugly, ugly film, in more ways than one"" (Splice Today)"|Rotten
"""Green Room"" is a violent, at times, thought-provoking addition to the emerging hipster tough sub-genre of films."|Fresh
When is a tense, claustrophobic chiller a bit of a letdown? When it's from the director behind the best movie sleeper of the past five years.|Fresh
Green Room will sometimes make you flinch, but it will never leave you uninterested.|Fresh
Green Room launches you into this grungy world of punk music filled with Nazis and fuses it with the viciousness found in The Grey along with the dilapidated ambiance of SLC Punk for an experience that is terrifically unforgettable.|Fresh
The violence is intense and visceral. And while it may be a familiar formula, Saulnier's cast is top-notch, his writing is sharp, and it isn't long before you realize that no one's survival is guaranteed.|Fresh
Saulnier crafts a gruesome setup as simple as is it inevitable.|Fresh
The real treat is watching the classically trained Stewart, whose harrowing performance gives this raw, edgy, awesomely impressive, little hard-hitting punk-rock movie even more of a visceral kick.|Fresh
Bloody violence and a shouty soundtrack make this a grisly DIY treat.|Fresh
[Saulnier does] everything right: the cast, the music, the editing, the way he leads you one way and then clobbers you (and some of his ill-fated characters) when you (and they) are least expecting it.|Fresh
The production doesn't offer much in the way of originality but it's a tense 90-minute ride that will result in elevated pulses, increased respiration, and white knuckles.|Fresh
Green Room is a relentless thriller|Fresh
"""Green Room"" sustains a bleak intensity unrivaled in recent thrillers - or horror movies, for that matter -- that gains potency from its pure plausibility."|Fresh
[An] intelligent, mordantly funny, unrelenting siege thriller.|Fresh
We can't ask for more from this genre, and we often get much less.|Fresh
Jeremy Saulnier's little genre gem is simply told and smartly executed, with a little bit of everything, from snarling dogs to bloody murder to the innate fear evoked by the backwoods.|Fresh
"Fear brings out the truth, even in would-be punks. And there is a lot of fear in ""Green Room."""|Fresh
Sualnier tucks genuine mysteries into the plot, but gives a sly wink to genre tropes like don't-go-there basements as he keeps you on edge and guessing.|Fresh
Compared to Saulnier's superior 'Blue Ruin,' this is a bit of a disappointment... another violent thriller, but compared to the former film it's curiously simple in terms of narrative, and the director's solemn approach works less effectively as a result.|Rotten
Green Room has a raw, unflinching spirit to it - one that's always exciting to watch, despite the brutality of it all.|Fresh
[Director] Saulnier elevates the ordinary into a tense game of punk rock cat-and-mouse that's only leavened slightly by a dark sense of humor.|Fresh
A tense thriller you won't want to miss.|Fresh
Every edit, camera movement and line of dialogue in the movie propels it toward its inevitable bloody end.|Fresh
a cinematic text book on how to make such a film|Fresh
The movie viciously transforms from a semi-hokey portrayal of a struggling punk band to a gritty survival-horror flick that keeps you transfixed till the bitter end.|Fresh
Genre fans will appreciate the craft and intelligence with which Saulnier's assembled his movie -- when they're not digging their nails into their thighs.|Fresh
Dizzyingly crafted, shocking from start to finish. It's also a wonderful reminder of Saulnier's developing talents and his ability to summon incredible tension.|Fresh
Even if the foundation of Saulnier's film feels familiar and the plot trips itself up unecessarily, it is a thoroughly satisfying -- though thoroughly violent -- thrill ride.|Fresh
"Punk rock is all about catharsis, but ""Green Room"" is a masterpiece of sustained tension, keeping viewers twisting in their seats as they wonder where the next threat will come from and how the Ain't Rights will survive."|Fresh
Saulnier's script unfolds with airtight logic and tick-tock tension, and his direction is forceful yet efficient.|Fresh
...soulful exploitation cinema.|Fresh
Welcome to the spooky, ultra-violent world of writer-director Jeremy Saulnier, as he gets his John Carpenter on by sending his plucky group of actors into a bloody game of last man (or woman) standing.|Fresh
Although this film's subject matter may be scruffy and disreputable, Green Room does engage ideas about trust and cooperation and improvisational thinking. All of which should put you near the edge of your seat as you watch this gripping thriller.|Fresh
This smart, stomach-turning look at what happens when you find yourself way over your head will go down as a well-deserved, punk rock classic.|Fresh
Remarkably ambitious and anxiously taut from its opening shots to its closing, the success of Green Room isn't found in its jump scares or gore (although both are plentiful) but in its realistic approach to both.|Fresh
Blue Ruin, Green Room? They're both bloodbaths. Jeremy Saulnier is breakout splatter-movie auteur. Stewart is terrifying.|Fresh
Relentlessly primal|Fresh
Expertly crafted cold-sweat terror.... an intense, explosive nightmare.|Fresh
Just might be the kind of punk horror movie you never knew you always wanted, catalyzing disparate elements into a heady, bloody, loud stew of horror macerated with hardcore.|Fresh
"The setup is as elemental as a campfire story but ""Green Room"" dresses it anew."|Fresh
Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room is a ferocious, relentless thriller...|Fresh
Saulnier gave us the sharply detailed, offbeat art house thriller Blue Ruin in 2013. Here, he replaces complex character motivation with simple survival instincts, and winds up in a room far more red than green.|Rotten
This is one smart chiller.|Fresh
A riotous, rough-hewn and rousing punk reinvention of '70s-style grindhouse exploitation-with-a-brain-cinema.|Fresh
"Anyone looking for the ferocious originality, and unexpected humanity, of ""Blue Ruin"" will be disappointed by Saulnier's uninspired cover version of a song we all know."|Rotten
The characters are picked off in predictable order, and a neo-Nazi angle leads to a dead end. Patrick Stewart is miscast as the skinheads' leader, his theatricality clashing with the other actors' realism.|Rotten
One of the most brutal, visceral films to come along in quite some time.|Fresh
Even when the movie is a challenge to follow, the plot is propulsive, and the tone is right.|Fresh
About as thrilling as a fried grasshopper canapé.|Rotten
"""Green Room"" is one nasty piece of work. And I mean that in a good way."|Fresh
Saulnier doesn't shy away from some teeth-clenching, peek-through-the-fingers, savagery, but the film excels in how he's laid out his game.|Fresh
Gathers up [Blue Ruin's] earlier promise and just goes sick with it, taking an intentionally stripped-down premise and jacking it up to ferocious speeds.|Fresh
Saulnier wears influence lightly, not limited to Night of the Living Dead, Assault on Precinct 13, Die Hard and Straw Dogs.|Fresh
an extended knife-twist at a screw-turning pace|Fresh
Somewhere in its black little heart, it has something interesting to say about human resiliency and the reckless moral code of youth. And at just over 90 minutes, it never overstays its welcome.|Fresh
One screenplay riff, on the taking of good advice, is piquantly memorable, but Saulnier's clever methods are insubstantial and the movie's stakes, though mortal, seem slight.|Rotten
Green Room is more than just a torture porn film; it's a hardcore punk show.|Fresh
A lack of character depth and narrative surprise renders it a well-acted genre exercise.|Rotten
Green Room proves to be an exquisitely crafted love letter to John Carpenter, and the rare horror ensemble that gives as much care to the villains as to the victims.|Fresh
"Totally brilliant. Like an episode of ""The Walking Dead"" directed by Akira Kurosawa or Sam Peckinpah."|Fresh
A total and abject cop-out, artfully composed and utterly comatose.|Rotten
A throaty, thrashing, spit-slinging punk tune belted through an invasion movie microphone at max volume. It's nasty-and near-perfect.|Fresh
Saulnier has his finger on the pulse of the audience throughout the entire flick, and his understanding of genre filmmaking is a force to be reckoned with.|Fresh
Green Room is a smart, sick and suspenseful thriller that is perfect for a night out with friends.|Fresh
Unlike other genre directors, Saulnier takes his time setting things up, so we get to know the characters first - particularly Alia Shawkat as Sam, and Anton Yelchin as Pat.|Fresh
Bloody good...|Fresh
"""Green Room"" may be too schematic to fully capture the essence of its characters' groddy milieu, but it's also economically paced, and gorgeous."|Fresh
"A shabby white-power outpost in the Oregon boondocks becomes a grim last stand for a nomadic band of college-age punk rockers in the demonically gripping ""Green Room."""|Fresh
Mr. Saulnier certainly could have done more, but he succeeds perfectly well within the limited terms he has set for himself.|Fresh
"The film's ""punk versus skinheads"" hook gives it the quality of a blood-spattered graphic novel, but there's a sophistication to the writing and direction that transcends brute conflict."|Fresh
A potent thriller/horror hybrid and further proof of Jeremy Saulnier's directing prowess, even if its ending can't quite match the preceding excellence.|Fresh
Green Room is way more than crass exploitation. It's a B movie with an art-house core.|Fresh
Green Room is a vicious, grisly, suspenseful roller-coaster ride with a razor-sharp safety bar, and you are going to get cut.|Fresh
It's a genre picture and also a sly dissection of a genre picture.|Fresh
Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room is a white-knuckle thriller that flirts with becoming something approaching a comedy of errors.|Fresh
Taut and brutal, the movie reminds us that Saulnier is a gifted storyteller, able to establish character histories and interpersonal relations with the briefest of exchanges or gestures.|Fresh
It's terrifying how little modulation it takes for [Stewart's] comforting baritone to convey utter hopelessness.|Fresh
The 95 minutes are so enthralling and fly by so fast that it's got a rollercoaster effect. It's hard to come down from the adrenaline rush and think of anything else besides experiencing it again.|Fresh
This never comes close to boring, and contains more than enough memorable, cover-your-eyes nastiness to please the late-night crowd.|Fresh
Although Green Room has more scope and technical ambition than Blue Ruin, artistically it takes a giant step back.|Rotten
Saulnier gets lots of laughs and builds plenty of suspense in this effective (if gory) little tongue-in-cheek sleeper.|Fresh
Good lord is it tense.|Fresh
Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room is an impeccably crafted cinematic torture machine - in the best possible way.|Fresh
The film has a smart grasp on the hand-to-mouth lifestyle of road dogs, and a stronger sense of the lingo and sweatbox atmosphere of divey punk bars.|Fresh
The lean, mean Green Room stands as one of the best B-movie genre exercises in many years -- whether it adds up to anything more than just a brilliantly done rollercoaster ride is more debatable.|Fresh
Green Room is a gloriously grisly free-for-all, a redneck Diehard meets Straw Dogs with an old school exploitation aesthetic that sacrifices depth for demented thrills.|Fresh
You can't have a siege thriller without a siege, and Green Room is certainly among the genre's finest examples.|Fresh
The outsized circumstances end up making it funnier, too -- the film has a kind of locked-jaw sardonic sense of humor that is the perfect counterbalance to its moody camerawork and soundtrack.|Fresh
Only a limited number of things can happen in this kind of movie, of course, but Saulnier manages pace, tone and storytelling so adroitly that you won't quite expect any of them to happen when they do, or even how.|Fresh
It's brilliant but unpleasant, but genius, but miserable, and so on and so forth.|Fresh
What makes Green Room more than just a giddy, gory slice of gonzo B-movie mayhem ... is both its ace cast and the vise-tightening mastery of the man pulling the strings behind the camera.|Fresh
Generates some serious stakes and maximum suspense.|Fresh
A slasher pic that fails on most levels: production values, music, dialogue, performance, clarity of purpose|Rotten
Good or bad depends on whether one cares to watch such raw hysterical darkness, and whether it is worth watching. Against the tide, this voice crying in the wilderness says, no, it isn't.|Rotten
The film is an unambiguous endorsement of violent revolt as the only effective response to such inhuman savagery.|Fresh
Jeremy Saulnier's wickedly entertaining follow-up to Blue Ruin makes a big impression by staying small.|Fresh
"A shock-rock bullet train of a thriller that's likely to grow in esteem even faster than ""Blue Ruin"" has. [Writer-director] Jeremy Saulnier has arrived."|Fresh
[In] Jeremy Saulnier's near-perfect nugget of a siege thriller...[g]raphic scenes of carnage are doled out sparingly but unflinchingly, while cinematographer Sean Porter gives each high-stakes encounter...a palpable sense of vintage nastiness.|Fresh
This is masterful film-making and Green Room doesn't pull any punches. In fact, it'll grab you by the throat and refuse to let go until the credits roll.|Fresh
Stylishly directed and impressively acted, this is a gripping, grisly, gory gift for genre fans. Saulnier's next film can't come soon enough.|Fresh
An adrenaline-driven nail-biter of a third feature from Jeremy Saulnier.|Fresh
Less psychological and more formulaic than his previous feature, this is still relentlessly entertaining.|Fresh
While Green Room features a number of ingeniously crafted set pieces, it quickly winds up as an excessive, borderline pornographic revelry in extreme violence.|Rotten
Saulnier has created a film as exhilarating as it is excruciating.|Fresh
With its tight, economic storytelling, Green Room keeps things simple and scary.|Fresh
"[Sundance 2016] A film of poisonous lineages and the evil that good men and beasts learn, ""Green Room"" has something more to say beyond being a bloodily decisive genre work."|Fresh
An incendiary performance from Patrick Stewart fuels a stunning film, not for the faint of heart.|Fresh
Visually and thematically Saulnier is treading on familiar ground, but he's one of the best at it right now.|Fresh
What makes Green Room's premise so thrilling is how much it lets these characters lead the action -- sometimes into dangerous dead ends.|Fresh
A siege film with believable characters & witty dialogue... shows regular folk just trying to get by in impossible circumstances. It also slyly exposes the low motives underlying some of the more extreme ideologies in America's culture wars.|Fresh
So nerve-shredding, it will make your whole body hurt.|Fresh
Like Blue Ruin, Green Room is both unflashy and brilliantly constructed.|Fresh
Blue Ruin's Jeremy Saulnier is back with a smart, savage, dryly funny horror flick that has something to say about all-too-human monsters. No spoilers!|Fresh
A meticulously morbid and deviously entertaining piece of low-budget/high-quality action filmmaking.|Fresh
Jeremy Saulnier has a special talent for making violence looks as uncomfortable as it really is, yet compelling you to want to see more.|Fresh
Green Room is a punishing masterpiece built on aggression, tension, and grimy punk-rock filmmaking, with a heavy emphasis on artistry and emotion.|Fresh
Jeremy Saulnier's disappointing followup to 2013's superb Blue Ruin...|Rotten
Like Blue Ruin before it, part of the beauty of Green Room is that it feints like it's going to be a festival indie before becoming a balls-to-the-wall action thriller that treats introspection like leprosy.|Fresh
Green Room is a relatively simple film on paper, but it never feels over-written or cheaply sensationalized. We feel like the choices being made are genuine, human and real.|Fresh
Incredibly tense action-thriller, with superb acting and several iconically grisly moments.|Fresh
Th[e] naturalistic Confederate Gothic atmosphere is the most distinctive element of the film, an effective if largely predictable nightmare (in a vindication-of-the-formula sort of way).|Fresh
Green Room proves playfully unpredictable to the very last frame. Perhaps the only thing more exciting than waiting to see what transpires is waiting to see what Saulnier does next.|Fresh
What begins as a nail-biting thriller effortlessly segues into carnage, replete with ripped throats and wounds that seek to redefine the word 'gaping'.|Fresh
There's also a thick vein of dark humour that runs through the film which never turns it into a comedy but keeps some of the nastier moments (and boy, are they nasty) from turning it into torture porn.|Fresh
Littered with clever dialogue, a beautifully constructed narrative, as well as moments that shift between the energizing and sheer terror, there are a slew of endearing qualities worth sifting through.|Fresh
This is a lean, undemanding popcorn movie and better for it.|Fresh
The result is an exciting, splattery, funny genre movie that somehow never once feels disposable, and one that should prove a midnight movie delight for some time to come.|Fresh
As action, it's niftily executed, the suspense neatly built, and the shocks expectedly surprising.|Fresh
Smart, scary and with a spurting vein of blood-soaked black humour.|Fresh
Characterization and emotional investment, however, are in disappointingly short supply, while crucial tension is permitted to dissipate in an anti-climactic final third.|Rotten
