Kogonada shows some promise, but the film is positively listless by the end, and fairly lacking in substance given the intelligentsia trappings and novel-like tone.|Rotten
Columbus is recommended to those interested in leisurely-paced, character-driven art house fare.|Fresh
Columbus demands audiences to give their full attention, yet this command is given in whispers, not shouts ... This is the architecture of human encounters.|Fresh
If you give the reins to Kogonada and exert a little effort yourself, Columbus will give you back ten times what you put into it.|Fresh
Kogonada creates a recurring juxtaposition between the axis of the dramaturgy (where narrative cinema nominally places the audience) and a more transcendent, detached position|Fresh
The story centers heavily around architecture, and Kogonada and cinematographer Elisha Christian, craft still-frames ... that feel like pieces of architecture themselves.|Fresh
Columbus is a fantastic directorial debut for Kogonada and a great showcase for its two leads, John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson. Features the best punch-dancing since Footloose.|Fresh
Cho is dependably good but it's Haley Lu Richardson who steal the show with a sublime performance.|Fresh
Columbus is a beautiful-looking but far too slow-moving art-house drama that seeks to combine the emotional trauma of separation with, er, a celebration of modernist architecture.|Rotten
Both Cho and Richardson are unforgettable with an easy chemistry that starts in guarded awkwardness before thawing to reveal warmth only an empathetic stranger could provide.|Fresh

Gentle, quietly knowing and with lovely performances from the two leads, plus Parker Posey as a friend of Jin's father, Kogonada has found a new filmmaking home.|Fresh
An aching, indie cool pervades every step of the way as Kogonada obscures characters within beautifully arranged design and architecture as they ponder the mysteries of life and inspiration.|Fresh
Imperfect, but more than enough to put Kogonada on the map.|Fresh
In its precision - the framing of each shot is as eloquent as the dialogue - and measured pacing, Columbus is a balm, a deep tissue massage for the soul.|Fresh
From all the formal elegance there emerges something subtly but profoundly affecting about family and friendship.|Fresh
This is a challengingly intelligent film, and Richardson is just superb.|Fresh
The synergy between the two leads, who spend the bulk of the film merely conversing about the things they see (and how their feelings coincide), is what gives Columbus its heart.|Fresh
Brainy and sensual, cool and emotional, this wildly impressive feature debut is a coming-of-age drama that consistently defies expectation.|Fresh
This is a quiet but tremendously accomplished debut that owes a lot to the magisterial subtlety of Japanese director Yasujir√¥ Ozu.|Fresh
Columbus is in sum a compelling indie slice of life that does not try to manipulate you with cellos or violins, but rather employs plenty of that valuable thing, silence|Fresh
The movie's framings are uncannily beautiful. They remind us that films, like buildings, are formed by squares and spaces that catch light and shadow. The dialogue is a wonder too.|Fresh
It's a gentle film that never quite works up a head of steam, but its ideas are moving and provocative.|Fresh
Columbus effortlessly creeps under your skin and stays there.|Fresh
Kogonada's restrained debut asks us to find beauty and warmth in places where we may not want to look: in modern architecture, and in ourselves.|Fresh
"Columbus becomes a dark meditative quasi-romance, as we consider the term, ""modernism with a soul."""|Fresh
Columbus is extremely assured - beautiful, pristine work that is deliberate in its pacing, artfully and precisely framed in every moment, soulful and quietly moving without being overly sentimental.|Fresh
The depth of field in the compositions suggests the emotional reaches of these becalmed lives, but the film never imposes the pair's back and forth on your attention, instead letting it unfold with an equanimity that is tidal in its rise and fall.|Fresh
A wonderful film about the importance of architecture in a small Midwestern town even if the locals are mostly indifferent to it.|Fresh
A chance encounter brings these two lost souls together and the resulting film charts their evolving relationship with such serenity, the restorative effect they have on each other feels contagious.|Fresh
the melancholy emanating from Columbus, as mixture of loneliness, provincial boredom and intricate family ties, is more elegantly monotonous and uniform. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
... fills every frame with visually striking imagery by finding beauty in the ordinary.|Fresh
... essentially a story about friendship and the melancholy inherent in life's changes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As much as anything, the movie is about the zen-like stillness and symmetry of the mid-century architecture that serves as the film's backdrop.|Fresh
The changes of generational sensibility govern this story of characters with family conflict... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A wonderful film that takes the time to notice the world -- how strangers can connect with each other, how architecture can define a community, how complicated the relationships between parents and their adult children can get.|Fresh
Kogonada makes a striking debut with Columbus, a movie about architecture nerds that is itself composed like great architecture.|Fresh
Columbus doles out information in a restrained manner, building rich characters without falling back on exposition, leaving spaces for viewers to fill with their own thoughts.|Fresh
An impressive and sometimes mesmerizing directorial debut.|Fresh
Allow writer and director Kogonada to take you on a bizarrely fascinating, visually stunning, and subtly sensual tour of Columbus, Indiana's modernist architecture.|Fresh
Columbus may have been Kogonada's first directorial feature film but it shows so much promise in what the director will be offering us during the years to come.|Fresh
If writing about music is like dancing to architecture, then writing about Kogonada's movie Columbus is like waltzing to light.|Fresh
Kogonada's cleverly integrated use of the architecture, beautifully framed from visual and narrative standpoints, lends his freshman feature a sense of modernist mastery...|Fresh
"Director Kogonada, in his impressive debut, conveys emotion through site and sound. He turns out to be a master of not just visual setting, but of conversational filmmaking, and his ""Columbus"" might just be a masterpiece"|Fresh
It may take a little more effort and patience to appreciate what Columbus has to say about friendship, grief and courage, but the messages are worth that effort.|Fresh
A warm, quietly devastating drama that has plenty to offer for those open to something subtle.|Fresh
... a tender, beautiful gem that should not be overlooked.|Fresh
Columbus is a small, intimate film playing out on a big canvas, a personal drama set amongst titanic works. It's good actors doing good acting in a film shot by a master of composition.|Fresh
...crisp and subversively emotional|Fresh
Kogonada may be a skilled craftsman, but he never forgets his direction is serving the story and the characters, rather than the other way around.|Fresh
Aside from Wes Anderson movies (most notably The Grand Budapest Hotel), I'd never seen a movie that took such care in composing each and every shot...|Fresh
[The director] frames everything ... with Zen-like composition, giving Columbus a beauty that strengthens the foundation of its two transcendent lead performances.|Fresh
Columbus is the debut from Kogonda, and it marks him as a filmmaker to watch closely.|Fresh
There is not much to the story or characters of Columbus, but neither of those elements is necessarily the film's point.|Fresh
Columbus is occasionally effective in its quietness but other times it can prove to be a bit alienating.|Rotten
The filmmaking choices here exhibit a bone-deep understanding of visual storytelling that's remarkable for a first-timer.|Fresh
Kogonada in his impressive feature debut applies the principles of these architects to the compositions and structure of the film, a formal tour-de-force that eclipses its modest - though affecting and impeccably acted - narrative.|Fresh
Emotion swells, and the landscape, the frames and the utopian architecture inextricably fuse to entrancing effect... It's a dreamy all-American clash, the beautiful of form made strange placed up against the visual iconography of the placid Midwest.|Fresh
As delicately beautiful a film as you're likely to see.|Fresh
Each shot is meticulously composed without appearing mannered; the characters, often seen from a distance, make up an integral part of the landscape they occupy rather than being framed picturesquely against it.|Fresh
...fluidly incorporates architectural artistry into that of the cinema.|Fresh
Even the impressive structures throughout the city cannot disguise the fact that we've seen these characters before. They lack depth and, at times, appear as human props supporting the architecture.|Fresh
A mesmerizing film about the poetics of place and the difficult choices we must make to stay true to our passions.|Fresh
The city of Columbus, Indiana, that hotbed of modern architectural design, should be billed right up there with the film's human stars.|Fresh
Always great to look at, Columbus nonetheless can feel boring, studied and overly composed, so much so that it made me hope that Kogonada would loosen the arty cords that may be binding him and that sometimes constrict this otherwise promising work.|Fresh
Columbus is an assured first feature film by Kogonada, the single-named video essayist who makes film-analysis shorts about such auteurs as Ozu, Linklater, Tarkovsky, and Malick for the Criterion Collection and Sight & Sound magazine.|Fresh
Placing his figures in cinematographer Elisha Christian's meticulously composed frames, the filmmaker uses Eero Saarinen's modern designs as a communication bridge between two strangers, a meditation on asymmetry and balance.|Fresh
It's an impressive, calculating film about a pair of loners torn between academia and the real world.|Fresh
"The director's greatest strength lies in creating a mood. ""Columbus"" is melancholy without being morose, and talky without forced cleverness."|Fresh
In its best moments, Columbus doubles as a reminder that films speak in a language all their own, and that language often cuts deeper than words.|Fresh
A tale of seeming opposites with surprising, deeply meaningful tangents, COLUMBUS considers communication that has little to do with spoken words, and characters that need the perspective of an outsider in order to see their own lives clearly.|Fresh
What's remarkable about this wondrously assured debut is that technique never overwhelms feeling, in part because Kogonada makes the two seem inextricably, harmoniously linked.|Fresh
Kogonada shoots it all lovingly, mostly in locked-down medium and wide two-shots; the camera seldom moves, closeups are used sparingly but effectively, and it's all set to a shimmery, ambient score.|Fresh
Through the figurative lens of Richardson's performance and the literal lens of Kogonada's camera, we see Columbus for what it is: A moral lesson about keeping ourselves in neutral.|Fresh
Almost startling in how assured it is, synthesizing beautiful, controlled images with story and character.|Fresh
Kogonada put his deep film knowledge to good use in this stunning debut, delivering a movie with a perspective and message that stands out from the crowd.|Fresh
But instead of a guided architectural tour with a quirky girl-meets-boy story pasted on, Columbus lets the sheer physicality of the architecture free its characters' feelings. Aesthetes and incurable romantics may actually find it inspirational.|Fresh
Quietly moving, provocative, and refreshingly understated. It's the most wise and visually striking film since La Sapienza.|Fresh
Quiet, talky character drama has exceptional performances.|Fresh
Columbus is a charming and beautiful indie debut.|Fresh
Cho, who's been a quiet, authentic and always appealing asset of American cinema for two decades now, [gives] a beautifully understated performance.|Fresh
The depth of emotion the film stirred up surprised me. I got so involved in these two people's lives. I cared about them. I liked eavesdropping on their conversations.|Fresh
A minimalist film like Columbus depends almost entirely on the shading of the characters and the depths of the performances. By that metric, it's a too-delicate creature, tickling and piquing instead of fully thrusting us into the realm of feelings.|Fresh
As much as it is about architecture, the film is also a love letter to movies themselves: the sense of majesty they can capture and the strange little worlds they allow us to discover.|Fresh
The feature directing debut of Kogonada, the South Korean video essayist and critic, is a poetic spellbinder about two strangers bonding over modern architecture.|Fresh
Despite Richardson and Cho's assured performances, their characters, dialogue, and relationship are never fully believable.|Rotten
"""Columbus"" is a feast for the eyes, but its more lasting impression is on the heart."|Fresh
It is a film heavily concerned with the human aspects of artistry, and how even a well-built bank can touch and enrich an inquisitive eye and mind.|Fresh
The movie leaves quite a bit to the eye of the beholder, but it's always worth looking at.|Fresh
As a movie about intimacy Columbus is a masterpiece.|Fresh
...it's also gorgeous and pure, reflected not only in the otherworldly architecture of the titular Indiana town, but in the performances.|Fresh
An outwardly chilly, resolutely static film that nevertheless finds poignancy in the most surprising places, Kogonada's directorial debut does a couple of important things so well that I can't help but forgive the things it doesn't.|Fresh
The seeming miracle of Columbus is its mixture of formal precision with a philosophical grasp of human mystery.|Fresh
Small talk is happily abandoned as two people--a mature Korean-American man a 20-year-old woman--discuss the meaning of life, each offering advice to the other.|Fresh
Even so, Columbus is intensely moving-only you have to be prepared to slip between the lines of its perfectly formed geometry to find the sources of its emotion.|Fresh
Haley Lu Richardson puts the story on her shoulders and elevates the film into a beguiling, thin air. She lends the beautiful but empty buildings a beating heart.|Fresh
Something not merely impressive, but in every respect a surprise.|Fresh
Columbus crept up on me so gradually and quietly that I don't even know when I started to love it. When it was over, though, I was left with a sweet aftertaste that stayed with me for hours.|Fresh
Cho is something of a revelation here. He's long deserved bigger, better roles, but this is something else entirely.|Fresh
One of the most artful, sensitive and intellectual grief movies I've ever seen.|Fresh
The first feature film from Korean-American video essay pioneer Kogonada, chimes like a bell: simple, sustained and thrillingly pure.|Fresh
"""Columbus"" is one of the rare films in which nerdy intelligence-knowledge without experience-comes off without neurosis, comedic awkwardness, or vengeance."|Fresh
kogonada ... brings a deeply idiosyncratic stylistic and dramatic sensibility to a story that's not just a character piece, but also a finely nuanced study of people, space and consciousness.|Fresh
Lovely and tender, marking Kogonada as an auteur to watch.|Fresh
The impressive range and carefully planned progression of Kogonada's formal ideas would be quite useless if they weren't in function of a story worth telling.|Fresh
An impeccably composed drama of quiet humanity and curiosity.|Fresh
A film with precise lines that captures very imprecise human emotions.|Fresh
A clever and compelling exploration into how physical structures can come to represent emotional landmarks in our personal lives.|Fresh
The compassion with which Columbus films its building-laden titular town is nothing short of invigorating.|Fresh
Come for the breathtaking architectural scenery, stay for the likable pair staring up at it.|Fresh
