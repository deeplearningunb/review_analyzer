A winning and utterly entertaining look at the joys of education and the sheer importance science plays in our everyday lives.|Fresh
The drama, exhilaration, defeat, wins and spectrum of emotion is real. The outcome matters as these teenagers will certainly help shape our futures.|Fresh
The film is fascinating, and delivers a welcome pro-science message from a country that sometimes seems to be sliding toward a new Dark Age. But there's a distinct lack of tension in the competition.|Fresh

Even if the future seems bleak at times, the emerging generation is full of hope and wonder, curiosity and verve.|Fresh
an engaging, entertaining, and enormously insightful documentary|Fresh

This is a movie that will give you hope for the future in some cases, and utter despair in others. It is about some of the smartest, most dedicated students and teachers in the world competing in an international science and math competition.|Fresh
It's refreshing to see a documentary which offers hope through the minds of the next generation.|Fresh
A crowd-pleasing, if slightly formulaic, documentary...|Fresh
Our heroes develop complex science projects. They cruise to the finals. Excellence is celebrated. Yet the film, though perfectly competent, never quite matches the sheer inventiveness of its young Einsteins.|Fresh
Engaging but somewhat slight doc on the world's biggest youth science contest.|Fresh
Science Fair falls somewhere between an episode of Big Bang Theory and Mad Hot Ballroom - entertaining, often funny, sometimes awkward, and always educational.|Fresh
I loved it.|Fresh
Unabashedly celebrates intelligence and even leaves you with hope for the future, a quality that's been in short supply of late.|Fresh
The discreet charm of the nerdoisie.|Fresh

The film's beautiful, beating heart is these kids.|Fresh
If you affectionately recall Jeffrey Blitz's 2002 National Spelling Bee documentary 'Spellbound,' you will probably have a good time at the equally engrossing 'Science Fair.'|Fresh
This fascinating, inspiring documentary about brilliant teens competing in the Olympics of science fairs should be mandatory viewing for all young students.|Fresh
It fills you with optimism. But even more, it causes you to rethink how these dedicated kids live and work in amenity - not by choice, but by society's misplaced values on what constitutes a high school hero.|Fresh
When so much of our mental energy is spent in politics, it is refreshing to see a (largely) apolitical film celebrate humanity at its finest.|Fresh
Their agonies and ecstasies are equally fascinating...|Fresh
Even if you never competed in a science fair, you can understand and appreciate the creativity and hard work that went in to all the projects presented...|Fresh

I'd be surprised if Science Fair didn't show up on this year's Oscar's documentary shortlist.|Fresh
