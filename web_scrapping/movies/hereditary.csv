Be warned, this slow-burn film is seriously spooky. But expect prickling terror rather than jump-out-of-the-seat scares, although there is one sudden shock to make you gulp.|Fresh
Toni Collette delivers a soul-shattering performance in Hereditary that reminds us how much sacrifice parenthood is and how deeply parents can scar their children, utterly beyond repair.|Fresh
As a portrait of a family split by tragedy, it's a masterpiece of almost unbearable tension. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Besides references to ritualistic patterns and symbols, there are scary, furtive appearances and characters airing guilt and resentment in an oppressive environment.|Fresh
Hereditary literally demonizes a transgender spirit.|Rotten
Hereditary, while struggling a bit at the end, offers a wholly original horror tale from newcomer Ari Aster.|Fresh
This is the rare horror movie with an earned shock so unexpected and horrific that it left this veteran fan -- whose eyeballs have ingested literally thousands of screen dismemberments, decapitations and mutilations -- aghast.|Fresh
Hereditary combines domestic drama and occult horror for a one-two punch that still has me knocked to the ground.|Fresh
It's pure aesthetic the whole way through, and, certainly, for the first 30-40 minutes the genuinely unsettling atmosphere is brilliantly sustained.|Fresh
El legado del diablo merece ser reconocida como una de las propuestas de horror m√°s crudas y efectivas que se han visto en este siglo.|Fresh

There are images in HEREDITARY that cannot go unseen, but humanity is discovered in the awful truths that unravel.|Fresh
"Hereditary arrives like a white-hot dagger driven directly into the base of the viewer's skull. It's not merely ""good""; it's downright traumatic."|Fresh
Hereditary is a kitchen-sink drama disguised as a horror film, employing the intensity of both genres to full effect.|Fresh
You really think Hereditary's bounty of symbolism will amount to something profound, until the third act when you realize it's abandoned all of its commentary for typical horror fare.|Rotten
Hereditary can be difficult to watch, but for those who are willing and able to take this ride, it is likely to offer hours of discussion among friends and maybe even a few nightmares of your own.|Fresh
Hereditary is a disturbing descent into madness that highlights all the best parts of the horror genre.|Fresh
This is a film that pivots from quiet grief to sickening, nightmare-fuel imagery without ever losing an inch of ground-building tension.|Fresh
An outstandingly horrifying achievement from a debut filmmaker, Hereditary is a classic in the making, built on rock-solid, terrifying, atmospheric terror.|Fresh

Hereditary isn't the next Exorcist, but it's not a bad start. Maybe the next generation will be a little better.|Fresh
From its opening frames, Hereditary digs its claws into you and doesn't let go.|Fresh
Ari Aster has crafted a ghost story that brings hair on the back of your neck standing up-type chills. It's an engaging tale of the supernatural anchored by a show-stopping performance from Toni Collette.|Fresh
Hereditary is a numbing experience. It attempts to unsettle, shock and terrify - and it does so mildly well. And yet that seems like the only goal.|Rotten
Mental illness rubs up against the occult in Aster's malevolent movie Hereditary, about a mother forced to face her familial fears when her own tyrannical mother passes away.|Fresh
A deeply unsettling and horrifically disturbing film which will haunt you for a lifetime.|Fresh
Its sheer hopelessness and tragic consequences are a haunting counterpoint to more traditional horror fare, where Final Girls escape and monsters are unable to win the day.|Fresh
You can believe the hype, Hereditary is absolutely nuts|Fresh
An instant horror classic joining the ranks of Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist.|Fresh
It wasn't just pure gore, it actually messed you up a bit. It made sure you didn't sleep at night.|Fresh
There's nothing about this movie that I enjoyed, for two hours and seven minutes...this just isn't my cup of tea...|Rotten
An absolute masterpiece in horror cinema|Fresh
Aster, in his debut, invites you to imagine the unimaginable in a series of utterly devastating sequences that come to grips with one horrific loss after another.|Fresh
... an assured debut that folds in Shirley Jackson, Rosemary Woodhouse and, for its immersive creepiness, 'Seance on a Wet Afternoon' ... Collette fearlessly explores Annie's primal fears, at times contorting her face into hideous mask|Fresh
Hereditary terrifies from its first unnerving moments to its bombastic, nerve-shredding finale. This is by far the most affecting and effective horror film of the year.|Fresh
Its trippy turn at first feels refreshing, then goofy: the fatalism and sense of doom underpinning the film are very hard to take as seriously.|Rotten
It touches on annihilating despair, and asks its cast to lower themselves into an emotional meat grinder in a way that the film, I say, does not earn.|Rotten
But it's also genuinely horrific in a way that so many supposed horror films are not.|Fresh
A genuinely scary movie, delectably unsettling.|Fresh
Hereditary ramps up the horror and anguish to points which at times feel almost unbearable.|Fresh
I loved that this movie scared me without resorting to [jump scares].|Fresh
It builds the elements really beautifully, it orchestrally builds. You're really watching a family drama also with horror elements, then they really elevate.|Fresh
There's so much happening that it's difficult to talk too much without full-on spoilers. Just know that the two-hour-plus runtime is airtight.|Fresh
Aster takes advantage of a remarkably committed cast to explore family dysfunction of the most insidious type.|Fresh
Hereditary [is] one of the rare enigmatic experiences you'd rather not entirely understand. And I'll be damned if I have to re-watch it to truly get it.|Fresh
Toni Collette spectacularly dominates the film in a pumped-up, emotionally overwrought, deranged performance.|Fresh
It's an uneasy and visually well-crafted horror exploring our parental fears. It's also a film that, surprise, surprise, has split opinions among audiences and critics.|Fresh
[Hereditary] is a tense picture, but one I found ultimately unfulfilling.|Rotten
Hereditary is terror at its most vile, a film that will unexpectedly creep up on you and haunt you for days.|Fresh
Be warned, this is indeed a scary movie. Like the recent and much louder A Quiet Place, this is cinema designed to slowly assault your senses and make you look over your shoulder on your way home.|Fresh
Collette shines brightest... It's the type of rare performance which elevates and transcends the narrative beyond any of its familiarities or limitations - and its exactly what makes Hereditary and all its disturbing intentions so powerful.|Fresh
This may be a psychological thriller, but Hereditary features some of the most unsettling imagery of the year that triggers stuff of nightmares.|Fresh
It would be a far cry to claim that Hereditary is perfect,... but as far as debut features go, it is damningly smart and expects more of its audience than is necessary in a market swarmed with uninspired franchise films.|Fresh
Hereditary draws on the tropes of many different horror genres, which the fully engaged cast manage to help pull off without it all becoming too confusing.|Fresh
Has moments to wobble the collys, and makes sharp points about motherhood and duty, but as the hysteria mounts the credibility fades.|Fresh
'Hereditary' is unsettling, terrifying, and brutal.|Fresh
How do you know when a film doesn't deliver in a particular genre? The audience starts to laugh at scenes that are supposed to be genuinely terrifying.|Rotten
The film lives up to this reputation. Yet those calling it the second coming of horror seem to be all too forgiving of the blatant narrative telegraphing and simplistic characterizations of those living outside the nightmare.|Fresh
"The new horror film ""Hereditary"" is being hyped not only as the scariest movie in years, but as one of the best films of the year. No arguments here."|Fresh
All things considered, Hereditary is the movie to see if you want to feel uneasy, upset, and most of all suspicious of seemingly nice old ladies.|Fresh
Writer/director Ari Aster has clearly studied the greats.|Fresh
Aster brings together plenty of brilliant pieces. The harrowed cast does a great job at showing a family breaking down under the pressure of its guilt and grief.|Fresh
'Hereditary' breaks tradition.|Fresh
"[Director Ari] Aster's ability to ""coax"" us into this fantasy is surprising: like Annie with her miniatures and reproduction of reality, the director is meticulous and precise in handling audio, time, atmosphere and performances. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
There is no visual creativity and the ending is more of a joke: the film bites its own tail. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
This movie was created not only to entertain us but forces us to look at ourselves in relation to how we take grief. What makes this movie different from others is that it never relies on jump scares to provoke a reaction.|Fresh
The horrors are that much more horrible because they emerge from and intensify a chamber drama of family conflict that would be gripping in and of itself. The horror, in other words, has real meaning.|Fresh
Toni Collette does some extraordinary work, acting through a series of contorted faces, guttural howls, and despondent line deliveries.|Fresh
Hereditary has top notch acting, a gorgeous look, and some genuinely terrifying moments that linger.|Fresh
As Annie, Toni Collette gives a ferocious performance, one that bounces from defensive to vulnerable, from furious to terrified, in an instant but is never histrionic or cloying.|Fresh
The final act is a master class in swiftly mounting dread, and the climax is both terrifying and deeply unsettling.|Fresh
The movie throbs with a relentless underlying terror that is frequently mystifying, sometimes aggravating, and almost always poised to keep the mind engaged in disquieting wonder.|Fresh
Hereditary seeks to confound by swinging between moments of controlled Kubrick-ian terror and unhinged emotional hysteria.|Fresh
As it builds to a climax, the film takes a wild turn into hell with a bombast that seems unnecessary and undermining. Some viewers may be juiced by something this over-the-top, but I prefer the darker subtlety of a more quiet place.|Rotten
Unfortunately, the weaknesses in its script make Hereditary far from being at the level of the classics and leave it closer to effective, but disposable films like Insidious or The Amityville Horror. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
A new contemporary horror classic. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
My disappointment would be less bitter if the first half weren't so strong, and I commend Aster for the effort, especially his direction of actors, all of whom shine.|Rotten
Like poetry itself. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hereditary is, despite the influences of classic films that can be detected during its viewing, a work with its own voice, which reinvents the foundations of the genre to deliver something different and absolutely brilliant. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Put quite bluntly: Hereditary is a fiasco. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Hereditary adds itself to a small, but juicy list of films who carefully and patiently create terror for audiences. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hereditary doesn't let the audience off easily. It's a film designed to have maximum impact.|Fresh
Manipulatively subtle, it's scary stuff, particularly the gory, grisly, over-the-top finale.|Fresh
Aster never relies on jump scares to provoke a reaction... The supernatural is treated calmly, and it is the normal in fact, that is out of the ordinary.|Fresh
As the story progresses, there is a perfect overture and poetic synthesis for a story about a family that lives trapped in something that surpasses it... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
There is no scenario that ends with you having a pleasant experience watching this film. There is a malevolence about it, an unshakable evilness that penetrates your psyche drop by painful drop.|Fresh
Despite the Academy's disdain for horror, Collette could win an Oscar for this incendiary performance.|Fresh
One of those films that I didn't love, but nevertheless admired the gumption that led to something so completely bonkers to actually reach the screen.|Fresh
Ari Aster's directorial debut 'Hereditary' is truly an original that moves slowly yet completely and totally terrifies you when you least expect it to.|Fresh
If you are looking to truly and completely get scared, 'Hereditary' will ensure that happens in the best and most unexpected way possible.|Fresh
The lasting nightmarish effect that [Hereditary] is due to it's strong cinematic elements. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Director Ari Aster] wisely avoids resorting to cheap scares and incorporates the right amount of exposition without preying upon it and frightening the public just for pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ride of pure terror? I've had more terrifying rides on the teacups at the fair.|Rotten
Collette's performance is hairraisingly good.|Fresh
In a genre so driven by convention it's great to see another horror movie so soon after A Quiet Place take a few left turns and deliver the scares we expect by means that we don't...A very effective, cliche-averse chiller.|Fresh
Hereditary speaks with the language of lowbrow horror when it's been setting itself up as something a little classier and a lot more original.|Rotten
Hereditary rises above the genre formula with its coolly composed formalism, its deliberate pacing, and its sly psychological manipulation that almost convinces us at certain points that this is more of a domestic drama than a horror movie.|Fresh
An astonishing performance by Collette as the unhinged parent elevates the scarily nuanced narrative into a league of its own. Hereditary is an emotionally wrenching viewing experience.|Fresh
When it's bad, Hereditary feels like the wrong kind of exploitation flick, one that doesn't inhabit its traumas deeply and so believes a character as beautifully performed as Annie's deserves to be the butt of a cosmic joke.|Rotten
Destined to be a classic...|Fresh
It rambles on for more than two hours, thumbing through genre touchstones like a drunk in a video store, serving up the occasional visual that sticks.|Rotten
Hereditary is a horror film that not only transmits fear - which does provoke it, especially in its last minutes, frankly delirious - but, also, a growing sense of discomfort.|Fresh
You've heard it a million times: how horror movies are clich√©. This movie is not clich√©.... This movie does not rely on jump scares, nor is it predictable.|Fresh
It's a skin-prickling slow-boiler that builds like a storm.|Fresh
Probably Toni Collette's best role to date... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Toni] Collette is a true force of nature... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A work that deserves attention and needs to be seen more than once. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Could it do for the genre, as some have claimed, what the likes of The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity once did? Short answer - no.|Rotten
The films strong suits successfully envelop us to witness some of the darkest and most unsettling stories in cinematic history. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Ari Aster] is too clever for his own good, and late on discards his duty to his story and characters in favour of shocks and effects that feel both familiar and contrived...A film that was brooding and fascinating becomes silly, even risible.|Rotten
An indelible classic.|Fresh
Gradually downshifts into generic cliche, abandoning well-mapped psychogeography for psychokinetic silliness and superfluous plot exposition.|Rotten
"Watching this movie, I was all like ""Nope...no...you aren't going to do that. Not allowed...No! Stop that! You stop that!!!"" I was scared."|Fresh
Blumhouse with brains.|Fresh
I was so scared, I was walking down the sidewalk seeing things. So many images in my mind because of this movie...it horrified me, which is what it's supposed to do.|Fresh
But the neatest trick that Hereditary manages is the feeling, especially in that beginning and with its ending, that there's some strange force beyond us, perhaps even beyond this film, just waiting and beholding us...|Fresh
Ari Aster immediately proves himself a deft hand at disorientating his audience, conjuring a quite remarkable piece of unsettling, genuinely nightmarish cinema.|Fresh
Hereditary might be regarded as a psychological or supernatural thriller, an insidious ghost story, a literal cult movie, or Rosemary's Baby (1968) after the infant has come of age. On any view, it is a diabolically assured debut.|Fresh
This is the worst best time you'll have at the cinema this year.|Fresh
The results are horrific, emotionally and aesthetically, and launch a corkscrew spin towards hell.|Fresh
Hereditary is a beautifully shot, brilliantly acted and smartly written supernatural chiller which suggests we are entering a new golden age of the scary movie.|Fresh
The best American horror film since The Sixth Sense.|Fresh
It's an astonishing performance from Collette, a disorientating cocktail of humane, hurtful and hysterical.|Fresh
It sidesteps easy interpretation so stylishly that even when it's dangling obvious horror movie tropes in front of us, there's no danger of it being mistaken for a conventional genre exercise.|Fresh
Aster, who somewhat alarmingly is said to have been inspired by his own family experiences to make this film, announces himself as a serious talent.|Fresh
If you let this movie in, you may not be able to get it out.|Fresh
Being blindsided by fright might be fun in the moment, but it's the scares you can see coming that last.|Fresh
I've rarely left a cinema feeling so disappointed.|Rotten
An instant horror classic - and quite possibly the scariest film of the decade.|Fresh
Hereditary is a hallmark in cinematic filmmaking, and still worth a watch, but the narrative prevents it from living up to its full potential.|Fresh
Aster is clearly a talent to keep an eye on, while Collette deserves some form of awards recognition. Family drama has rarely been so nightmarish.|Fresh
As a horror film, Hereditary delivers the goods, with crack pacing and a third act of sheer gothic madness.|Fresh
Hereditary may not be as terrifying as the advance hype has suggested but it's a provocative and subtle horror film with layers you don't find in more conventional haunted house tales.|Fresh
It's poorly paced, with a making-it-up-as-we-go feel; there's a difference between slow-burn and merely slow, and [director Ari] Aster hasn't grasped it yet.|Rotten
What I watched was a pushy, empurpled, same-with-a-twist screamer from the school of Rosemary's Baby.|Rotten
It's utterly terrifying - but in a way you can't quite put your finger on. Which means you will never, ever shake it off.|Fresh
This is serious, glorious, edge-of-your-seat horror.|Fresh
The young American writer-director has made a film that goes to a few places that no horror has previously ventured. And he does so elegantly.|Fresh
It's the picture's unrelenting mood of apprehension and anxiety that marks Ari Aster's debut feature as a disturbing, discomforting masterpiece.|Fresh
Will unhinge you on a primal level starting with the hypocrisy of obituaries and the creepiness of dollhouses, and ending with the stresses of modern family life as reality and madness become interchangeable.|Fresh
A raw horror masterpiece from a first-time director that deserves to be mentioned in the same frantic breath as the genre's greats.|Fresh
"If there is such a thing as an ""art house horror,"" Hereditary should stand as one of the best examples... [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
What makes it a unique and sublime work are its images, terrifying not because they are macabre of fortuitous, but because they seem to connect with something deep and dark that escapes us completely. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a well-crafted and well-acted classic creepy psychological horror film.|Fresh
It's definitely going to stick with you for a while.|Fresh
To get to the end result of Aster's narrative is to go through an intense storm of chaos all meticulously adjusted to freeze you to the horrors of this family's truth. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hereditary commands you to lean in, watch closely, don't forget the corners and the background, even though you know the monsters are there.|Fresh
Grief has a demonic presence in Hereditary...|Fresh
When our own mental sanity starts failing us...it's really, really cool.|Fresh
One of the best horror films I've seen in a very long time.|Fresh
Plot holes abound.|Rotten
Anyone who tells you that Hereditary will leave you with nightmares presumes that you'll actually be able to sleep again - it kept me awake long after I saw it.|Fresh
A rich, original horror story and astounding performances result in two hours of edge-of-your-seat terror, but the final moments leave the film just short of modern masterpiece territory.|Fresh
Unnerving film. Paranormal done unlike the usual paranormal film. It's as much about the implosion of a family as it is about the horror that causes the implosion.|Fresh
I give much due to Aster for his remarkable ability to create atmospherics, establishing a mood of uneasiness and continuing to up the ante.|Fresh
By the time the film gets into the home stretch it goes totally off the rails...|Rotten
With supernatural elements failing to pay off as window-dressing for a potentially serious broken-family drama, an audience giggling throughout the film's ending is the least of Hereditary's problems.|Rotten
An impressive calling card that writer-director Ari Aster can whip out at future studio pitches.|Fresh
Truthfully, bits of story may have been borrowed from (horror) classics, but that doesn't mean first-time writer/director Ari Aster doesn't have a parcel of creepy-crawly tricks of his own to display.|Fresh
...the film examines how grief clouds judgment and renders us susceptible to manipulation by those who would abuse it for material gain.|Fresh
Hereditary is a movie to be watched from between your fingers, and to be carried home as a feeling of unease under your skin.|Fresh
[N]erve-shredding perfection, exactly the kind of experience that leaves the viewer screaming for mercy, but ignores those cries in favor of twisting the blade.|Fresh
Hereditary is one of the most @#$%ed-up horror movies I've ever seen. No higher praise can be paid.|Fresh
A go-for-broke stunner overflowing in a myriad of petrifying mysteries many will be attempting to decipher for a number of years to come.|Fresh
Where it does succeed, though, is in its depiction of a family in crisis...|Fresh
I will talk about movies having a sense of dread, this is the all-time grand champion of that.|Fresh
Hereditary runs 127 minutes -- some of the best recent horrors tend to clock in at between 90 and 100 -- but there isn't an ounce of fat in the story.|Fresh
It's 2:38am and I'm convinced there's someone, or some-thing, in the attic. I have Ari Aster's first feature film Hereditary to thank for the past four nights of anxiety-induced sleeplessness.|Fresh
Hereditary has the trappings of an arthouse horror movie, but a punk rock soul.|Fresh
Aster captures it all with a heart-wrenching sense of everyday horror.|Fresh
Here is a film that evokes the ugliest and darkest corners of our most fundamental selves, viewing our genetic identity as a maximum-security prison of sorts.|Fresh
The film's subtle shocks and realistic drama combine to create a dreamlike atmosphere, drenched in psychological horror, which builds and builds to a climax that you won't forget anytime soon...|Fresh
Hereditary is a horror movie that definitely recognizes the potential horrors of family life, and is at its best when it focuses on that.|Rotten
Hereditary is a sometimes exceedingly uncomfortable horror-drama with stars unfamiliar within the genre, a doomy sense of mostly-sustained menace and a series of twists and turns that make it damn hard to talk about.|Fresh
Yes, there's a certain familiarity to its general horror notes -- but only until those daring, shattering moments in which Hereditary erupts insanely and reveals itself as a thing all its own.|Fresh
Fans of this genre will find a lot to be creeped out by in this gory spook fest. My mom, however, would not approve.|Fresh
Here's a haunted-houses movie for the ages.|Fresh
Hereditary makes blood run cold with moments of pure terror... [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
With nary a jump scare in sight, Aster has created a moody piece with a delicate but devastating sense of dread.|Fresh
The visually hyper-articulate Ari Aster understands one important thing that any director working in the horror/thriller mode should: that the half-seen is more terrible than the big reveal.|Fresh
Hereditary is devastating in its delivery and offers a bloodcurdling look into a hellish, supernatural narrative. Just be ready to live with it for a while.|Fresh
Hereditary has more spooky ideas than it knows what to do with, but enough of what it throws at the wall sticks to make for one twisted horror movie.|Fresh
Having announced itself, it works as a bravura technical exercise in the slow reveal. Cameras are forever following terrified gazes to the source of the terror, and revelation builds on revelation until an awful culmination begins to seem inevitable.|Fresh
This clammy, creeping horror movie is deeply rooted in classics from the 1960s, '70s, and beyond, but it also builds on them; it's deliberate and severe, and it's not afraid to cross a line or two.|Fresh
It is indeed an intense film, more creepy than scary, and just may make your skin crawl.|Fresh
An absolutely astonishing debut...|Fresh
Collette effortlessly captures Annie's real fears and anxieties. She looks as if she hasn't slept in months and that protecting her family from harm is getting increasingly futile.|Fresh
Hereditary is a good horror film with inclinations to be truly great.|Fresh
A decently constructed, slow-burn horror drama that takes advantage of a familiar setting, a terrific performance from Collette, and some genuinely spooky and creepy moments. (Full Content Review - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
No shot seems wasted, the editing is a sturdy and linear rebuke to the quick-cut madness that's infected so many recent genre films, and the sound and set design are meticulous and spare.|Fresh
We're invited to contemplate the torments of mental instability and the awful intimacies of family life, as well as whatever malignant forces may lurk behind the veil of everyday existence.|Fresh
Collette's performance should, and will, continue to push that conversation forward as she contends for -- and possibly receives -- Oscar glory by scaring the daylights out of unsuspecting audiences.|Fresh
[A] terrifying thriller that pins you to the back of your chair and leaves you paralyzed in fear.|Fresh
Forget the 'scarier than The Exorcist' line (whatever that means) that Hereditary has been tagged with - this is a movie that lives up to the hype on its own terms.|Fresh
The film is so restrained you may wonder whether it's a horror movie at all, and not a kitchen-table drama about an imploding family.|Fresh
Toni Collette's work as a mother who's jolted between grief, anxiety and rage...is one for the ages, belonging in the same breath as Linda Blair in The Exorcist and Sissy Spacek in Carrie.|Fresh
Watching Hereditary inspires the kind of fear that makes you irrationally check for phantom hands under your seat that might reach out and grab you.|Fresh
Hereditary takes itself too seriously, it's too long, too predictable and frequently frustrating.|Rotten
Aster's genius here is in the way he welds old-fashioned spook-show juju to disturbingly realistic domestic turmoil.|Fresh
[W]riter/director Ari Aster, making his feature debut, takes us through a chilling exploration of mourning and madness.|Fresh
Hereditary is undeniably scary and unusually well-crafted, but eventually less than the sum of its parts.|Rotten
It's a family drama tinged with an ominous climate, built by disturbing details that lead in crescendo. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The paradox of Hereditary is that a film seemingly cut off from everyday experience nonetheless pushes buttons very close to home.|Fresh
Hereditary's carefully controlled release of essential intel bleeds its way into your consciousness and steadily sets about leaving a bruise there.|Fresh
The indelibly unwholesome Hereditary does earn its comparison to [Rosemary's Baby], which tells you a lot about how accomplished it is.|Fresh
One of the most emotionally harrowing horror movies in years.|Fresh
Aster's direction is sure-handed. This story steers into unexpected territory with confidence, and whether or not you like where it goes, you can rarely say it played it safe.|Fresh
A devastating portrait of an American family in sudden, inexplicable decline.|Fresh
Hereditary reaps a cheap sort of reward. It's good, but really only just good enough.|Fresh
From scene to scene it's quite compelling, and Collette is brilliant as a brittle artist with obvious control issues.|Fresh
The rare horror film that wears its influences on its sleeve but is nevertheless original enough to keep even genre buffs guessing (not to mention fearing).|Fresh
Collette deserves best actress consideration for playing another mother trapped in another inexplicable, spine-tingling situation.|Fresh
"""Hereditary"" is staged, photographed and acted so brilliantly, and brings up issues of motherhood, resentment and creativity with such subtlety, that it's tempting to overlook its alternately astonishing and laughable excesses."|Fresh
Aster has crafted a story with one foot in the world of the tense kitchen-sink drama and the other in something far more supernatural.|Fresh
Unsettling in its arid, controlled creepiness, but largely distinguished by Toni Collette's intricately layered lead performance, a portrayal of a woman whose love for her family spirals into mad decay.|Fresh
Hereditary is wicked existential horror.|Fresh
Aster just might be... a major new talent. With this film, at least, he's so good it's scary.|Fresh
Poorly constructed endings can leave an unpleasant aftertaste even for movies that are otherwise mostly solid. That's the case here.|Rotten
An old-fashioned, effectively atmospheric chiller about a woman falling apart after the death of her mother.|Fresh
A visceral experience so deeply unsettling that you don't feel right afterward. Dirty, even. So unclean that a church visit wouldn't be out of the question.|Fresh
Mr. Aster writes an impressive-looking check and succeeds in cashing it, but on close examination the payout turns out to be skimpier than anticipated, and drawn mostly on someone else's account.|Fresh
It's brilliant, challenging, deliberate, scary as all get out.|Fresh
This is a horror film for the ages, a slowly unraveling puzzle of psychological torment that promises an amazing career from freshman feature writer-director Ari Aster.|Fresh
Hereditary is a great horror movie.|Fresh
a masterpiece of freaky filmmaking, unsettling from its very first image through its hellish denouement.|Fresh
Hereditary turns up the heat incrementally, but even when the frames erupt in flames, the hellfire cools as if waiting for an additional opportunity to scorch yet another layer of flesh.|Fresh

This one's genuinely gut-wrenching - pack some diapers.|Fresh
"""Hereditary"" is closer in tone to the likes of ""The Babadook,"" ""It Follows,"" ""A Quiet Place"" and ""It Comes at Night,"" where the dread and fear come not from what you see but what you think you might see."|Fresh
Where other actresses would play a single note, Collette plays a symphony of emotions. She will nearly bring you to tears and then make you laugh before you know it. Academy Awards don't even feel like enough of a plaudit for this kind of performance.|Fresh
"""Hereditary"" is that rare thing - a smart horror movie that doesn't outsmart itself by refusing to deliver. Its mood is dark and forbidding and just keeps building. Its scares are genuinely shocking. And the ending..."|Fresh
"Aster has spent a lot of time studying ""The Shining,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" It's nice to have a classicist back in town."|Fresh

Hereditary is so refreshing in part because it invents its own scare vocabulary.|Fresh
In its sense of poisoned family bloodlines, of the everyday invaded by unspeakable evil, of bonechilling terror you won't be able to shake, Hereditary is a new horror landmark. Toni Collette should have Oscar calling.|Fresh
Working with a superb cast, a crafty, teasing musical score by Colin Stetson and a steady accumulation of wracked nerves, gathered image by carefully planned image, this movie promises a paradoxically bright future for its director.|Fresh
A masterclass in writing, direction and acting.|Fresh

When you pare away its demonic accoutrements, you're left with the most intractably nightmarish arena of all: hearth and home.|Fresh
The sinister ambiance has a terrible grace, but its raw and honest portrait of grief and guilt is ultimately diminished by the supernatural horror that is also at play.|Rotten
If you're looking for something that operates on a deeper psychological level while still searing into your brain some of the most disturbing visuals projected on screen, then strap in for quite an experience.|Fresh
[A] style-over-substance Rosemary's Baby/Wicker Man riff riddled with tension-diluting inconsistencies and hamstrung by a holier-than-thou approach to horror tropes.|Rotten
Hereditary's tonal inconsistency and lack of thematic depth stops it from ever being scary - but that isn't to say it doesn't impress.|Fresh
...an easy film to recommend to adventurous genre lovers.|Fresh
