Catherine Frot's performance as the titular title character is notable and layered, and the film provides a wonderful supporting cast.|Fresh
What keeps this together is the glowing, sensitive performance from Catherine Frot (The Page Turner), who plays the deluded singer with an earnest grace.|Fresh
Catherine Frot is heartbreakingly wonderful as Marguerite Dumont, whose love of opera is passionate and sincere and yet whose talent for it is close to zero.|Fresh
Marguerite offers pathos bathed in luxury and delusion with a hint of compassion.|Fresh
[Catherine Frot's] so charismatic-and so brimming with commendable, borderline pathological self-regard-that this imaginary person made me want to retract every real, deservedly bad review I've ever written.|Fresh
An elegant film that always maintains the pathetic case of Margarita's vocation in the thin line that separates the corrosive mood of tenderness as a strong feeling. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Because of Mpunga and Frot, Marguerite is a pleasant and emotive experience.|Fresh
By the end, [Marguerite will] have you crying like Pagliacci.|Fresh
It's handsomely turned out in its monochrome palette, and Marguerite's big numbers remain reliably amusing, Frot mangling her standards like a sham-dram Liza or Barbra while Marcon tersely clutches his hunting rifle in the wings.|Fresh
As Dumont, Catherine Frot grasps the character's tragic essence... Whether the director fully supports Frot's empathy, however, is more difficult to assess.|Rotten

Marguerite's unspeakable voice is counterpointed by cinematographer Glynn Speeckaert's exquisitely composed tableaux. And the denouement yields more than one surprise.|Fresh
It may be a little conventional, but the main character is too fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Marguerite is a cruel and yet noble comedy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director Xavier Giannoli stays away from the extravagance of the main character and creates a more faithful portrait. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Giannoli keeps the story with a fun and friendly tone. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An irregular tale about frustration, loneliness and lies. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Smart, moving and fun. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An entertaining movie with detailed production design and good performances. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A story that looks like a comedy, but it's really a tragedy. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Beautifully performed and sumptuously shot, Marguerite is a dramatic delight - amusing, moving and, above all, entertaining.|Fresh
A satire that Xavier Giannoli takes to its limits. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It manages to balance loud comedy with an intimate drama. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An exciting story transformed into a romantic comedy of sorts with some surreal moments. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A passionate film. For its subject and how it explores it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A fun and particular reflection about art. Opera in this case. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Something at once comic and surprisingly thoughtful -- a work of great delicacy and generosity. There's a magical, almost luminous, quality to Frot's portrayal.|Fresh
A film of chaste passion and (admittedly misplaced) artistic devotion. There is something rather touching and maybe even inspiring about the portrait that emerges.|Fresh
"""Marguerite"" tells us that if we work hard and believe in ourselves, we can achieve our dreams. Even if we stink."|Fresh
Catherine Frot is exceptional in the lead in the most literal sense of the word: she's the exception to an otherwise awful movie.|Rotten
Even if Madame Marguerite has some flaws, its virtues stand out with a better result. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The tragicomic reasons for Marguerite's pitch-imperfect warblings are beautifully communicated to the audience by the irresistible Frot.|Fresh
Xavier Giannoli hasn't settled for lavish and funny alone but has also aimed high to make his film surprisingly deep.|Fresh
This could be a weird or sad tale, but it is so well done that, unlike Marguerite's voice, it is more or less pitch perfect.|Fresh
Frot gives Marguerite a grandeur, but also an anxious, lost quality, emphasised by Glynn Speeckaert's cinematography with its heavy shadows and tendency to isolate Frot in the middle of the wide screen.|Fresh
It's a tale of great sadness -- about somebody enchanted by a world she's forever barred from entering.|Fresh
Frot is particularly telling in what might also be called Marguerite's last act - her voice both heartfelt and horrendous as comedy gives way to tragedy. The result is quietly heartbreaking.|Fresh
Winner of four Cesar Awards in France (Nominated for 11), Marguerite is clearly an accomplished work, taking a real American story as its inspiration - and then imaging it in French culture|Fresh
Based on a true story about a wealthy Baroness with more money than musical talent, it's comic and tragic all at once as the ripple effect of one little deception impacts on a woman's self esteem, her marriage and the fortunes of the hangers on|Fresh
Attitude and aptitude collide in Marguerite, a French drama whose absurdity and tender feelings are more in tune than the story's title character.|Fresh
Marguerite -- despite its longueurs -- offers much to enjoy, particularly Frot's ripe, passionate performance.|Fresh
A funny but thankfully merciful film about a wealthy society lady (Catherine Frot) who - convinced of her talent as a singer - subjects her acquaintances to ear-splitting recitals of her music.|Fresh
The late apparition of its protagonist only amplifies this disaster ridden attempt to honor the opera genre. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
"Giannoli leaves us to ponder Marguerite's philosophy: ""Either we dream life or we accomplish it."""|Fresh
A funny, thoughtful, moving story about art, love, passion, delusion and the sad reality that dreams and personal talents don't always jibe.|Fresh
A biting yet strangely affectionate period piece about delusion and love.|Fresh
Xavier Giannoli's 127-minute comedy Marguerite would have worked like gangbusters at a zippy 90 minutes, but it's a pleasant enough comedy-of-manners for most of its running time.|Fresh
A bravura dramedy that beautifully balances tragedy and comedy and asks a tricky question: Is it better to be cynical about art, or happily undiscriminating?|Fresh
Why is Marguerite so funny to us, and why is her public humiliation allowed to continue for so long? The answers plumb both the best and worst instincts of human nature, and give Giannoli's film a strong heartbeat.|Fresh
"So much of ""Marguerite,"" from dramatic focus to tech achievements, is handled with care by Giannoli, who finds more substance in understanding than crude mockery."|Fresh
It's a good joke, but more importantly, the first time that [writer/director Xavier] Giannoli allows us to laugh at Marguerite is also the last time.|Fresh
It piles too much on its serving plate, and at 129 minutes it's definitely overlong. But it has Frot, an actress with the wise, patient eyes of a cat, and she invests Marguerite with the multiple meanings the rest of the film elegantly fumbles.|Fresh
In the end, the movie gives voice not just to Marguerite's deficiencies as a singer but also to emotional frailties that are too human and familiar.|Fresh
"""Marguerite"" achieves what the protagonist herself never managed: perfect pitch."|Fresh
Frot's performance is so towering, so convincing, that it smooths out all the film's rough edges. It's a triumph.|Fresh
"The film is a little long; a couple of subplots could be shed with no problem. But ""Marguerite"" is a shining star, a film that will set you laughing and thinking in equal measure."|Fresh
Richly appointed, emotionally confrontational, often rollickingly funny, Marguerite is candied tragicomedy,|Fresh
A sumptuous and captivating film that benefits from excellent performances and costume design that perfectly encapsulates the jazz era of 1920s Paris.|Fresh
The film looks beautiful. Although it is a little too long, the emotional richness is skilfully delivered and it will stay with you for a long time after the final credits.|Fresh
This very handsome period film had a kind of Downton Abbey watch-ability but is pretty silly, and becomes an out-and-out pantomime at the end.|Fresh
Funny and touching with exquisite production design and impeccable performances, Marguerite is a civilised delight.|Fresh
Giannoli and Frot ensure that Marguerite is never the butt of the joke. On the contrary, she embodies something admirably unruly - a devotion to music that transcends the stifling disappointments of real life.|Fresh
Marguerite is a handsomely shot period affair with all the trimmings. At its core, though, it is a very delicate study of a woman who refuses to accept any of the constraints that her class, gender or lack of talent should place on her.|Fresh
This film, ably directed by Xavier Giannoli, is also based on the Jenkins story, but has switched the setting from Manhattan to Paris and changed the subject's name to Marguerite Dumont (a top-class turn from Catherine Frot).|Fresh
Marguerite suffers from a storytelling tameness that erodes the power of its subject.|Rotten
Frot is superb as the oblivious chanteuse, with her touchingly excruciating warbling hiding a pain that cannot be staunched after she discovers her husband's shortcomings.|Fresh
It's a film that relies on our sympathy for her and she flawlessly commands it, without ever resorting to sentimentality.|Fresh
It has the dramatic density, social sweep and sardonic bite of great French fiction. Think Balzac, Maupassant.|Fresh
Beneath the antic plot and sentimental portrayal of her marriage is a moving portrait of a woman who searches for an audience and loses herself.|Fresh
Most poignantly, we come to feel that it has been Marguerite's long-ignored need for love that has contributed at least in part to her behaviour.|Fresh
Its sober tone matches the muted, digitally colorized palette, deflating any expectation of a campy confection.|Fresh
Poses sharp questions about the nature of art and who it's for.|Fresh
This sumptuous story of an incompetent songbird will warm your heart as surely as it hammers at your eardrums.|Fresh
"Biopics and historical films almost exclusively center on subjects who did something exemplary or were talented at their pursuits. But what sets ""Marguerite"" apart is its focus on a woman whose most notable feature is her utter lack of talent."|Fresh
Witty, charming and delightful. Catherine Frot is at her best with a charismatic, heartfelt performance.|Fresh
A touching portrait of a woman with a dream... leading lady, Catherine Frot, is perfection.|Fresh
Pezzini is a terrific comic creation: an arrogant, money-grubbing divo who, by encouraging Marguerite, must fight every fiber of his being. And yet even here, Giannoli doesn't aim strictly for laughs.|Fresh
A compelling French dramedy about the yearning of a woman who is passionate about opera music.|Fresh
Frot salvages any of the film's shortcomings with her nuanced performance of Marguerite, a sweet and isolated woman completely oblivious to her lack of talent.|Fresh
Meryl Streep will soon play Jenkins in another movie, but it's hard to imagine anyone improving on the mix of hilarity and heartbreak this transplanted, fictional version achieves.|Fresh
"If someone had said to Marguerite early on, ""Listen. You can't sing,"" would it have made a difference? Would she have been happy? But Marguerite is undeniably happy when she sings. It's an ethical quandary, one the film has a lot of fun exploring."|Fresh
A thoughtful examination of an unusual, deeply eccentric woman.|Fresh
What redeems it is Ms. Frot's subtle, deeply compassionate portrayal of a rich, lonely woman clutching at an impossible dream until reality intrudes.|Fresh
"""Marguerite,"" in French with English subtitles, declares itself to have been ""inspired by a true story."" That usually means the story's truth was buried beneath layers of contrivance, but the key word here is ""inspired."""|Fresh
Frantic and compellingly unpredictable, even as it heads into comfortable territory.|Fresh
It's an often witty, smoothly shot film with a couple of extraneous subplots and some last-act psychology that feels contrived. But Frot shines.|Fresh
Xavier Giannolli consistently glosses every sequence with a stagey kind of humor, albeit at the main character's expense.|Rotten
Marguerite is a film for those sour enough to enjoy schadenfreude but with enough conscience to prefer that it not be too tragic -- and even a little charming.|Fresh
Xavier Giannoli offers up an amusingly entertaining portrait of fortune, infamy and severe melodic dysfunction in the polished French period dramedy, Marguerite.|Fresh
[A] pitch-perfect comedy of manners.|Fresh
The fairly suspenseful last act of the movie hinges on just a few changes of expression that unfold slowly across Frot's face.|Fresh
Despite its running time, the film's suspense lasts until the final frames. The musical score -- both on-and-off key -- is splendid.|Fresh
This is the tragic story of a woman with a dream -- a vision -- but absolutely no skills to achieve it.|Fresh
Marguerite will enchant quality-seeking viewers appreciative of originality, spectacle and serious music.|Fresh
"Featuring Mozart's gorgeous music, ""Marguerite"" is a comedy cum pathos based on the ambitions of a rich woman who thinks she has an operatic voice and an audience of sycophants who refuse to tell her the truth."|Fresh
an emotional thriller, a souffl of a farce, and a profound consideration of the fathomless yearnings of the human heart|Fresh
She was basically the original William Hung.|Fresh
