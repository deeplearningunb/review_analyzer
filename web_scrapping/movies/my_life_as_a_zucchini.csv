These weird-looking little clay people reach a level of emotional realism many human actors fail to achieve, and your time with them will be very worthwhile.|Fresh
Written by Celine Sciamma (Girlhood), My Life avoids the cliches about children in care, and those who look after them, in favour of a story that does not shirk from bleakness as it inches towards the light.|Fresh
Claude Barras' colorful stop-motion animation isn't your typical children's film. It both celebrates the potential of new beginnings while refusing to shy away from the disturbing realities that caused such transitions in the first place.|Fresh
My Life as a Zucchini has grace and charm, but what breaks your heart is its mental toughness.|Fresh
Between the dark and the luminous; between fatalism and hope. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Never panders or becomes cloying on its way to a well-earned 'we are family' conclusion.|Fresh
The movie is dark, but in a nurturing way, if that makes sense. It's suitable for kids because Zucchini is largely about healing - not in a sticky-sweet way, but by small, slow increments.|Fresh
My Life as a Courgette is a tender, funny and wise-beyond-its-years stop-motion animation that takes on tough subject matter through the eyes of a child.|Fresh

This is a film that finds hope and wonder and joy in a world that can be harsh and unfair and director Claude Barras acknowledges both.|Fresh
... a fascinating venture in social realism.|Fresh
French screenwriter (and frequent director) Céline Sciamma excels at making coming-of-age films.|Fresh
Charmingly homespun, the stop-motion animation is intricate and expressive, allowing the kids' unique personalities to shine forth from their petite frames and oblong heads.|Fresh
Yes, there are echoes of classic orphan tales of old but, despite the cleverness of the animation, the often doleful tone feels too real and grown-up to attract much in the way of a commercial audience.|Rotten
My Life As A Courgette isn't a kid's film - it's a family film, fit for viewing together and evoking discussion, reflection and consideration.|Fresh
Downright Dickensian, treating with serious dignity the darkest kind of childhood, one stripped bare of love or any kindness.|Fresh
Barras' technique is a sophisticated update of classic stop-motion clay animation...It's a laborious process-especially for a small, independent studio like Barras' with only 10 staff animators. But the result is obviously a labor of love.|Fresh
My Life as a Zucchini emerges as a touching picture of childhood, complete with its pains and consolations -- and (amazingly) an allowance for kindness.|Fresh
It stands out for its simplicity and sobriety, with animation in traditional Stop motion that without making use of elaborate scenographies, fulfill their function to tell us this story and works great. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film is a beautifully balanced visual marvel.|Fresh
A beautiful surprise with moments of sweetness, where the orphans learn to comfrot each other. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Colourful, emotive and nuanced, My Life As a Courgette is a Swiss/French stop-motion film that doesn't shy away from the sobering realities of many children in care homes.|Fresh
Hankies at the ready.|Fresh
The upfront acknowledgement in My Life as a Courgette that many childhoods play out with nary a hint of magic, sparkle or sugar to help the medicine go down feels unorthodox and bracing.|Fresh
It is, admittedly, cute and tender, a smooth and sensitive approach to the lives of abandoned children who are thinking and dealing with issues they should simply never have to contemplate.|Fresh
This isn't just good writing, it's humane and honourable. Every child here feels like a real human being, and as such is accorded a dignity the world invariably hasn't extended to them in their lives to date.|Fresh
"Barras succeeds brilliantly in his stated ambition to ""make a film about children that speaks to them about abuse and its remedies in today's world""."|Fresh
Painstakingly made using a stop-motion animation style similar to that favoured by Tim Burton, My Life as a Courgette is not at all as grim as it sounds, and focuses more on hope and kindness than the dark starts to the children's lives.|Fresh
My Life as a Courgette isn't perfect (some of the adult characters lack nuance) but its attempt to redefine innocence is stirring.|Fresh
Visually arresting, with a lovely strings soundtrack, it's a very accomplished piece of work.|Fresh
It is a lovely little film, coming in at a novella-size 66 minutes.|Fresh
My Life as a Courgette could be described as slight, given that the running time is just over an hour, but it is a beautiful, heartfelt film that deals with some difficult subjects.|Fresh
It is funny but conveys important sentiments about trauma, survival, the kindness of strangers and our shifting sense of what a loving family can be. Highly recommended.|Fresh
Somewhere in the mysterious space between the script and the animation, My Life as a Courgette boasts moments of (yes, whisper it) essential human truth that will leave you floored.|Fresh
The emotional heft of the story doesn't detract from the charm of the protagonists, with the film's humour and joy jumping off the screen, as oversized and unmissable as the characters' adorable faces.|Fresh
It's a little masterpiece.|Fresh
The only downside to this charming and disarmingly thought-provoking gem is that it lasts a mere 66 minutes. Few would complain if a sequel came along.|Fresh
A superlative family film, and one that dares to be different.|Fresh
Claude Barras' Oscar-nominated stop-motion animated feature is as poignant and as well observed a film about the darker side of childhood as you could ever hope to see.|Fresh

Claude Barras has created an important film of its kind for his compassionate way of representing a broken childhood. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Its Claymation images, bizarrely imagined as they are, can't begin to mask the range of emotions Barras' characters want to convey.|Fresh
A crude drama told with charming simplicity. It shows us the human bestiality through its most innocent victims in a sweet and tender way that moves. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Tough issues are not dismissed, but handled with delicacy and honesty.|Fresh
Fans of stop-motion animation will be pleased to know they have another gem on their hands. My Life as a Zucchini is a bit darker than your usual kids movie, but it is a wonderful thing to watch.|Fresh
With so much treacly sentimentality contained in animated films these days, it's refreshing to see one that engages adults and children in a sensitive, intelligent way.|Fresh
"Yes, it's an odd title, one that sounds much better in its native language (""Ma vie de Courgette""). It's also a wonderful tremendously moving film about an emotionally wounded little boy, and the family unit that develops at a foster home for orphans."|Fresh
I asked myself, why nominate a film like My Life As A Zucchini for an Academy Award? After viewing the film, it is a step above the rest for me, as it's unafraid to tackle themes where the other films just scratch the surface.|Fresh
More than a plot's complications, his characters are complex, almost as if the result of inspired anthropological study. Telling details... add to Barras' assured telling in his brief, lovely film. Families, sometimes, form themselves.|Fresh
My Life as a Zucchini...is nearly perfect, perhaps the best animated film in years.|Fresh
The mood is closer to the gentle melancholy of Peanuts, with which Zucchini shares a wistful air and pumpkin-sized craniums|Fresh
The intrinsic cuteness of the style and surface -- not to mention the title -- of My Life as a Zucchini belies the film's broken, despondent heart.|Fresh
Barras's most impressive feat-besides keeping the film under 70 minutes-is how effortlessly he gives the film to Zucchini, never once letting the corruption of the adult world stain My Life as a Zucchini's lively hues and livelier magnanimity.|Fresh
A bit like an animated Short Term 12, focused on the residents instead of the staff. But it's also its own lovely little thing.|Fresh
This French movie uses remarkably expressive stop-motion animation to create an honesty and sense of whimsy that help offset the darkness of the intrinsic story.|Fresh
Animated films have the stigma that they're only for kids, but My Life As a Zucchini proves that it can be just for adults too.|Fresh

"""Zucchini"" is timeless in its gritty, realistic examination of how children process tragedy and disappointment."|Fresh

Barras' direction keeps the film from being neither sentimental nor heavy-handed as it weaves an exquisite, compassionate tale about overcoming tragedy to find a new sense of family.|Fresh
Captivating and wonderfully dark Oscar-nominated take on childhood fears and romance. In French from Switzerland.|Fresh

Kids don't always need talking animals for entertainment. The more challenging, rewarding goal is to meet children halfway, seeing them without judgment for who they are.|Fresh
Alcoholism. Grief. Loss. Not the first subjects you think of when you're watching an animated children's film. But Claude Barras' My Life as a Zucchini incorporates all three with an enormous amount of tenderness.|Fresh
"It may not sound like it, but calling this barely 70-minute Swiss stop-motion film ""heavy"" - as in substantial and almost swollen with feeling - is a true compliment."|Fresh
It's well worth seeking out for older kids who don't mind reading subtitles, their parents, and any adults who can appreciate a good story movingly and creatively told.|Fresh
There may be a few overly wistful moments here, but in the main it's an affecting portrait of a group of unlucky but resilient children.|Fresh
It's a lovely little animated film, but it is French, so at any moment its cast of 9-year-olds can suddenly start talking about sex.|Fresh
Sometimes the simplest and most predictable stories can resonate far past their apparent limitations. My Life as a Zucchini is one of those.|Fresh
It's a brief film, clocking in at barely 70 minutes, but Zucchini is also far more heartfelt and resonant than so many cacophonous family films.|Fresh

The animation technique is in some ways cruder than the digital dazzle that kids see all the time, but also more soulful.|Fresh
Some of the happenings are unlikely in any culture, but as seen from a child's eye, this Zucchini stands tall.|Fresh
The movie is a pleasure to look at, and often genuinely sweet, but it's also akin to scaring the crap out of a little kid for 30 seconds and then smothering her with cotton candy for an hour.|Fresh

The main reason to commit to this movie's tough story of orphan loneliness is the screenplay by Céline Sciamma, herself a major French talent devoted to tales of youthful resilience (Girlhood).|Fresh

A sad story about abandonment and loss of innocence where love saves everything, with animation full of different textures that enrich and soften the Fontaines orphanage's characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
