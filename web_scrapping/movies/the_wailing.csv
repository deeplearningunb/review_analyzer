The Wailing lives up to its title, puts South Korea back on the horror genre map and I cannot recommend this film enough. Believe the hype. I loved this hideous thing.|Fresh
The Wailing's is a world where histories, identities, cultures, realities and generic codes and conventions collapse in spectacular, unforgettable style.|Fresh
... more than a horror film, Na Hong-jin's third film (The Casher, The Yellow Sea) is an alloy of genres... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
... although overlong and not without flaws, there is enough in The Wailing to warrant a viewing, and the subtle force of the film confirms Na Hong-jin's reputation as a director to be reckoned with.|Fresh
The film is exquisitely wrought, with a deep focus that draws the eye into the frame.|Fresh
The film stands out for being a singular work that has a great visual impact with masterful frames and an interesting use of color. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's something deeply sinister going on in The Wailing and I'm reluctant to divulge too much, because this is a film that's best enjoyed without prior knowledge of what's in store.|Fresh
Although the result is below The Chaser and The Yellow Sea, it's still a good example of the genre cinema of that origin. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The reasons to see this are Na's expert buildup of sickening dread.|Fresh
Very crazy, very Korean, very long: 156 minutes of murder, diabolism, exorcism and things that go bump by day and night.|Fresh

In just three films, Na Hong-jin has emerged as one of South Korean cinema's best kept secrets.|Fresh
As great as any horror movie of the 2010s to date.|Fresh
Packed with everything from gorgeously moody landscapes to an increasingly dark atmosphere.|Fresh
This is dark and disturbing and surprisingly long-over 2 1/2 hours-and directed with a slow build that churns up the tension as it shifts suspicion around.|Fresh
The Wailing's strength lies in its eclectic mashup of familiar horror tropes and fresh twist on small-town crime drama.|Fresh
Overall, The Wailing is a deeply flawed but nonetheless compelling film which will cement Na's reputation as a force to be reckoned with.|Fresh
A complex Korean horror with the surreal village feel of Twin Peaks.|Fresh
The well-created atmospheres of bleak desolation, shivery seat-edged thrills and sheer-intensity of spirit-world dabbling paper over the more nonsensical sections of the scattershot narrative that does eventually build to quite a chilling crescendo.|Fresh
The layers of dissembling and self-dissembling pile up so thickly that not only does Na evidently touch on something integral about the nature of evil, but actually seems to be in the process of summoning it before your eyes.|Fresh
By turns funny and despairing, this village noir brings the horror of uncertainty.|Fresh
The result is striking, frustrating and - whisper it - ripe for remaking.|Fresh
This is a queasily funny, often exhausting but genuinely unnerving watch.|Fresh
The Wailing takes its time to burrow under your skin, but by the time it weaves its dark, potent spell, it leaves you with a lingering, unshakeable sense of dread that Hollywood horror films can rarely muster.|Fresh
A lesson of classic cinema, script, composition of planes, use of the sound and photography that rubs the perfection. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Wailing isn't quite dynamic enough to truly terrorise, but ... there are ferocious moments that puncture the stillness.|Fresh
The results are two-fold: firstly, it's an entrancing experience elevated beyond the simple mechanics of what's expected, secondly, it makes a huge group of contemporary western thrillers seem comparatively dispensable.|Fresh
Farce frequently threatens to intervene, but the thunderous shamanistic rituals give you your money's worth.|Fresh
The Wailing features some fine direction from Na Hong-jin, gorgeous cinematography, and an intriguing mystery, but it all ends up being smothered in an excessive 157-minute runtime that the story simply can't fill.|Rotten
THE WAILING doesn't rely on many jump scares and what makes it so horrifying is the story. It challenges Heaven and Hell, good versus evil, God, and the Devil, and faith. I'm certain this would be John Milton's favorite film if he were alive today.|Fresh
Moments of body-horror and zombie-dom sometimes appall and sometimes seem B-movie-rated. But the possessed Hyo-jin strikes both fear and a kind of awe into the adults around her. If only the film were always so horrifyingly fascinating.|Fresh
A film that brings out the perverse roots of man's doom. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Wailing succeeds at combining a mood of deep unease with visceral gore, buddy cop comedy, and a hallucinogenic mix of horror tropes - a recipe that yields, among other things, an atypical exorcism helmed by an intense Korean shaman.|Fresh
It's a dish with many complex flavors that may seem odd when you see it on the menu, but once you try it, you're not going back to anything else.|Fresh
The kind of serious, A-quality horror studios shy away from. A throwback to movies like THE EXORCIST and THE SHINNING.|Fresh
The ensuing suspense and the enveloping paranoia and spookiness -- stretched out by the exhaustive length of the film here -- mean that this film really sucks you in. Even better, there is a terrifically gripping payoff right at the end.|Fresh
This is another superb film from Na Hong-jin.|Fresh
Na takes his sweet time, more than 2â€‰ 1/2 hours, to build to his shattering climax -- and yet not a minute of it feels wasted or superfluous. By the end of The Wailing, the audience knows it has been taken on a dark and twisted ride.|Fresh
Doleful humour, abrasive familiarity, and an avoidance of horror tropes such as shock cuts, anchors the film's mood in the everyday, even as the atmosphere relentlessly darkens.|Fresh
Neighborly distrust, profane banter and insults, dark omens, bedeviled dreams, overt Biblical portent and doomed police investigation|Fresh
Running a little too long for a scary movie, this film combines precious insight into small town Korean life combined with well-done bad spirit juju.|Fresh
... features some clever twists that consistently ratchet up the tension without succumbing to genre pitfalls.|Fresh
The film's chaos is offset by often majestic visual grace.|Fresh
Na certainly has fun with an onscreen world whose rules keep getting rewritten with each new iteration of evil.|Fresh
Better, different and stranger than most exorcist horror pics.|Fresh
[CANNES 2016] While far from a perfect film, this unconventional exploration in horror sends cinematic chills that run right through you.|Fresh
The Wailing is a grab-you-by-the-throat stunner, by far the best thrill machine of the year so far.|Fresh
A nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat wallop, The Wailing is the most frightening movie of the year.|Fresh
The Wailing is a soon to be discovered gem that is riveting, brilliantly written, impeccably acted, and masterfully filmed. The Wailing is without a doubt one of the year's best films.|Fresh
[Writer/director Hong-jin] Na is not concerned with finding a logical through line for his supernatural tale. He's looking to uncover the emotional one.|Fresh
There was a point in The Wailing where I was ready to declare this one of the best exorcism films of all time. It's still high up there for the genre. But then it just kept going and going and going.|Fresh
Like 'Green Room,' it's an extreme genre piece where the heroes are regular folks, who aren't equipped to handle something irregular.|Fresh
"Na trades in doubt and especially despair more than in what we think of as ""horror."" He isn't out to terrify us. He's out to corrode our souls, much in the same way that his protagonist's faith is corroded."|Fresh
"""The Wailing"" is the rare commercial thriller whose feverish manipulations can't be dismissed as merely callous or exploitative."|Fresh
The Wailing is a Hell of a ride, but Na should have given more thought to its destination.|Fresh
The Wailing is a wild ride, but it's no generic scare machine.|Fresh
"reminiscent of ""Memories of Murder"" with its comical cops, awful crimes, rural locations and incessant rain, ""The Wailing"" adds a supernatural aspect which Hong-Jin keeps twisting, throwing us and his protagonist off balance until the very last moments."|Fresh
"""The Wailing"" is something like the most gruesome and gripping Scandinavian crime drama you can imagine, transported to a rain-sodden Asian backwater where everyone's in a bad mood and science, religion and superstition are locked in uneasy combat."|Fresh
Swirling an air of majesty, The Wailing is poetry in motion - if your prose were full of mangled corpses, undead spirits, and tales of sinister takeovers.|Fresh
If you're a serious horror fan, then you absolutely must add The Wailing to your must-see list this year.|Fresh
The Wailing might be a somewhat meandering and nonsensical genre recombination, but that spell never breaks over its lengthy running time.|Fresh
there's real beauty and devastation in the film's finale, as the harrowing father-daughter relationship reaches its apex|Fresh
Both a high-minded zombie flick and a visceral lament for broken family bonds.|Fresh
Its sheer intensity and ambiguous narrative might put off some viewers, but this latest film could well be regarded as one of the best films to emerge from Korea in recent years.|Fresh
The Wailing is long and involving, permeated by a tense, sickening sense of foreboding, yet finally registers on a slightly lower key than the director's acclaimed genre films The Chaser and The Yellow Sea.|Fresh
A journey fraught with atmosphere, mystery, grim discoveries... and maybe a few laughs?|Fresh
Visually speaking, the lurid spookfest is an absolute stunner.|Fresh
Na Hong-jin's The Wailing is a work of thriller maximal-ism, a rare case of more actually being more rather than less.|Fresh
Na Hong-jin's spellbinding and scatterbrained new film is 156 minutes of demented occult nonsense that gradually begins to feel less like a linear scary story than that it does a ritualistic invocation of the antichrist.|Fresh
A bullet train of laughs, gore, frights and folklore.|Fresh
Korean genre maestro Na Hong-jin turns his attention to a nonsensical yet entertaining supernatural thriller.|Fresh
