The Babadook is very rich, and while it pulls on a number of other resources, it delivers its own unique aesthetic and storyline.|Fresh

The proceeding thrills are economically constructed but extremely effective.|Fresh
Kent is tapping into something far more unnerving than serial killers or the supernatural: the everyday terror of being a parent.|Fresh
This isn't to say it's only about how disturbing it can be to be a mom; it's also not only about how difficult it can be to be a mom to a child who reminds you each day of your most dire trauma... The film is also about institutions that fail to serve.|Fresh
Rarely outside of drama do we see the kind of imperfect motherhood shown in The Babadook, which is what makes this Repulsion-like household of horrors so frightening.|Fresh

The Babadook will trap you in its pages with its compelling performances. but like every kid's book, your happy ending is waiting for you on the last page.|Fresh
...essentially a two-hander about a mother and child, with the film's supernatural aspects serving to amplify aspects of that relationship.|Fresh
[Blu-ray Review] Superlative picture, skin-crawling audio courtesy of Mister Babadook himself, and a slew of special features delving into the project's creation add up to a must-own release.|Fresh
