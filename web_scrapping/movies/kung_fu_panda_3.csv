Kung Fu Panda 3 may not have the same emotional impact as the first two films or the higher-level Pixar productions, but is still a solid bit of family entertainment.|Fresh
Thankfully, Kung Fu Panda 3 is just as fresh and frothy the third time around. Quite frankly, this infectious kiddie karate chop to the giddy soul is rather charming.|Fresh
It doesn't quite have the originality of the first film or the boldness of the second, but it still has heart where it counts.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 pushes the series forward towards its potential as a centerpiece of biculturalism.|Fresh
It really is a treat to watch, the care and attention are at their highest level and the wistful, emotionally beguiling visuals as integral to the film as the tip top voice work and articulate story.|Fresh
Mercifully, the entire enterprise is rescued by the arrival of some baby pandas. You can never go wrong with baby pandas, as Hitchcock never said.|Rotten
Although a slightly over-dramatic ending holds the film back from greater heights, this is on the whole, quite enjoyable for kids as well as adults.|Fresh
Animated movies especially, suffer the greatest drop in quality with sequels. But Kung Fu Panda 3 is a definite exception to the rule. The third instalment is just as quirky, funny and engaging as the first one.|Fresh
Long on pandas but distinctly short of magic, humour and, notably, the sort of visual spectacle we've come to expect.|Rotten
There's nothing wrong with #3, but there's nothing especially delightful for surprising about it, either. And it's definitely not original.|Rotten

The story moves along nimbly, punctuated by beautiful moments of family bonding.|Fresh
Building on character development and plot points from the first two films, this story manages to feel both like a complete tale in and of itself and like the successful continuation.|Fresh
Directors Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni give Po's adventures the same gorgeously stylized look as in the previous films and find good humor in Po's unexpected return to his fellow pandas.|Fresh
While the newness of the original film is long gone, this third installment is not just the culmination of the series but the best of them... and the perfect place to stop.|Fresh
From the stunning gravity-defying battle sequences in the Spirit Realm to the lovely landscapes of the idyllic panda village, it's the rare animated movie worth seeing in 3-D.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 concludes on a definite high note, filled with eye-popping animated set pieces as well as thrilling story beats that I was perfectly entertained by.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 revisits the same themes as its predecessors ... But that familiarity doesn't lessen the film's emotional impact and solid laughs.|Fresh
It's hard to be cynical about Kung Fu Panda 3-it's part of a series that is so good-hearted and fun and it clocks in at a loose 90.|Fresh
A moving character study and an exciting action-adventure-comedy, and it is also desperately gorgeous.|Fresh
From the colourful, psychedelic realm of the spirits to the playground-like panda kingdom, the art here is stylish and arresting.|Fresh
A cynical cherry-picked mish-mash of China's spiritual treasures for Hollywood's bottom line, rather than the sincere children's bedtime story it should be? It's still good.|Fresh
Part three gives a wider canvas to one of the best characters in the franchise, the high-strung and business-oriented Mr Ping.|Fresh
One of the most pleasing franchises in animation, Po and his stalwart companions mix Western and Eastern tropes together to create a pleasing amalgam with some of the industry's best animation, both traditional and modern.|Fresh
A plot as patchy as a panda doesn't mar the enjoyment of this third look at the animated high-kicking bear and his fighting animal friends. The animation ... is super-smooth.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 is no game-changer, but it's a solid entry into a consistently fun and funny animated franchise.|Fresh
It may serve up exactly the same mix of mayhem, noodles and dumplings as the first two films in the series, but Kung Fu Panda 3 is still energetic and wildly entertaining fare.|Fresh
Both the writing and the animation are especially strong this time around, drawing in bigger themes while still keeping things both thrilling and very silly.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda is that rare film that actually benefits from the 3D process.|Fresh
This nearly-five-years-later follow-up to the second effort's again flat and strained, although the animation is even snazzier.|Rotten
The third instalment in the beloved Kung Fu Panda franchise is as amusing and charming as ever.|Fresh
There is plenty in Kung Fu Panda 3 that echoes the first film and the sequel, but it's not tired recycling. Instead, the movie deftly reinforces and extends what has gone before.|Fresh
It's smart, colourful, easy fun for the whole family.|Fresh
We're treated to less of the same, and while that is disappointing, it doesn't deny this trilogy from being one of the best franchises to come out of DreamWorks Animation Studios.|Fresh
If the little-'uns aren't in the mood for a repeat viewing of the far-superior Zootopia, then this just about does the trick.|Fresh
A happy whirlwind of colour, 3D dazzle and Kung Fu madness, this third film in the panda franchise continues to blossom like its unlikely hero, who learns to become the best he can be, through his journey of self worth and belonging|Fresh
Another darn fun entry in this deservingly popular series.|Fresh

A great sequel that's on par with the other two films when it comes to quality. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 delivers and then some. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a role that Jack Black, who co-wrote, clearly relishes. Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan all return for what is a predictable but enjoyable, heart-warming story with lots of nice details and gorgeous colour.|Fresh
The film is simultaneously sweet, simple and savvy.|Fresh
The story is a little slight and rushed in places but it has (n)oodles of charm and good humour.|Fresh
The film's mixture of cheerful life coaching and action-packed adventure is sweet and winning.|Fresh
It's amiable, colourful fare, buoyed up by occasional moments of beauty, most of them in the dazzling background designs - both worldly and otherworldly.|Fresh
The animation is gorgeous, too, drawing its inspiration from sources as richly diverse as ancient Chinese scrolls and the fantastical landscapes found on Roger Dean's prog-rock album covers.|Fresh
The colors, the textures and the endearing characters are there, but soemthing seems to be missing in this sequel. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Dreamworks gets another hit with this sequel that wors perfectly. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It has several lessons which may well be directed to children or any viewer. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A beautiful movie aesthetically inspired by Chinese art and a strong message about believing in yourself. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's sweet, irresistible stuff, but the animation is absolutely spectacular, blending influences from ancient Chinese and Japanese art with a glorious palette of colours to create something truly special.|Fresh
Gaze in wonder at the beautiful woodcut-inspired landscapes, the 2D manga-style flashbacks, and the inventive choreography. Skidoosh, indeed.|Fresh
The inventive visual side is stirring, dazzling and vibrant, an exemplar of creative grandeur and finesse.|Fresh
Decent, generic fun for all the family.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 makes sure to continue the tradition of being perfectly pleasant for parents to sit through after being dragged to the multiplex by their kids.|Fresh
In terms of optical stimulation, there's something to please all of the people at least some of the time. Even when it all gets a bit Confucius.|Fresh
Po the chubby panda and his fellow anthromorphs return for another exhilaratingly silly DreamWorks adventure, this time with a formidable new villain to vanquish, in the form of Kai, an enormous, snorting, bull-like creature from the Chinese spirit world.|Fresh
A great 3rd part, exploring the character in new ways and showing us great action animated sequences. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Visually stunning, Kung Fu Panda 3 is also a very fun and entertaining movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is the weakest entry in the trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Kung Fu Panda 3 leaves us amazed by pushing the limits of the animators imagination when it comes to showing what they can do with martial arts. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Nothing short of a tranquilliser dart or a polo mallet to the back of the head is apparently going to stop the gobsmackingly successful Kung Fu Panda franchise.|Fresh
Starting in the exploding mountains of the spirit realm and concluding with a spectacular musical set piece - what else but Kung Fu Fighting? - this third instalment of the animated children's franchise knows how to impress.|Fresh
Rather than the cynical 'one last grab' of the series, Kung Fu Panda 3 might actually be the best.|Fresh
The first two films laid down a distinctive visual template which this pushes ever further into trippy, sliced-and-diced abstraction, nodding frenetically to the techniques of the wuxia martial arts genre.|Fresh
In spite of being the third entry in the series, the concept is still fresh and endearing. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In the case of Kung Fu Panda - it's never been in any doubt that there is the scope in this narrative to fulfil a third entry into the franchise, and warrant a return into this particular world.|Fresh
While the adventure is not as entirely 'Awesome!' as its predecessor, or as its hero proclaims it to be, it is - as he is also fond of exclaiming - 'Sweet!'|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 actually feels like part of the story, like it has a good reason to exist on its own, aside from just being an investment for a movie company.|Fresh
Endearing, action-jacked, and self-effacingly funny, Kung Fu Panda 3 simply reaffirms it has a Wuxi Finger Hold on the chop-socky, Taoist, slapstick kids-animation market.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 follows that same template almost to the letter and punctuation mark. But it's so engaging and entertaining that its reliance on that well-worn hero's journey narrative doesn't feel stale.|Fresh
Kung Pow! for Kung Fu Panda 3. The third in the series is all that!|Fresh
There's a rich, colorful narrative to experience through a character like Po, who's a klutzy goof on the outside, but is finding the graceful spirit within.|Fresh
The third installment ties up the tale of our beloved hero very nicely.|Fresh
If this sounds like a lot of eastern philosophy and religion, it is, but it is also a good story, with strong characters. There is also some kung fu action, of course, but the main story is about the spiritual journey of Po.|Fresh
Makes January at the movies a little brighter.|Fresh
Fun for the whole family! Funny, creative and by the film's end, you take away lessons for being a better person. A good time.|Fresh
As Perfect as Black is for Po, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a pretty good indication that everything runs its course. Time to let the bear live on as another actor's impression on Saturday morning TV.|Rotten
As the year of the goat gives way to the year of the monkey, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a nice way to celebrate the calendar turning.|Fresh
The only thing more adorable than one panda or a father-son pair of pandas is an entire village of the two-toned creatures.|Fresh
Absolutely the only thing wrong with Kung Fu Panda 3 is that it's the third film in a series that is starting to show the inevitable signs of strain.|Fresh
Like the first two, it's stylishly pretty to look at, and the over-the-top fight scenes and visual humor (courtesy of directors Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh) are amusing.|Fresh
Winded, out of ideas and laughs.|Rotten
With a moderate level of fun, the cuddly 'Kung Fu Panda 3' rises above unbearable.|Fresh
Sweetly supernatural, revolving around the concept of family and forgiveness, recommended for children over the age of six.|Fresh
'Kung Fu Panda 3' kicks in with ready-made anticipation from two successful predecessors and should please most kids and adults.|Fresh
Best. Panda. Ever. A threequel that beats the standard with fight, fun and loads of heart.|Fresh
This latest effort seems designed simply to meet fan expectations rather than try something new.|Rotten
A stylistic and creative extension of a unique franchise.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 may be the least of the three films, but it's still good family entertainment.|Fresh
Once again, it's fun to look at and full of wisecracks, which, coupled with the dueling-dads subplot, may be enough to see you through.|Fresh
Po now has an almost infinite number of movies to advance from Dragon Warrior to Master of Chi to...Ol' Dirty Bastard, which is what I assume the ultimate Shaolin title is.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 is a well-meaning piece of escapism for kids - one that shows signs of wear in the larger computer-animated kung fu franchise.|Fresh
slick, witty, and not afraid to embrace the essential silliness of a story that finds a Kung Fu rooster taking on a water buffalo, and a bug getting the best of a simian|Fresh
Fun, but It's the same movie over again. I've had enough dumplings, thanks. Ski-doosh.|Fresh
We've reached the point, somewhat prematurely, that comes in almost every movie franchise, where the sequels start to feel like episodes.|Rotten
Any spark or originality this series had has been wrung out by this point and is really of no value to anyone other than a desperate parent looking for 90 minutes of non-sensibility-offending distraction for their kids.|Rotten
The stunning visuals surpass the high standards set by its predecessors, but storywise, it breaks no new ground.|Fresh
Perfectly solid, diverting family entertainment with well-drawn characters, involving action, and some nice messages. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Scenes, etc. - Also Available)|Fresh
"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" continues the fun while completing a circle, but it fails to reach the trilogy's artistic pinnacle, ""Kung Fu Panda 2."""|Fresh
[It's] mostly like those dishes at my old Chinese buffet - stretched thin, badly reheated and really, best taken in very small quantities.|Rotten
Audiences may enter Kung Fu Panda 3 with their arms folded tightly against their chest. Here's betting they'll leave pining for more Po.|Fresh
The animation is still strong - there are some interesting and refreshingly uncuddly depictions of the spirit world from whence Kai springs - but, mainly, KFP3 is too much of a good thing.|Rotten
It's gloriously colorful, very funny and, better yet, unexpectedly substantive and genuinely moving.|Fresh
"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" doesn't quite raise the bar but that's only because the first two films set such an incredibly high standard."|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 provides a welcome reminder of what the talented artists at DreamWorks can do when they're given worthwhile material.|Fresh
Like the martial arts masters themselves, the film achieves a seemingly effortless balance.|Fresh
"Writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger ... unfurl the narrative with buoyant clarity, gentle charm and much endearing (read: sweetly hokey) humor. The tale's ""be yourself"" mantra, though nothing new, is also well used."|Fresh
The main reason families enjoy the series is Po, thanks to Jack Black's frenetic and friendly approach. There's just enough huggable and HiYa! moments to keep the animated film's core audience chomping on their popcorn and glued to the screen.|Fresh
A fun, vibrant sequel that's the perfect counterpoint to the darkly themed second entry, this series shows no sign of slowing down, as the tale of martial arts master Po takes an unexpected turn rife with possibilities.|Fresh
Could it be possible that a second sequel can be as good or better than its slightly above-average original? Kung Fu Panda 3 says yes! It's the Return of the King of the trilogy.|Fresh
Waaaaay too talky and overcomplicated.|Rotten
This is a visually stunning picture, a rhapsody of saturated color and contrasting texture, from the painstaking detail of coarse panda fur to the painterly dreamscape that is the spirit world.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 delivers a great message to young people, some of the most gorgeous animation out there, and action-comedy that will amuse those of all ages.|Fresh
Kung Fu Panda 3 brings a more-than-satisfactory conclusion to the story...|Fresh
"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" continues the Po saga, setting up for the next installment, of course, but in a way that makes you want more."|Fresh
The whole fightin'-bear jamboree is agreeable enough, but it takes some of the spotlight away from Black being Black, and doesn't jibe with messages about having a sense of self, of what makes you you.|Rotten
In Hollywood's franchise game, sequels are seldom the best they can be. This one isn't, but it's pretty, perfectly pleasant and good enough.|Fresh
Like a well-made dumpling, it's not too heavy but not too light, has the right amount of spice, and leaves one with some appetite for the next time.|Fresh
A visually stunning but story-wise pretty threadbare entry in the popular series.|Rotten
This is a nice, kid-friendly movie. But it also makes some disingenuous choices at key moments that deflate its value.|Rotten
DreamWorks' delightful Kung Fu Panda series has only gotten better with age|Fresh
Few animated franchises have the honor of reaching this milestone without a sharp decline in quality... Kung Fu Panda 3 remains relevant because it evolves with its audience, introducing deeper themes and messages.|Fresh
Features the same heart, humor and action of the first two films.|Fresh
Unfortunately, looks aren't everything. The plot is plodding and predictable.|Rotten
It's easy to mistake the simplicity of plot and theme here for simple-mindedness - this isn't Pynchon or Proust. Kung Fu Panda 3 has the economy of a Zen koan, not to mention its inner harmony and wisdom.|Fresh
The directors ... make sure to let Po stay the charming bumbler he's always been. That's what makes him such an earnest, lovable hero.|Fresh
The screening I attended was full of youngsters, and the only sound I heard from them was consistent laughter, not chatter. Sounded like an endorsement to me.|Fresh
As cute and fun as the Kung Fu Panda movies have been, this seems like a good time to walk away.|Fresh
"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" has a moment or two for everyone, but no chance develop any character beyond a single dimension. The next scene has often arrived before the viewer can process the last one."|Rotten
Kung Fu Panda 3 is often inspired as animation, and tired as everything else.|Rotten
"""Be the best you you can be"" is this movie's message, and writers Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Turner, and directors Alessandro Carloni & Jennifer Yuh heed their own advice throughout this brisk romp."|Fresh
Mostly, Kung Fu Panda 3 is just fun.|Fresh
While the story isn't completely engrossing, character charms and creative visual design remain as beguiling as ever.|Fresh
Black and white and fun all over, Kung Fu Panda 3 achieves best-of-franchise status with a story that goes deeper than typical kid fare, wrapped in beautifully crafted animation.|Fresh
Lots of comedic fight scenes break up the story's more somber stretches, and the animation, especially in 3-D, is simply gorgeous.|Fresh
At this point, there's really nothing new to discover in a Kung Fu Panda movie, but it's still nice to see old friends every so often.|Fresh
If Kung Fu Panda 3 feels like a step down, it's only because it's got a sterling pedigree to live up to.|Fresh
Though entertaining at times, Kung Fu Panda 3 isn't entirely different from watching that video of Tian Tian, the Smithsonian's National Zoo panda, rolling in the snow on an hourlong loop|Rotten
"The ""Kung Fu Panda"" formula works, still, and if directors Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh don't reinvent the panda-as-martial-artist wheel, they avoid making the story seem stale."|Fresh
A singular look, an exemplary vocal cast, and a narrative arc like a caress. That'll be the Kung Fu Panda franchise's legacy, the idea that shouldn't have worked but did, beautifully and with its own chi.|Fresh
Tightly written and marvelously imaginative, [Kung Fu Panda 3] is also one of the loveliest animated features to be released recently.|Fresh
Just complicated enough to reward steady viewers and just simple enough for parent escorts to enjoy without much prior knowledge.|Fresh
The three 'Kung Fu Panda' films are powerfully forgettable but they're also handsomely made, extremely pretty, elegantly designed and funny exactly when they need to be.|Fresh
While it lacks the wonder and nuance of earlier Pandas, there are enough new faces and wowing, Asian-influenced style to also keep parents amused for an hour and a half.|Fresh
A vividly entertaining adventure story with beautiful animation and a solid way to continue the arc of the titular protagonist.|Fresh
"""The best thing Kate Hudson has done in 16 years."""|Fresh
In studio movies, especially for children, all it takes to be great at something difficult is a good heart and a training montage. Go on, America, keep yelling at Common Core while parking your kids in front of this stuff.|Rotten
This is a bright and shining example of how to do a sequel right.|Fresh
It finds a benefit in its genre affiliation, evenly distributing its action in quick bursts of fluidly animated fight choreography.|Fresh
Upbeat but intense threequel looks at identity, family ties.|Fresh
While visually gorgeous and generally entertaining, this third installment of the DreamWorks Animation franchise is a comedown from the first two superb entries.|Fresh
Refuses to panda to the lowest common denominator.|Fresh
A winning lightness of touch prevails in this delightful continuation of the durable DreamWorks franchise.|Fresh
He's just a Po boy, from a Po family, who must spare him his life from that monstrosity.|Fresh
Fitfully amusing and certainly heartfelt, this latest chapter in the likable animated saga will work best with younger viewers, but its life lessons and emotional beats feel slathered on rather than deftly woven into the storyline.|Rotten
Between the witty screenplay, delightful visuals that jump back and forth between 3-D and 2-D animation, and a consistently game voice cast, this third serving never feels like a dull retread or a lazy cash grab.|Fresh
