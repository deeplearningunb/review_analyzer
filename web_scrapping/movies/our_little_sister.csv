A poetic and pleasant film that works as a tender and sensible entry in Koreeda's universe. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It really is filmmaking at the highest pitch of intelligence: a work teeming with skill both cinematographically and dramaturgically.|Fresh
When its repressed emotions finally come to the surface, it's devastating.|Fresh
Our Little Sister, a lovely example of vintage Kore-eda, explores tensions great and small that exist between different generations of a fractured family.|Fresh
"""Our Little Sister"" has one foot in 20th-century Japan, another in a new world that seems to be forming. It's often engaging, but just as often awkward and misshapen."|Fresh
Never shying away from the picturesque, the film depicts a vivid world that is crystal clear, gleaming, and suffused with life.|Fresh
Like his other films, Our Little Sister never draws attention to itself (or to its maker's understated brilliance).|Fresh
Our Little Sister has an unassuming wisdom beneath its winsome exterior. It's raw and heartbreaking and real, and that's commendable.|Fresh
"Emotional without getting sentimental, Our Little Sister is the sort of ""coming to terms"" therapy narrative that should be drooling claptrap, but Koreeda and his actresses make it seem honest and authentic."|Fresh

Filled with cherry-blossom gorgeousness and sentimental homages to small-town Japanese life, it's a film of quiet, telling moments, even when big revelations surface.|Fresh
[A] warmly enveloping exploration of grief, guilt and gradually letting go.|Fresh
It helps that Koreeda's way with atmosphere is in full effect. The film has tranquil settings, fresh-food meals, cherry blossoms and soothing breezes; watching it is a good way to clear your head.|Fresh
Our Little Sister is not so much a dramatic work as a cinematic tone poem. The point of the movie is not to get anywhere in particular, but just to enjoy the journey along the way.|Fresh
Often compared with Yasujir≈ç Ozu's domestic tales, Koreeda's films share that Chekhovian vibe, but his movies have more cinematic fluidity and highly tactile surfaces; he makes you feel things you might otherwise forget.|Fresh
There are minor conflicts and revelations, but these never seem like plot points. Rather they feel like the fabric of everyday life, observed with limpid simplicity and given powerful emotional effect with natural, easy, unforced performances.|Fresh
...practices the same virtue as its characters, realizing that life is lived in the small moments as well as the great ones, and that being present in your own life is the greatest gift of all.|Fresh
The most touching of family reunions.|Fresh
Kore-eda is one of the most optimistic and humanist filmmakers working today, and even though Our Little Sister isn't quite as finely articulated as some of his previous work, his core compassion for humanity comes through clearly.|Fresh
...a lyrical, plain-sung movie about people who are obliged to love one another. And do.|Fresh
While urgency is less of a priority this time out, the helmer still puts together an irresistible collection of characters and personal issues.|Fresh
'Our Little Sister' is a tender and restrained feature that flows by like a gentle stream, lulling you with its melodic cadence and drawing you into its beauty.|Fresh
Our Little Sister is a serene, enchanting film that transports us to another, gentler world.|Fresh
By the end, a Zen-like calm that might be mistaken for stasis settles over the story. But these lives move forward slowly, inexorably, and they move us, too.|Fresh
[Kore-eda] captures small interactions beautifully, and builds up a layered portrait of the main characters' everyday lives in those meaningful gestures and exchanges.|Fresh
Koreeda's restrained style and gentle pace may try some viewers' patience, but if you can roll with it, it's a lovely, poignant slice of life.|Fresh
Static, slow and slight, but with its own rewards.|Fresh
Even death is part of the flow, part of the process of getting along and finding a place in the world.|Fresh
While it lacks some of the more profound observations of Kore-eda's best work, the filmmaker's more gentle approach still allows his subtle humanity to shine through.|Fresh
Sublime, another rapturous family story from Japanese auteur Hirokazu Koreeda.|Fresh
As he eases toward his subtly stirring resolution, it's hard to resist getting swept up in the moment; for somewhere along the way, Kore-eda has brought us into the fold.|Fresh
Slight, serene and sweet, it's a subtly calming interlude...|Fresh
Our Little Sister does best in small, quiet moments.|Fresh
It's subdued, at times even too leisurely, but the film and its characters are luminous, especially lead Ayase Haruka.|Fresh
Audiences softened by Hollywood cynicism are bound to be confounded by filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda's (After Life, Like Father, Like Son) gentle, upbeat tone.|Fresh
With a delicate palette and soft tones, the craftsmanship on display is impeccable, but the pulse-free drama - think crying over spilled milk - makes for muted impact.|Fresh
The four girls in Our Little Sister make an impressive ensemble as their inclusive spirit and positive outlook restore a kind of equilibrium to a troubled hearth. It must be one of the films of the year.|Fresh
"The Brazilians have a word for the feeling Kore-eda evokes, saudade, a mixture of happiness and sadness, a love that remains once someone is gone. ""Our Little Sister"" is as close to perfect as a film can be."|Fresh
Moves at a rhythm akin to the gently lapping waves...yet somehow swiftly establishes the personalities of the three sisters, a contradiction that speaks to the resonance of the performers and Koreeda's skill at eliciting emotional truth.|Fresh
The pleasures of Kore-eda's film comes in meeting these characters-and they are considerable.|Fresh
The performances are solid throughout, and young Hirose's Suzu is an unassuming delight.|Rotten
Our Little Sister often feels Chekhovian, a movie attuned to the passage of time and the changing of seasons. As I watched it, though, I also thought, in a general way, of Thornton Wilder, [whose plays] are suffused with love and kindness.|Fresh
Koreeda's latest, Our Little Sister, is closer to the fairy tale tone of his nearly-flawless childhood adventure, I Wish, although this exploration of family obligation and loss is less challenging than his prior output.|Fresh
While the emotions may be muted, there's still something appealingly heartfelt about the way these siblings find each other. One can't help but cheer them on.|Fresh
As emotionally superficial as a Hollywood movie by the likes of Nancy Myers or Cameron Crowe.|Rotten
There is a great deal to be said for simple dishes, prepared well.|Fresh
Beneath its sugar-frosted quality, however, Our Little Sister has a singular character of its own.|Fresh
There are no great thunderbolts of emotion as in Koreeda's other work, but fans of the director's more heartrending movies may appreciate this buoyant palate cleanser.|Fresh
All one needs is a close-up of Suzu's face euphorically looking skyward, eyes closed, as she rides on a road surrounded by cherry blossoms to grasp the laudable humanity at the heart of Kore-eda's patient, warmhearted worldview.|Fresh
The nicest movie in theaters right now is 'Our Little Sister.' That's not to say it's not sad or dark or that its characters can't be prickly and neurotic.|Fresh
"Kore-eda may have moved away from the adventurous, mysterioso moodiness of early films like ""After Life,"" but the smiles he provokes here -- both with his characters and with us -- are well-earned."|Fresh
Japanese melodrama Our Little Sister is the rare film that captures the everyday pleasures and anguishes of family life.|Fresh
"Kore-eda's latest exudes the same sentimental, unhurried tone of ""Still Walking"" and ""Like Father, Like Son,"" and to be sure it's a simple tale without many surprises. But in his hands, that slightness can feel elemental, timeless."|Fresh
It's the way that Koreeda handles such quotidian details and detours of this quartet that makes all the difference.|Fresh
Seeming to wander through small incidents and mundane busyness, it acquires momentum and dramatic weight through a brilliant kind of narrative stealth.|Fresh
The movie bestows a forgiving compassion on all its troubled souls, even those of the misbehaving dead.|Fresh
A delicate, unforced meditation on the bonds of family and the joys and wonders hidden in everyday life, this film is able to move audiences without apparent effort, and that must be experienced firsthand to be appreciated and understood.|Fresh
Despite fine intentions and four lovely performances from the female leads, Our Little Sister is simply too light to be felt.|Rotten
[Our Little Sister's] comforting narrative holds few surprises, but builds remarkable emotional power.|Fresh
Anyone in the mood for two hours (and change) of sheer, unadulterated loveliness ... will be amply rewarded.|Fresh
Nobody could describe the movie as eventful (and viewers may be surprised to learn that it's adapted from a graphic novel), yet the thrust of Kore-eda's storytelling, as so often, is that even a quiet life can be a full one.|Fresh
The film's reserve softens some of its more piquant observations about tradition and mortality.|Fresh
A moving and achingly beautiful feast for the soul.|Fresh
An accessible piece of work by one of the medium's great masters.|Fresh
Put simply, Hirokazu Kore-eda has made another one of his films: delicate, heart-tugging, sweet but not cloying, a meandering stream of limpid water under which an eddy of emotions, unsettled pasts and unspoken worries swirl.|Fresh
Not a huge amount happens yet it is transfixing at times, largely a product of superbly moulded characters, gentle humour, refined performances and a charming devotion to human warmth.|Fresh
A deeply humane look at the way the shards of a broken family unit can be reconfigured into something warm, positive and functional.|Fresh
Is it sentimental? Of course, but never unbearably so thanks to the director's delicate touch.|Fresh
As its magical spell takes hold, so the film's true depths become apparent, each character dealing in their own way with the departure of a parent, and issues of love, loyalty and loss.|Fresh
It's a delightful film, excellently acted and charged with undercurrents of familial emotion.|Fresh
The film's gentle, empathetic tone might seem a little toothless compared to the peril or conflict of Koreeda's earlier work, but it's a warm, embracing joy of a movie to watch.|Fresh
Hirokazu Koreeda's Our Little Sister is a gentle, lyrical, beautifully shot story of three sisters who take in their 14-year-old half-sister, and find their past is not what it seemed.|Fresh
If you're in the market for a tranquil, meditative holiday but can't quite pony up the cost, this surprisingly engaging film will do just as well.|Fresh
A film that whispers its message, which is nice sometimes.|Fresh
An intelligent, quiet work from a master filmmaker.|Fresh
A quietly powerful and absolutely charming drama.|Fresh
An intimate, warm embrace of a film.|Fresh
The film is beautifully shot and framed, and the story it tells is universal and immensely appealing.|Fresh
Our Little Sister is an uneventful, if also overwhelmingly life-affirming, family portrait that once again establishes Koreeda as one of today's pre-eminent humanist filmmakers.|Fresh
Kore-ede manages to make every image surface little by little in comedic or dramatic situations that flow into each other naturally. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Highly recomended. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A delicate and femenine family melodrama. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
At a first glance it doesn't seem to be any purpose to the film, but this is a tale about family and a dysfunctional one at best. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Koreeda never tries to fool you with a big movie, he just wants to leave you with a discrete and permanent smile on your face. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film never explores the characters issues the way you wpould expect, opening the floor for debate and making the viewing experience much more entertaning. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An honest film, full of affection and one that doesn't try to hide the fact that it's all about showing the emotions of it's characters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hirokazu Koreeda explores masterfully themes like everyday life, and the delicate and fragile families can be.. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The work of a true artist. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Koreeda achieves an intimate and timely film that results in its way of illustrating the history of growth, life, death and the family. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This movie is more episodic and less plot-driven than his previous work but no less enjoyable. For some, Our Little Sister will be too slow, but anyone who can stick with it will be rewarded.|Fresh
Kore-eda seems to have bitten off more than he can chew, delivering an uneven and ultimately superficial story of emotional maturation.|Rotten
Offering up their hard-won home and refusing to let Suzu be saddled with her parents' baggage, grows more and more breathtaking in retrospect, a quiet act of grace and love that the film provides just the right showcase for.|Fresh
Slightly hampered by an episodic structure deriving from its source, Our Little Sister is nevertheless a seductive and engrossing celebration of family and community.|Fresh
Koreeda achieves a film that's endearing and on point to ilustrate a story about growing up, life, death, and family. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Perfectly pitched and bolstered by four beautiful lead performances, Our Little Sister, with the gentlest of touches, both breaks one's heart and makes it swoon.|Fresh
The most subtle comic adaptation you'll see all year.|Fresh
A methodically paced, quietly moving experience.|Fresh
Our Little Sister slowly-but-surely morphs from a passable character study into a seriously (and aggressively) interminable cinematic endurance test.|Rotten
The result is an episodic, generous-spirited, pristinely shot and, quite frankly, somewhat dull effort.|Rotten
There's no doubting the film's commitment to a compassionate understanding of the complexities of the human heart.|Fresh
Precisely because it's less emotionally coercive than Kore-eda's last couple of pictures, it's even more moving: rather than lunging full-bore for the solar plexus, the truths it's telling creep up on you.|Fresh
Kore-Eda's film is more than the beautifully luminous faces of his actresses, the particular way they move and speak, or the lovely landscapes of Kamakura, even though all of these should be admired.|Fresh
Hirokazu Kore-eda's latest fractured-family drama is a graceful yet somewhat emotionally muffled portrait of four siblings.|Fresh
There is such compositional flair here.|Fresh
