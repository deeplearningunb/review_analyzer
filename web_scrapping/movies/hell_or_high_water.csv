"""Hell or High Water"" is dynamic, well-paced, and builds momentum up until the final showdown where it then turns the intensity all the way up."|Fresh
It creates a story with characters that might not be all good or all bad, much in the way real life exists, but we care about them all.|Fresh
The complicated camaraderie and the love between the troubled brothers along with the action-thriller elements, has made this my favorite film of the year so far.|Fresh
Right up to its unsatisfying, to-be-continued ending, the film's lugubrious quality marks it as an example of grievance cinema, art-directed for a new era of violent self-pity, economic decline, and racial appropriation.|Rotten

With a smart and refined script by Taylor Sheridan that is both tense and sarcastic, and a cast of fully fleshed out characters that demand investment, the contemporary Western is an exceedingly enjoyable surprise.|Fresh

Hell or High Water: A Different Kind of Heist Thriller|Fresh
With distant echoes of Butch Cassidy and Jesse James, and haunting music from Nick Cave, this beautifully crafted film stays with you and should do great things for the career of its Scottish director, David Mackenzie.|Fresh

Labelled as a modern-day western, it might not bring anything new to the genre, but it's smart and ferocious and highly entertaining.|Fresh
The cast and crew craft a modern Western, and as with many films in that genre, plenty of challenges faced those involved. They, however, always ended with some semblance of hope.|Fresh
Hell or High Water hits a very high water mark for filmmaking.|Fresh
This is a movie so perfectly paced, so generous in the portrayal of its characters, so understated and intelligent and incisive that it's painful and lovely to watch.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is one of those rare movies that feels exactly right from the get-go.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is so busy taking inspiration from earlier movies that it forgets we've seen them too.|Rotten
It's a dirty, sweaty, violent, tragic tale, but vigorously realised.|Fresh
David Mackenzie's modern-day Western hits the high-water mark in terms of its uniformly fine performances if not, necessarily, its narrative construct.|Fresh
A real film, full of wit and insight, and carried by actors that rise above the pointedness of their dialogue to discover something profound within their limited ideologies.|Fresh
A precise western, accompanied by accurate and corrosive dialogues where Texas becomes an X-ray of an economically collapsed country. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Filled with dramatic tension, complex characters, rich, memorable dialogue and uncomfortable reflections of the plight of many modern day Americans, David Mackenzie's contemporary western is a compelling watch from go to whoa.|Fresh
The only saving graces are the (admittedly excellent) cinematography and production values -- the action scenes are crisp, smooth and packed with tension -- but they feel almost irrelevant when the content they have to work with is this bad.|Rotten
The violence has speed, impact and follow-through -- it's a magnificent rebuke to all the hundreds of cute killings on screen in summer movies.|Fresh
Mackenzie goes western in satisfying style, while Bridges, Pine and Foster bring true grit to Sheridan's tight script.|Fresh
We will never get another Howard Hawks or Raoul Walsh, but, every now and then, we see a film that pays homage to their spirit.|Fresh
Is there any better background for this sort of tale than a succession of wide open landscapes, dusty streets, and cheap diners?|Fresh

... a contemporary Western that doesn't fall victim to genre pitfalls. In other words, there's more depth and complexity here than a simple manhunt leading to a climactic showdown. Yet it still dishes out some old-fashioned frontier justice.|Fresh
It's a simple equation, but the details make it sing.|Fresh
Hell or High Water has several positive elements, including a great cast and a thrilling finish, but thanks to lax pacing and a narrative that wanders a bit too much, we end up with a film that never truly comes together into a satisfying whole.|Rotten
A modern-day set crime western that delves into the themes of right, wrong, law and capitalism with a righteous heart that pulsates within the grey of a morality tale where the pursuit of money turns good men bad.|Fresh
Bridges, as always, is a joy to experience, digging into his role with unbridled gusto.|Fresh

Bridges is on fine form and Pine and Foster are a combustible duo. Mackenzie doesn't put a horse-shoed foot wrong.|Fresh

Hell or High Water is a contemporary western with pick-up trucks instead of horses. But some things never change.|Fresh

If this isn't the best film of the year, then it won't be missing that exalted mark by much.|Fresh
Hell or High Water isn't the kind of flashy film that arrived with a lot of fanfare and it certainly isn't your average heist movie, it sneaks up on you and will surprise you with its grace and depth.|Fresh
Mackenzie gives every one of his actors the opportunity to show what stuff they are made of. And they deliver, each in their own way.|Fresh
There are no real villains, just two brothers who have a code and the rangers who live by another. In the inevitable final clash, as in all good Westerns, it becomes apparent they have a lot more in common than they think.|Fresh
...a desperate, bleak and horribly authentic look at post-GFC America.|Fresh
Distinguished by a wonderfully nuanced, varied and haunting score thanks to Australian musos Nick Cave and Warren Ellis ...is a fascinating hybrid of melancholy morality play, modern Western and arthouse drama|Fresh
In the perfect marriage of plot, character, setting and music, Hell or High Water is a crackling good thriller, compounded by the contrast of thrilling action|Fresh
Hell or High Water is both an exhilarating crime thriller and a black comedy that shares unexpected thematic parallels with Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show and also No Country For Old Men.|Fresh
One of the year's most pleasant surprises.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is about the fight or flight instincts at the epicentre of the disintegration of American society. Mackenzie and Sheridan and their players dance with that relative morality gracefully.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is a smartly-written (by Taylor Sheridan of Sicario) well-acted film that closely observes its characters and their relationships, even minor characters, which are often glossed over in lesser films.|Fresh
Worrying his lines like a plug of chaw, Jeff Bridges again proves that an extreme, even expressionistic characterization can be an unlikely vehicle for emotional honesty.|Fresh
Destined to become a modern classic - and deservedly so.|Fresh
Instant Texas with all the trimmings. Highly recommended.|Fresh
Pine and Foster put in career bests as brothers, who are different but unerringly loyal to each other, and to their values.|Fresh
I can't think of another film in recent memory that has had so much respect for every one of its characters.|Fresh
The whole movie offers ample evidence that [Mackenzie] has stealthily achieved an unassuming but utterly genuine mastery of his craft.|Fresh
... a forlorn modern-day Western ... Its garrulous style and tumbleweed authenticity will stay in mind long after the plot has faded from memory ... Bridges is essentially doing Tommy Lee Jones|Fresh
Every scene bristles with comedy and suspense, and the atmosphere is further enhanced by a moody score and wonderfully evocative songs by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.|Fresh
Anchored by excellent performances by Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges, Hell of High Water manages to successfully marry the western and heist genres. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Alongside plenty of heist-movie humor and suspense is a bleak fatalism grounded in depressing reality and resignation to the miserable necessity it demands.|Fresh
It's quite a film.|Fresh
Always an actor of huge vitality, Foster gives a career best while Pine shows he's far more than just a pretty face. The landscape belongs to Bridges, however.|Fresh
Though this is a thriller with a conscience, it doesn't fall back on black-and-white morality to get us on the side of its outlaw protagonists.|Fresh
art heist, part western for the Occupy generation, this sharply plotted thriller is a triumph for both director David Mackenzie and writer Taylor Sheridan.|Fresh
A contemporary Western, [which] like the best of them, is concerned with the moral character of the frontier, and whether the lawless and the righteous have a foot in each other's territory.|Fresh
A hybrid of crime drama and neo-western..., Hell or High Water uses its half-breed genre thrills to expose an American dream long since soured by recession, and running on empty|Fresh
There's no Bonnie and Clyde-style glamour but the film has an emotional depth that you don't often find in a heist thriller.|Fresh
The deft sketches of minor characters - each surviving tough times in their own way - give human faces to the film's messaging.|Fresh
The plot functions with lean efficiency... but the real purpose of screenwriter Taylor Sheridan and director David Mackenzie is to evoke an American south-west that time forgot.|Fresh
It really would be a crime if Hell or High Water didn't get some recognition come awards time. It'll definitely leave its dust in your bones, and something in your eye.|Fresh
A smartly crafted heist thriller that quietly peels back the layers from its macho male characters to reveal the pain and tenderness inside.|Fresh
As with Starred Up, Mackenzie's family-centric prison drama, Hell or High Water is full of grim nooks and crannies.|Fresh
One of the best pictures I have seen all year.|Fresh
A gripping cops-and-robbers thriller with a strong sense of place, and a timely thematic undercurrent that packs a powerful emotional punch.|Fresh
Elevated by a richly detailed script from Sicario writer Taylor Sheridan, who pens roughly authentic dialogue and fleshes out even the most peripheral characters to give the story a genuine heft.|Fresh
It's a familiar story but one very well told, skewed by dry detail and snappy dialogue, scoring three top-notch performances with a great dustbowl soundtrack by Warren Ellis and Nick Cave.|Fresh
There are plenty of great Westerns and there are arguably even more heist movies... but here, director David Mackenzie seamlessly infuses the two, interpreting the best traditions from each in his own way.|Fresh
What you don't expect is how deeply it cuts and how much you care about the characters and the people caught in the crossfire of their impossible dreams.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is one of the year's best pictures, sort of a twist on a modern-day Western with plenty of West Texas flavoring and a hint of Oklahoma spice.|Fresh
For Mackenzie, a British filmmaker whose career to date has been nomadic, the movie feels like finally finding the right key for a lock.|Fresh
Unexpected directions, sharp humour and powerful performances.|Fresh
The best movie of the summer season.|Fresh
Taut, tense and burnished by Jeff Bridges at his best. This is a deceptively simple tale of Texan cops and robbers that drags the Old West into the modern age.|Fresh
Mackenzie's tenth feature cultivates great compassion for its characters, while making wider points relating to exploitation and community erosion well.|Fresh
One of the finest American crime films in quite some time.|Fresh
Pitched as a heist movie, David Mackenzie's latest film feels more like a contemporary Western set in a time of heightened financial anxiety.|Fresh
The violence hurts because the film has texture and meaning and the characters matter.|Fresh
Nothing that Chris Pine has done to date prepared me for how good he is here.|Fresh
While there's some good action while the brothers are holding up the banks, this film is mostly conversation between Pine and Foster, on the one hand, and Bridges and Birmingham, on the other. Compelling is not the word for which I would be groping.|Rotten
A brilliantly conceived hard-hitting modern Western.|Fresh
"""Pass With Care,"" reads a road sign, perforated with bullet holes. That's Texas; that's America."|Fresh
The movie plays with clichs only to upend them.|Fresh
Hollywood used to turn out solidly constructed, midsized genre films like this by the score, but now they're so rare that Hell or High Water practically seems like a unicorn.|Fresh
Mackenzie has infused Hell or High Water with a gritty and irresistibly stylish feel that's heightened by a roster of superb performances...|Fresh
David Mackenzie's Hell or High Water further challenges Hollywood's unethical trends. It twists the outlawry of two white Texas brothers...into a study of millennial cynicism.|Fresh
In crossing potboiler and art film streams, David Mackenzie and Taylor Sheridan have come up with something distinct, if not groundbreaking.|Fresh
Fantastic. It's planted in various durable genres, as well as American myth itself, while it's also very much of the moment. (Splice Today)|Fresh
Hell or High Water is an elegy for the disenfranchised.|Fresh
All three leads do strong work with characters and a story that never quite approach their level, and together they make the film entertaining and engrossing despite itself.|Fresh
Takes a relatively simple cops-and-robbers theme, drops it deep in the heart of Texas and doesn't skimp on complex characters or moral dilemmas.|Fresh
'Hell or High Water' bristles with true grit.|Fresh
The gloom and impending doom are leavened by darkly humorous dialogue and moments of odd levity.|Fresh
A top-notch thriller that's also evocative, suspenseful, and increasingly captivating. A must-watch.|Fresh
Hell or High Water makes for a contemplative dramatic thriller that is fueled by great performances and strong direction.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is something rare. It's a film for adults and by that I mean it's smart, it has something to say, and it doesn't condescend to the audience.|Fresh
Mackenzie happens to be Scottish, but he's made the best American Western in years.|Fresh
For all the genre formula -- the robbing, the hideout, the chase, the ambush -- the film is less about thrills than about slow-burning tension, and it stands out with its cultural and socio-economic specificity.|Fresh
Every element of the movie feels at once lived-in and alive. Don't miss it.|Fresh
This free-wheeling crime drama is packed to the gills with atmosphere, color and performances to the point the movie itself speaks with a gritty drawl.|Fresh
One of the year's best. See this one come hell or high water.|Fresh
Scenic, well-paced and rich in dialogue and character, the film is Coen brothers for the squares, and maybe the best middle-of-the-seat drama of the summer.|Fresh
The cast is uniformly magnificent, but it's Pine who steals the movie.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is at once a tale of desperation in hard times, and a keenly observed character study - or studies.|Fresh
The Old West meets the modern West in Hell or High Water, a soulful crime drama about desperate brothers pitted against the system -- and one cagey lawman.|Fresh
[Hell or High Water] rides superb writing, Oscar-caliber performances and a serious social message to such grandeur as to make it one of the best pictures of 2016.|Fresh
A film with the sort of sweeping grandeur that today's filmmakers rarely aspire to, let alone fulfill.|Fresh
[A] near-perfect film.|Fresh
By the time we reach the climax of this smoking modern western, the conclusion seems both tense and inevitable.|Fresh
It lets us make our own judgments about what its flawed characters do, and that makes this low-budget genre exercise one of the best things I've seen this year.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" is about two brothers on a crime spree. But David Mackenzie's film has a lot more on its mind than mere suspense and thrills."|Fresh
"Much more than a genre piece, ""Hell or High Water"" takes you places that you thought the big screen had forgotten."|Fresh
What the film lacks in flash it makes up for in cinematography. What could have been a very plain-looking film with its flat, dusty lands is beautifully captured with wide shots and a breathtaking yellow and blue color palette.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is set up like a cops and robbers drama, but it plays out like a complicated western -- no black-hats-and-white-hats simplicity here. It's all moral shades of grey.|Fresh
Hell or High Water takes a story that's been told many times before and makes it feel vital.|Fresh
If Star Trek movies have unfortunately convinced you that Pine is no better than a good-looking plank of plywood from Home Depot, you owe it to yourself (and Pine) to see Hell or High Water.|Fresh
If Blood Simple and Fargo were forced to mate, the offspring would turn out a lot like this.|Fresh
Puts the line between right and wrong underneath a scorching, unforgiving Texas sun then stretches it out on a lonesome, steaming highway, toward a blurred horizon, with no clear end in sight.|Fresh
The plot is clever, and its intricacies are beautifully worked out.|Fresh
One of the most enjoyable and satisfying moviegoing experiences of the year.|Fresh
The real joy of the film is in watching Bridges and Birmingham play out their affectionate working dynamic like two characters in an Elmore Leonard novel.|Fresh
The unhurried approach both ratchets up the tension and allows more time to get to know the players, who often talk around what they want to say in barbed, witty, Elmore Leonard-inspired dialogue.|Fresh
A crackling example of the New Western, mixing familiar archetypes into an entertaining genre exercise.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" is a story about men, but the movie is really about a mindset, a way of life, the strength and resolution required to make a living in a world that doesn't care about you."|Fresh
Old-school bank robbery meets the new economy-and the New West-in Hell or High Water, a lean tale of cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, and customers and bankers.|Fresh
'Hell or High Water' has a satisfying, old Western feel to it. The tense finale adds an interesting flourish that leaves you wanting more.|Fresh
Give me a well-made little genre exercise like this over a bloated franchise flick any day of the week. This one's got something on its mind to boot, which makes it one of the few must-see movies of the season.|Fresh
... a movie with Lone Star swagger matching its dusty characters, scripted by Taylor Sheridan with the arcing tension he took south of the border in last year's thrilling Sicario.|Fresh
It's a portrait of economic desperation rooted in a specific place and a specific time that also happens to be a thrilling heist film.|Fresh
Robbing of banks may be very 1800s, but robbing by banks is very 2010s/post-Occupy. Ergo, robbing robber banks makes for a post-Occupy Western. Pine, Foster, and Bridges kill it.|Fresh
Engaging from the first second onward, Mackenzie has created yet another stunner.|Fresh
The action is as schematic and artificial as a chess game, and the characters have as much identity as its pieces.|Rotten
A neo-noir masterpiece not to be missed!|Fresh
Great drama, cast and cinematography|Fresh
Pulpy, old-fashioned Western action and terrific performances make Hell or High Water one of the most satisfying releases of the summer.|Fresh
"Pine, best known as Capt. Kirk in the blockbuster ""Star Trek"" franchise, is the movie's big surprise."|Fresh
Hell or High Water is a genre film that transcends genre, an iconic American tale that is nonetheless firmly grounded in both place and time. One of the best movies of the year.|Fresh
Stillness can be peaceful, but it can also be menacing.|Fresh
You've seen it all before -- but hell, it's worth seeing again.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" is one of the most original, entertaining and intriguing films of 2016."|Fresh
David Mackenzie's terrifically tense Western Hell or High Water is set in the present, but it keeps emphasizing that in some key ways, life hasn't changed in West Texas since pioneer days.|Fresh
When the final showdown arrives, the men are redefined by their deeds and what began as a sharp genre piece deepens into a subtle character study.|Fresh
As far as I'm concerned, Mackenzie and Sheridan's film is pretty much flawless, delivering on just about every level.|Fresh
Is always better when Bridges is on the screen... but Foster and Pine certainly hold up their end of the bargain with performances to be considered among their very best.|Fresh
Moment to moment, frame for frame, David Mackenzie's Hell Or High Water is the best American movie released so far this year.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" is a great genre picture: film noir cannily combined with a Western, but with a modern-day setting."|Fresh
Can we edit out all the extraneous lecturing and make Hell or High Water a four star movie? Please?|Fresh
One of the best American films of the year. Bridges is Oscar bait, again.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is a simple but perceptive, morally ambiguous, and detailed piece of storytelling.|Fresh
"Wow. Not since ""No Country for Old Men"" has a modern Western been so thematically rich."|Fresh
It's frustrating that Hell or High Water contains so many good things that just don't coalesce into a fully satisfying moviegoing experience.|Rotten

Hell or High Water is one of the best films released thus far this year. The action unfolds efficiently, alternating deftly between tense action and genuine hilarity.|Fresh
My number one film of the year. Yes, it's that good. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
A wonderful modern Texas Western, full of terrific performances by Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster and Gil Birmingham.|Fresh
It allows Jeff Bridges to deliver what may be one of the most colorful, and yet nuanced, performances of his career.|Fresh
Although you can pretty much guess how things are going to play out in the finale, the ride is so satisfying, bleakly funny and well-acted, you almost wish the cat-and-mouse games would never end.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" is very, very good."|Fresh
A gripping story that touches on the most profound American struggles - from guns to real estate, race, and income inequality - specific in detail but universal in scope.|Fresh
"If there's such a thing as an easygoing thriller, then ""Hell or High Water"" is it. The stakes may be steep, but the characters can seem more nonchalant than nervous."|Fresh
British director David Mackenzie knows how to deliver a rip-roaring crime thriller, and he has an ear for West Texas idioms, too.|Fresh
Despite the weighty issues at play, there's much about the movie to simply enjoy -- the camaraderie of the brothers and the lawmen, and the not infrequent elements of humor.|Fresh
Feels old-fashioned in its action-thriller gratification and in-the-moment about everything else.|Fresh
A great American film that is not only an exciting cat and mouse bank robber thriller but also a movie with much relevance for these times.|Fresh
Standout acting elevates what could have been a clumsy script from writer Taylor Sheridan (the former Sons of Anarchy star).|Fresh
The 101 minutes that follow essentially comprise a feature-length Nebraska-era Bruce Springsteen song, their brilliance lying in the details.|Fresh
Hot damn, this one's a goodie - a mesmerizing, modern-day western that moves with the coiled intensity of a rattlesnake ready to spring.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is more than just another movie about cops and robbers.|Fresh
It's simply one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
There's a real sense of desperation embedded in the core of the picture.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" overcomes its vapid political leanings with loads of West Texas atmosphere, smart dialogue and acutely observed relationships."|Fresh
A sterling example of genre craftsmanship at its intelligent and unexpectedly affecting best.|Fresh
You could freeze nearly any frame of Hell or High Water and you'd be looking at a work of art. It's stark and breathtaking and gorgeous to behold.|Fresh
Misgivings, maybe, but the go-for-broke performances by Bridges, Foster, and Pine are just so damned enjoyable that little impedes the fun while the movie is unfolding.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" may be the best picture released so far in 2016."|Fresh
We don't live in an era of white hats and black hats. Maybe we never did. Today, everyone is gray - or, in Mackenzie's color scheme, faded blue and sad beige|Fresh
"In a word, ""Hell or High Water"" is terrific."|Fresh
The tension and anger in this neo-Western practically radiate off the screen.|Fresh
The believable bond between Pine and Foster adds one more meaningful stitch of personal history to a script that perfectly combines the Old West with the Nu.|Fresh
Audiences have been down this dusty backroad before. The thrill of High Of High Water is in its skillful, offbeat execution.|Fresh
You might have to go back to 1967's Bonnie and Clyde to find a film about bank robbers that feels as of its time as David Mackenzie's Hell or High Water.|Fresh
Hell or High Water is a rare humanist Western: Finality is the true villain.|Fresh
A suspenseful and purposeful thriller that uses the iconography of classic Westerns to tell a modern story.|Fresh
A manhunt movie that blends action, comedy, drama and even a smidgen of social commentary into an almost perfect package, offering excitement, laughs and a dollop of poignancy to go along with them.|Fresh
Texas is as much a riveting character in [this] fascinating crime drama as the brothers turned bank robbers at its heart or the laconic lawman who coolly follows them across the sun-hardened landscape like a hunter on the trail of his next kill.|Fresh
They don't make them like this anymore - but they still can, and here's the proof.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" has one foot in pulp conventions, and the other in some stimulating, morally tricky contemporary answers to those conventions. What the movie has, above all, is a dramatic line, clean and straight."|Fresh
In this bleak West Texas landscape where everyone seems to be struggling, you find yourself rooting, inexplicably, for all of them against a clear villain: the faceless, predatory bank.|Fresh
It pulls the viewer in multiple directions, but it never unravels, delivering a true thrill ride that feels emotionally authentic and remains decidedly cinematic.|Fresh
"""Hell or High Water"" is a gripping heist drama keenly attuned to the outsider politics of our times."|Fresh
"The rare crime movie with room for both commentary on the housing crisis and ""That's what she said"" jokes."|Fresh
A thrilling, tense, and weirdly funny heist film anchored by a tight, no-nonsense script.|Fresh
Director David Mackenzie tells a sad story about desperate characters that is somehow as thrilling as it is heartbreaking.|Fresh
Not everything is what it seems in this deceptively simple story.|Fresh
"Let's make it easy: If you like sitting in a dark room looking at pictures that move, you should see ""Hell or High Water."" It's terrific."|Fresh
A heist picture that plays like a Waylon Jennings song -- lonesome, ornery and mean.|Fresh
A dusty, blood-soaked myth of crime and punishment far from fantasy, a finger planted on the pulse -- and the trigger.|Fresh
Hell or High Water delivers both action and character that should satisfy viewers looking for an alternative to high-octane Hollywood blockbusters.|Fresh
Hell or High Water's deliberate pacing gives it the feel of a heist story with its feet stuck in mud - and that's a good thing.|Fresh
As with Sicario, the broad strokes of the film's Southwestern stereotypes gradually sharpen into focus as the story pivots to a look at the systemic forces that shape the characters.|Fresh
It's got a dry dusty power, and a dark sense of humor. And when it finally saddles up and really rides, pardner, you'd best get out of its way.|Fresh
"[CANNES 2016] ""Hell or High Water"" is a real gem - a high point Cannes 2016. Look for this entertaining drama to attract a following in the States and beyond."|Fresh
