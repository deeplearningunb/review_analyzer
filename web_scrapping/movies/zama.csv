As befits a film about waiting for answers, this is a languid and enervating watch, and feverishly funny. By halfway I was desperate for something to happen and I was then somewhat over-rewarded in this regard.|Fresh
If cinema is about being transported to another place, Martel is unrivaled as a guide...|Fresh
In a sunbaked seaside town in 18th century Argentina, an official of the Spanish crown finds himself in an absurd scenario as he waits in vain for a long-promised transfer.|Fresh
Zama offers us the freedom that its titular character so desperately seeks in people, places, and things.|Fresh
Zama is an experience equal parts intoxicating and disorienting.|Fresh
A richly textured and delicately spun portrait of a man on the precipice of sanity.|Fresh
Martel is at it again with a quite exquisite, deadpan half-dream about the squalid goings-on in a remote South American colonial outpost at the end of the 18th century.|Fresh
An elaborate piece of cinema suffused with so many details, both visual and audible, that it's impossible to absorb everything happening behind-the-scenes. The vivid portrait of colonialism marks a magnificent return for Martel after a nine-year absence.|Fresh
Told in the typically oblique style of Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel, this adaptation of Antonio di Benedetto's novel is nonetheless a pointed fable about the futility of colonialism.|Fresh
You have to find your own way through Zama, slowed down by the tropical torpor that hangs over the whole film. The pace is languid, the style is cryptic and the mood is downbeat, to say the least.|Fresh

Lead actor Daniel Gim√©nez Cacho's turn shows great empathy for the title character... [his] eyes are soulful and melancholy, often staring in the distance or at the ground.|Fresh
The film is a wonderfully mystical, elliptical satire on the failed pretensions of colonialism with none so blind as the colonialists themselves who can't see that they are the fish in the metaphor.|Fresh
If Zama is an exercise in playing witness to hopelessness and restlessness, it results in anything but, and is further evidence of Martel's visionary talents.|Fresh
ama is a unique, mischievous and gorgeously clever piece of work, almost worth the nine-year wait between director Lucrecia Martel's last film - The Headless Woman - and this.|Fresh
Just know that you are entering no man's land the moment you set foot in the theater.|Fresh
Strand Releasing gives Zama a lovely Blu-ray transfer, though viewers hoping for any contextual supplements about either the film's complex politics or adaptation from novel to film will be left wanting.|Fresh
This gently surreal, impossibly lush existential nightmare is almost punishingly languorous, but the rewards are many for those who vibe with its peculiar rhythms.|Fresh
Zama is elliptical, violent, and lush, like the other two, with the same mournful, deadpan approach to dismantling the pretensions and fantasies of its European protagonists.|Fresh
...the tale of a man haunted by his place in history.|Fresh
Nine years since making her last feature, Argentinian filmmaker Lucrecia Martel returns with an effort that matches her reputation: mythic.|Fresh
An absurdist folly pitched somewhere between Joseph Conrad and Samuel Beckett.|Fresh
Martel masterfully creates a vivid, sensuous, and unbearable world from which Zama and the audience can't wait to escape. Yet we also can't seem to take our eyes off it.|Fresh
Textured, slow-burning and hypnotic, the most resolutely arthouse release since Hard to Be a God unfolds as a fever dream.|Fresh
This is the sort of comedy that's not exactly funny. Its points are too angry - and dispassionately argued - to be a laugh riot.|Fresh
It's a thrillingly layered film, and is perhaps best experienced by surrendering to its intoxicating strangeness.|Fresh
The merging of raw nature and well-researched colonial history with magic realism tinged by Kafka, Camus, and Borges is fascinating throughout.|Fresh
The film might be a touch pretentious, but it is exhilarating in its rich textures and heady strangeness.|Fresh
Argentinian auteur Lucrecia Martel is in spellbinding form in her first film in eight years.|Fresh
A beguiling cinematic journey through identity formation in Latin America.|Fresh
What's most compelling...is the way Martel skewers the history of colonialism without voyeuristically indulging in the moment of conquest.|Fresh
Martel has made a woozy epic about the toxicity of torpor.|Fresh
Almost too well, and certainly too well to let us sit back comfortably, Martel has nailed colonialism as a living death.|Fresh
It's impeccably done...|Fresh
Zama is a story that obviously has something of Beckett and Kafka, but creates worryingly plausible real-world evocations of their cosmic loneliness and bureaucratic imprisonment.|Fresh
In adapting Antonio di Benedetto's 1956 novel for the screen, writer-director [Lucrecia] Martel offers a very different perspective on the colonial experience.|Fresh
The film puts us in a trance, too: one of bewildered, bottomless wonder.|Fresh
Hard to suppress the hyperbole with this one. Truly an awesome achievement.|Fresh
There are times when Zama seems indecipherable and impenetrable, but for the most part, the sound design and images of expeditions and battles are so intoxicating that it's a wonder to behold.|Fresh
Just when you think it cannot get worse, you meet Zama.|Fresh
I wouldn't be surprised to see Zama canonized as one of the more remarkable artistic achievements of this decade. It's certainly a standout of 2018.|Fresh
No matter what you make of this strangely enthralling movie, Zama will take you on a trip in which Martel serves as a remorseless, insightful guide.|Fresh
It's already one of 2018's best and most haunting films, and a lashing indictment of colonialist hubris.|Fresh
Zama is unquestionably a Martel film... it's clear that we're in the hands of a master once more.|Fresh
Gorgeous, sneakily funny, and amazing to hear, with its soundtrack of buzzing insects and screeching birds.|Fresh
Lisandro Alonso's Jauja remains the high-water mark of this burgeoning genre, but Martel's Zama is a worthy if not wholly satisfying addition.|Fresh
It's a hypnotic story, and a wry commentary on civilization, which has changed less in the last 200-odd years than we might want to believe. I'd argue that the clothes and music are better today, mind you.|Fresh
An elegantly lensed and slowly percolating satire of 18th-century colonial misadventures, adapted from a 1956 novel by Antonio Di Benedetto.|Fresh
The material comes from a celebrated 1956 novel of the same name by Antonio di Benedetto, but Martel's close-ups of her red-faced leading man -- scored to a plummeting synth straight out of Scarface -- edge the film into comic territory.|Fresh
Martel's confounding and brilliant fourth feature reaffirms her status as an essential art-house filmmaker of the new millennium.|Fresh
The film is perfectly orchestrated to give off a languid, restless energy that matches the protagonist's own maddening inertia.|Fresh
It's a tour de force, and Zama is the rare movie good enough to deserve it.|Fresh
This redirection of attention from individual acts of violence toward the structural violence of colonialism itself isn't a departure but an acute reading of the novel.|Fresh
Martel's films can seem disjointed, yet there is always the palpable, inexorable feeling of malaise, of psychic and moral rot under exacting investigation.|Fresh
It wants little more than to reach out in all directions, to peer into the void, knowing deep down that the void can't be bothered to peer back.|Fresh
A smart film, historically-minded, literary in the most cinematic possible way.|Fresh
Fascinating, beautifully shot and acted, and packed with witty satire.|Fresh
The overall, super-charged ambience that surges though the pages of the book is what Martel catches to perfection in her dazzling weave of images and sounds, musical selections from different periods, gestures and colors.|Fresh
Poetic is a word that gets thrown around willy-nilly, but it fits perfectly here. So does woozy. It feels less like a film than a high fever.|Fresh
A mordantly funny and relentlessly modernist critique of colonialism.|Fresh
"""Zama"" is a patient, delicately strange film chronicling an increasingly impatient man and a destiny beyond his control."|Fresh
Zama is a complex and sometimes deliberately disconcerting film.|Fresh
A tense literary adventure that Martel turns into a hypnotic immersion. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Mr. Gim√©nez Cacho, who appears in nearly every scene, anchors ""Zama"" beautifully in an expressive yet reserved performance that pulls you in intellectually rather than emotionally."|Fresh
Even as Martel steeps the film deep within Zama's perspective, she observes his tortuous male pathos with the critical distance of a female gaze.|Fresh
Lucrecia Martel remains one of cinema's best visual stylists.|Fresh
Martel creates a cinema of dialectical tensions; the bustling activity of offices and drawing rooms veers outside the frame while voices of authority and complaint assail the hero with a bewildering tangle of conflicting demands and desires.|Fresh
The result is a dense, difficult but deeply rewarding film.|Fresh
The film's pleasures are that it's filled with very funny bizarre scenes.|Fresh
Cleverly drawing on her protagonist's predicament, Martel offers a scathing satire of colonialism as she documents the mental deterioration of a man left hanging, existing on a diet of promises, promises, promises.|Fresh
...a complex story, allegedly subtle. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
... the Argentinian director presents the life of Don Diego as a oneness in which time stretches and shrinks at will. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In the land of [director] Lucretia Martel's sun, the only thing that can be done, if at all, is to wait for Godot. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As it turns out intriguing images, amazing sound design, and formal control are not enough. Especially if your movie is plotty.|Rotten
"In a historical sense, ""Zama"" is an unfortunate testimony about the vassal at the service of a crown. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
The film is an impressionistic landscape of sounds, images and sharp dialogues -recognized from the original novel- that manage to leave the impression that we are not watching a film, but reading it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
... Zama casts an amorphous impression not unlike a nightmare or memory.|Fresh
It is an invitation to the senses, a film that floods, overflows... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Reinvents the historical epic by bringing to life an absurdist look at an unnamed, isolated late 18th Century Spanish colony in South America.|Fresh
I might call the film a delirium, but Martel is too precise for that, and too harshly satirical. You might rather think of this work as a landscape film, whose softly colored, picturesque surface is disturbed here and there by grubby fools.|Fresh
Zama could be a mortal labyrinth that portrays the low and the mundane of Spanish colonies in South America. But no. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Zama is another winner in an immaculately crafted career, and will surely be seen as one of Martel's grandest achievements.|Fresh
Not many movies really get under your skin like Lucrecia Martel's masterful epic.|Fresh
How strange and apt that the year's most sensorially and ideologically dense film is also a comedy of microaggressions, built on the minor workplace humiliations of a pencil-pusher in the 1790s.|Fresh
Zama takes on a strange and overpowering sense of liberation.|Fresh
Out of the hypnotic rhythm of the film regularly bursts the harsh violence of colonialism.|Fresh
Not content to merely dramatize Di Benedetto's existential themes, she immerses the audience in them, with slow-paced scenes full of repetitive bureaucratic ennui, casual violence, a supporting cast of slaves and Indigenous characters..|Fresh
Zama, despite its setting, isn't such a radical departure for Martel; it preserves her talent for tracking an individual through chaotic social spheres ...|Fresh
A brilliant film that Martel makes 100% hers from a difficult novel like the Antonio Di Benedetto. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Zama"" is a difficult film. But if you find a way to crack open its forbidding, austere exterior, there is treasure to be found, or at least something that sparkles, beautiful and cruel, like the spiky insides of a geode."|Fresh
"Zama isn't a young buck looking for adventure and then got it. He's just a man who wants to get home and the comedy of errors-and his own hubris and lust-keeps him there and ultimately takes him to ""the horror, the horror."""|Fresh
You might stumble upon brilliant insights amidst the confusion. The big picture, however, proves elusive.|Rotten
It's confusing and heavy and bears down hard until a third-act swerve throws in colours and movement and spins the viewer out of the theatre in wonder. It won't be forgotten.|Fresh
The frustrating nine-year wait for new material from Martel has done nothing to blunt her exquisite, inventive command of sound and image, nor her knack for subtly violent exposure of social and racial prejudice on the upper rungs of the class ladder.|Fresh
A picture that's antic, sensual and strange, with a top-note of menace and a malarial air.|Fresh
