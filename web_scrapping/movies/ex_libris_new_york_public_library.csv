Hypnotic and illuminating.|Fresh

It does give you a regained respect for a great institution that is integral to our society.|Fresh
...classic Wiseman, presenting multiple facets of his subject, segueing from one to the next with street signs, establishing shots and empty interior spaces.|Fresh
There are a lot of great scenes in Ex Libris. And yet it is so punishingly long, by the time it is over, it's hard to feel anything but relieved.|Rotten
A powerful blueprint for saving public libraries from predatory urban removal developers, intent on demolishing and grabbing the land right under them - and in effect community centers for the masses by default, in a society lacking them under capitalism.|Fresh
Maybe one temple of learning will inspire a visit to another: see the movie, then pop into your local biblioteca.|Fresh
The democracy of his filmmaking is, as ever, striking; this is one of our most American artists, and 'Ex Libris' is the very definition of what he does well.|Fresh
"""Ex Libris: The New York Public Library"" is more than a magisterial mash note to that distinguished establishment, it's a heartening examination of the vastness of human knowledge and the multiple ways we the people endeavor to access it."|Fresh

[An] endearing shaggy dog of a documentary.|Fresh
Who knew a documentary about the library could turn out to be the most thrilling political film of the year?|Fresh
The huge canvas becomes an inadvertent self-portrait of this most self-effacing of auteurs, whom one senses entirely shares the NYPL's noble aims and belief in the power of education, community and hard work.|Fresh
This institutional study morphs into a story about people. You, in the audience, become one of them. And you walk away all the better for it.|Fresh

Meticulous and mostly absorbing ...|Fresh
