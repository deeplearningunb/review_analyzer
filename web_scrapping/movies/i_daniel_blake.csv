"When I first saw British director's ""I, Daniel Blake""... I found its tale of an unemployed man's struggle extremely moving but a bit heavy-handed. After the election, that excess now seems like righteous, well-placed anger."|Fresh
One can sympathise with Loach's political sensibilities, but this film's shallowness, twee sensibility and transparent polemics make for an unchallenging viewing experience.|Rotten
Ken Loach gives you just enough in the 100 minutes running time and this film will captivate and disgust the viewer in equal measure.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is about the struggles of an ailing common man against the labyrinthine welfare bureaucracy to get that elusive 'employment and support allowance.'|Fresh

For a taste of real populism, you could do a lot worse than check out the latest film from veteran British director Ken Loach: I, Daniel Blake.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is the plea of a good man before an indifferent society, not so different from that made by Arthur Miller in Death of a Salesman. Before, as now: attention must be paid. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The title I, Daniel Blake is an act of self-naming, a declaration of personhood in the face of a system that fails to treat people with dignity.|Fresh
With this film, the director continues to show a strength, a vitality and a coherence that not many young colleagues can show. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

I, Daniel Blake, is a film imbued with dignity, grace and great sadness -- as well as a bit of humor and a lot of anger.|Fresh
One of the best pictures of the year...for about an hour.|Fresh
"Most political in its insistence that the smallest ""I"" matters, but as at his best, like his 1990s work... Loach's film is about empathy, a portrait of ordinary people, blunt, bracing yet loving and far, far from mere polemic."|Fresh
It's been a year since I, Daniel Blake won the prestigious Palme d'Or, and the neo-realist critique of the U.K.'s public-assistance bureaucracy is no less urgent today.|Fresh
It's a film about the unsustainable condition of being poor and alive, which admittedly sounds like a grueling experience. But I, Daniel Blake seeks understanding -- it seeks to connect -- and understanding is innately hopeful.|Fresh
Loach's half-century long efforts in his many films about the working class haven't always succeeded, but he's always tried. For the most part, this time he's succeeded beautifully.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is stark, plainspoken and predictable. Maybe a movie that makes the case for treating society's most vulnerable people with respect should be.|Fresh
Loach has created a modest but moving film that triumphs as a social drama, a friendship tale, and a trip through the world of job centers and food banks.|Fresh
...a socially relevant and poignant character study about the losing battle of an average guy against a system that sure does seem to not care.|Fresh
For the iconoclastic film director Ken Loach and his longtime screenwriting collaborator Paul Laverty, I, Daniel Blake represents their most accessible film ever.|Fresh

It will touch all but the most hard-hearted; in fact, I dare you to remain unmoved by its emotional finale.|Fresh
A film of empathy, grace and wit that goes a long way to explaining the populist anger so emblematic of these times.|Fresh
Often funny and sweet, it's a nonetheless damning indictment of the Tory government's punitive, belt-tightening austerity measures and a rallying cry for its victims, told in a fiercely unapologetic way.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is passionate filmmaking to its very core, as well as the rare art house effort that could stand a chance with mainstream audiences.|Fresh
Told bluntly but with the utmost in dignity and empathy, this is a film that has the power to change minds and shift preconceived perceptions.|Fresh
An emotionally powerful dissection of a nightmarish system tips into unnecessary polemic, falling short of the state of a nation piece it could have been.|Fresh
Loach's downtrodden heroes usually find some way to sustain hope, in family or in humor, in individual ingenuity or collective kindness. But this time, the filmmaker's own anger at systemic, interminable inequities threatens to overcome his optimism.|Fresh
There's a heightened edge to I, Daniel Blake, an embittered streak of comedy that keeps the otherwise miserable plot from weighing too heavily.|Fresh
Frank, unsentimental but fuelled by good nature and an earthy humour, the film reminds you of Loach's great works in the early '90s like Raining Stones and Ladybird, Ladybird.|Fresh
"In the end, the title, seemingly unremarkable, reveals itself as especially poignant. Daniel is crying out for recognition as an ""I"" -- even if he can't contribute, even if he needs help for a while."|Fresh

If you want reality -- if you want an idea, for one, as to how the British people could become so despairing that they would do something as drastic as vote to leave the European Union -- see I, Daniel Blake.|Fresh
Loach's film isn't as stridently political as it probably sounds. These are just proud people who want to be treated with respect.|Fresh
Grim drama about heartless welfare system; language.|Fresh
[In] trying to create his paean to the working man, Loach has stripped him of his three-dimensional humanity and replaced it with two-dimensional platitude.|Rotten
I, Daniel Blake undoubtedly has its heart in the right place; it's a shame that Loach and Laverty's good intentions haven't resulted, in the end, in better cinema.|Fresh
Loach's low-key naturalism, which barely masks his fury at the injustices perpetrated on screen, is matched by Dave Johns's performance as Daniel.|Fresh
A hectoring political op-ed about The State Of Britain Today, but when you've been hectored by Loach, you've been hectored by the very best.|Fresh
Equally heartwarming and heartbreaking. A testament to the humanism of writer/director Ken Loach|Fresh
While it lacks subtlety, the film captures the frustration of the working class, which is the filmmaker's hallmark, through a character that earns our sympathy and might also share our fury.|Fresh
Nobility and dignity for the ordinary person are values Loach has always championed, and they are at the very heart of I, Daniel Blake.|Fresh
Cinema has the power to open our eyes to the world's issues and offer a path forward if we're willing to take it. I, Daniel Blake is a great example and should not be missed.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is an important story, perfect for today's world, Loach once again proving that, even at 80 years of age, he's not done telling it as it is, and that's a wondrous thing indeed.|Fresh
Loach makes movies that are refreshingly honest in their approach and unflinching in their reaction to injustice.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is an extremely Ken Loach-y Ken Loach film, for better and for worse.|Fresh
"""I, Daniel Blake"" is a powerful return to form for Mr. Loach, the much-honored left-wing British filmmaker who is now 80 and is still in full command as a filmmaker and a social critic."|Fresh
The movie is filled with sympathetic solidarity for those like Daniel who work hard, treat everyone decently, receive small acts of personal kindness from decent ordinary people, and still get ground down by [the] system.|Fresh
Ken Loach's heartrending drama follows a widowed British carpenter struggling to keep an inhuman social services bureaucracy from turning him into just another number.|Fresh
Some nightmares play out in ornate and stylized fashion, while others are categorized by a slow drip of disasters and frustrations. I, Daniel Blake, the new movie from Ken Loach, locates itself squarely within the latter category.|Fresh
"[A] combination of traditional movie naturalism and still-seething anger is at the rabble-rousing heart of ""I, Daniel Blake,"" Loach's latest clear-eyed bulletin from the world of the dispossessed."|Fresh
"""I, Daniel Blake"" speaks to anyone who's ever had to deal with our horrible modern world, made up of equal parts Kafka and Orwell ..."|Fresh
Award-winning film that will draw out your empathy for those coping with poverty and the bureaucracy of England's welfare system.|Fresh
When the system is rigged, trying to do the right thing wears a man down.|Fresh
The ironic thing is that even when Ken Loach has made something that feels topical, it's really just Loach doing Loach. He's always done his thing, whether anyone, particularly anyone in power, was paying attention.|Fresh
In a world that seems to be getting worse with every passing minute, I, Daniel Blake is a sobering but inspiring pleasure - easily one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
It constantly hectors the viewer. But it never feels quite genuine.|Rotten
A scalding, perfectly wrought film about a man's struggle to assert his dignity in a bureaucratic system that's rigged to destroy it.|Fresh
Once I, Daniel Blake got underway I found it difficult to pretend that I didn't know exactly where it was headed, even as I choked back tears.|Rotten
A scathing indictment of how the government of an industrialized country treats working taxpayers who become disabled and must jump through hoops for a minimal income on the dole.|Fresh
A film with protagonists that strive to extract tender moments and comical relief from day to day. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Loach really rages against the machine here - emphatically, heroically, stoically - but the true heart of the film, the friendship between Daniel and Katie, is touching and sincere.|Fresh
There's also no avoiding the passion and fury that drives I, Daniel Blake, or its attempts at shining a light where it's needed most.|Fresh
Among the many attractions of the beguiling I, Daniel Blake is [Loach's] gift for gallows humour.|Fresh
People such as Dan and Katie are usually just statistics: by allowing us to get to know the reality, humanity and heartbreak behind these statistics, Loach has made one of his finest films.|Fresh
Dave Johns gives impeccable timing to his character's exasperation but real heart to the movie's emotional core|Fresh
A movie that you can not end without having any posture or idea about the subject. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Incredibly well researched, written, directed and performed, I, Daniel Blake refuses to be ignored and spoken down to.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is an important story, powerfully told. But Loach's message would have been even more affecting had he delivered it in a slightly less didactic manner.|Fresh
As he has always done, Loach simply sticks to carving off a slice of life as authentically as he possibly can, and then lets the remarkably realistic results speak for themselves.|Fresh
It is simple storytelling at its most powerful.|Fresh
This is a great film by an important lone voice.|Fresh
There's a sense of despondency about Ken Loach's latest film as it describes the plight of a decent man whose self-respect is throttled by bureaucracy.|Fresh
[It's] good politics but bad drama.|Rotten
A climactic emotional explosion momentarily turns Daniel into something of a working-class hero, although Loach could take up that mantle himself.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake isn't a film; it's a war cry for change.|Fresh
While it's a typically plain-looking Loach film, there's grim poetry in the script by Paul Laverty, his eighth for the director. You could write songs from some of the lines.|Fresh
The common person's masterpiece.|Fresh
Loach returned to cinema staying true to his style, appealing to his social humanism with this film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

The film's deftness of touch makes it extremely watchable and nowhere near as turgid as it sounds.|Fresh
If at times the plotting feels a little manufactured to make certain points, the humanity of the characters and their quiet suffering is moving and aided by outstanding performances; especially from Squires.|Fresh
"A gut-wrenching tragicomic drama (about ""a monumental farce"") that blends the timeless humanity of the Dardenne brothers' finest works with the contemporary urgency of Loach's own 1966 masterpiece Cathy Come Home."|Fresh
With I, Daniel Blake, his latest film and one of his finest, Loach's talent for humour runs through the entire work.|Fresh
At every turn, Loach's humanism -- his total commitment to the specifics of the situations his characters find themselves in -- transcends all other political labels.|Fresh
I Daniel, Blake is a deeply humane film but I would quibble with what passes for Loach's humour -- it seems grafted on after the serious bits have been dreamed up and gotten out of the way.|Fresh
Comedian Dave Johns is perfect for the dry, canny wit and foul-mouthed invective Loach's usual writer Paul Laverty gives Daniel.|Fresh
Blazing with righteous ire and brimming with compassion, I, Daniel Blake is both a damning portrait of austerity Britain and a tender tribute to human resilience and fellowship.|Fresh
His name is Ken Loach. He makes Ken Loach films. And this is his best in a generation.|Fresh
A realist melodrama that offers little to no nuance.|Rotten
The bluntly black-and-white approach to characterisation is all that jolts you from an otherwise absorbing narrative.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is a small film about unheard voices that punches above its weight, made all the more relevant in the wake of the EU referendum.|Fresh
Loach is a remarkably accomplished film-maker, with an amazing body of work, but this is not him at the top of his game. Which is not to say I don't recommend seeing it.|Fresh
This great British film is guaranteed to make you think and make you feel.|Fresh
While it too often sands the complications off what you sense should feel like an uncomfortably splintery issue, in its best moments, it's a quietly fearsome piece of drama.|Fresh

Fearsomely moving (I cried), and fearsomely tender (I cried again).|Fresh
Very few people can hit you in the thoracic cavity like Loach.|Fresh
Filled with tender moments and warm humour, but shot through with righteous fury over social injustice, this is a passionate and vitally important film that demands to be seen.|Fresh

Loach scans the contemporary landscape, and instead of a firebrand approach of stereotype, delivers a film of immense sadness.|Fresh
The greatest virtue of I, Daniel Blake is its patience in confronting painstakingly the incremental humiliations visited on the neediest in society.|Fresh

It's pock-marked by the conservative dramatic conventions and overt political gestures that have marred much of Ken Loach's recent output.|Rotten
Witty, tender and oh so relevant, it's a lot more fun than it sounds.|Fresh
A timely example of protest filmmaking that speaks to audience's hearts.|Fresh
Like most of Loach and Laverty's recent output, this is a solidly crafted drama with a couple of piercing moments. But it's also a movie designed to make a point rather than tell a story.|Fresh
Defiantly old school, ... it had heart and was undeniably moving, leaving the audience teary-eyed.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is a problematic, but important critique of the British social system.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is as timely today as was Kes in the late 60s or Raining Stones in the 90s.|Fresh

No one possesses the ability to depict the social issues and inequalities plaguing Great Britain quite like Ken Loach and his loyal co-writer Paul Laverty.|Fresh
Quietly dismissing rumblings about Jimmy's Hall being his final film, I, Daniel Blake sees Ken Loach in especially endearing form.|Fresh
I, Daniel Blake is a dignified film containing moments of hilarity and genuine heartbreak. It's a movie dripping with social relevance and shines a light on the red tape bureaucracy that cripples those that are in most need of help.|Fresh
Everything is very noble and the political correctness is added to the film sober correction. However, screenwriter Paul Laverty frequently resorts to sentimentality to make clearer the drama of Daniel Blake. [Full review in spanish]|Fresh
Loach doesn't give a break neither to the poor protanonist or the scared viewer. Everything that he display emerges truth, anger, indignation and denial from that prestigious and unreal thing called social justice. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The problem is that with the course of time, the director's speach has become very thin, and for a few moments it looks like a self-parody. [Full review in spanish]|Rotten
The film has some hard dramatic sequences that some considered excessive, but the performances make this a complete cinematic experience. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The story deffinately works on paper, but some elements just don't really translate well to the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The film compiles tragedies and over does it, it's scenes are predictable and it ends up retelling the hardships the characters have experimented, over, and over again. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
A corker of social-realist agitprop, choicely filmed by Robbie Ryan.|Fresh
[CANNES 2016] Dramatically understated, and yet precisely composed, the film breathes with authenticity and unaffected emotion.|Fresh
At 80, though, the director hasn't lost his knack for telling stories about marginalised characters with wit, anger and humanity.|Fresh

Ken Loach returns to Cannes with a bleak, brilliant, unflinching and heartfelt take on a family under the dark cloud of austerity.|Fresh
Despite its flaws and predictability, it's hard not to be won over by the warmth of its human spirit, as it confronts a subject that sadly remains just as relevant as ever.|Fresh

A spare film, muted in colour - and all the more powerful and urgent for it.|Fresh

This film intervenes in the messy, ugly world of poverty with the secular intention of making us see that it really is happening, and in a prosperous nation, too. I, Daniel Blake is a movie with a fierce, simple dignity of its own.|Fresh
While it might not break new ground, there is no denying the potency of the film's empathetic anguish and fury.|Fresh
While the framework and perspective are familiar, the veteran Brit director's films can still have the power to grip us in an emotional chokehold.|Fresh
