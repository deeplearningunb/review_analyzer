It's an affecting work that refuses to shy away from the vileness of ingrained Islamic intolerance, all of which, in this case, is targeted at women-making the film something like a wrenching live-action companion piece to The Breadwinner.|Fresh
A beautiful and inspiring film that shows how the struggle against patriarchy is taking place everywhere.|Fresh
Hamoud deftly mixes both the intimate and the enormous throughout, endowing vibrantly-shot, slice-of-life storytelling with an often wrenching depth.|Fresh
What is most intriguing about In Between is how each woman is allowed to make mistakes and learn from them without any judgment on Hamoud's part.|Fresh
That lived-in quality to the performances and milieu serve the film well. That combined with Hamoud's unhurried, restrained visual style allows for tension, emotion, and meaning to build together.|Fresh
There's little sense of grievance or victimhood here, only a liberating anger and a sharp but empathic intelligence that pops up in unexpected places.|Fresh
Aided by Itay Gross's intimate cinematography, Hamoud brings a vibrant energy and an unshaken confidence to this tale that we rarely see from a first-time director.|Fresh
... a fascinating debut feature by Maysaloun Hamoud.|Fresh
A propulsive debut from Maysaloun Hamoud.|Fresh
Whether by serendipity or prophetic insight or some combination of the two, it's a perfect movie for the moment.|Fresh
In Between suffers when cross-cutting among its three similar yet disparate storylines, and is strongest during moments that see righteous anger get complicated by human nature.|Fresh
Refreshingly, Hamoud doesn't need to pit women against each other to explore these issues of gender and culture.|Fresh
This expertly crafted narrative shows Arab-Israelis as you've never seen them before, breaking all the major taboos of the group's long-standing culture.|Fresh
It's most affecting when its characters are at their least guarded, but as Nour, Salma, and Laila are hurt by those closest to them, the film pulls back toward more formulaic expressions of conflict.|Rotten
A touch of the exterior plotting is haphazard, but the vital, succinct direction reveals the camaraderie the trio forge, and right up until the masterfully oblique final shot Hamoud never douses the difficulties with an easy triumph.|Fresh
An elegant, sensitive yet still assured and potent debut effort.|Fresh
The three lead actors are superb, creating characters who are tough and vulnerable in equal measure. Their stories tug at the heartstrings but never strain the emotions.|Fresh
Who needs Sex & the City 3? A brave film befitting its brave depiction of women.|Fresh
In Between is a compelling study of Arab women in today's Tel Aviv that's delightful and eye-opening in equal measure.|Fresh
In Between is a charming jab at the patriarchy.|Fresh
The performances are fantastic - as the gorgeous, headstrong Laila, Mouna Hawa is mesmerising.|Fresh
The film's cultural distinctiveness helps a bit... set off by winning performances and all-round vitality.|Fresh
Nothing about the lives of these women appears false or phoney, even when the narrative takes credibility-stretching detours into contrived revenge drama.|Fresh
It's great fun, with a powerful sense of narrative.|Fresh
Kanboura is given more opportunities to convey wider emotional range. Her quiet, studious Nour is the emotional centre of Hamoud's brilliant film.|Fresh
The three leads poignantly convey the stress of living each day in fear and frustration.|Fresh
The script's nuanced treatment of the complex relationships and a feel for the many-faceted, multicultural city in which it's set ... redeem any shortcomings.|Fresh
In Between may seem a little cartoonish at times but ultimately emerges as a joyous celebration of sisterhood.|Fresh
The personal is the political in Maysaloun Hamoud's vibrant, taboo-breaking debut feature ...|Fresh
It doesn't just raise women's voices; it tells a very human story about women who are complex and believable and intriguing.|Fresh
... the film celebrates their resilience and irrepressible good humour in the face of the priggish menfolk who surround them.|Fresh
Creating a beautifully atmospheric, and at times, dazzling world around the women, Hamoud does a commendable job in allowing her protagonists to own their lives and be proud of who they are despite the daily setbacks.|Fresh
"It's sassily directed and terrifically acted. The main virtue of this fizzy, fierce, sometimes funny girls-together gig is that the actresses are ""on"" throughout."|Fresh
Beautifully shot with a great soundtrack and three characters you'll want to remain friends with.|Fresh
"""In Between"" is an energetic and poignant film about three women in different places, yet bonding as they try to find their place in the world together."|Fresh
The trio of leading ladies are all impressive and the script filled with dramatic and satisfying confrontations, but some scenes feel a little too staged to really hit home.|Fresh
hat really stands out about Hamoud's work is that it's female-centric and about sex, and there's not a terrorist in sight. A refreshing, and no doubt challenging, Palestinian film indeed.|Fresh
Together, these women support each other and help each other navigate the murky waters of being outsiders in another culture and emancipated feminists in a world that hasn't quite caught up to their values.|Fresh
They grapple with various issues connected to their race and gender, yet Hamoud keeps the tone relatively light, the women's wit and vibrancy accentuated by a brisk pace and Itay Gross's colorful cinematography.|Fresh
This is one of the most valuable friendship stories of this year, with characters that definitely won't leave the audience indifferent. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hamoud has touched a chord with this complex, moving drama that tells a story that has never been told before.|Fresh
Though there are moments of lightness, this is no Arabic Sex & the City; it goes to darker places ... Tough and touching, [an] intimate gem.|Fresh
