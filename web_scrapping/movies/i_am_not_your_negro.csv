[A] forcefully eloquent movie.|Fresh

I Am Not Your Negro is an accomplished endeavour, and Peck must be commended accordingly - but this is not why it's a special piece of cinema - that derives from Baldwin's writing.|Fresh

Peck...reduces Baldwin's in-the-moment reflections and once-daring insights to the petulance of the Black Lives Matter crusade, which overturns the principles and virtues that King, Malcolm, and Medgar represented before their deaths.|Rotten
While Peck's work brims over with anger and horror, it is also a work of sweeping poetry. This story still isn't pretty, but it's delivered in a captivating and gorgeous manner.|Fresh
Purposefully difficult to watch, yet must be seen.|Fresh

[James Baldwin's] Remember this House was an unfinished work; so too, observes [director] Peck, is America's struggle with race.|Fresh

Peck's transfixing film offers a portrait of the artist as an unshockable man.|Fresh

Despite considerable progress, the film suggests, much work remains to be done - and Baldwin's voice remains as relevant as ever.|Fresh
A brilliant piece of filmic writing, one that bursts with fierce urgency, not just for the long-unresolved history it seeks to confront, but also in its attempt to understand what is happening here, right now.|Fresh
This Oscar-nominated portrait of James Baldwin uses the author's words to bridge the civil-rights past with our racially incendiary present. It's unmissable and unforgettable.|Fresh
He told the truth about the consequences of America's original sin with unblinking, blistering candor, and with a logic of thought and an elegance of affect that made it impossible for a white majority to dismiss what he was saying.|Fresh
"This movie isn't just a tribute to Baldwin. It's a warning bell regarding leaders who, in Baldwin's words, care only about ""their safety and their profits."""|Fresh
A journey of discovery; a path of words and images, taking us into the lives of four African-American men and into the heart of the civil-rights movement.|Fresh
If it revives interest in Baldwin and demonstrates to the public that his work is still vital, 30 years after his death, that would be a service, indeed.|Fresh
By the end... the film has explained how not only action but introspection on the issue(s) of race is a moral and mortal necessity for the republic.|Fresh
Peck's angry, biting, documentary examination of Black-white racial relations in the United States may be a bitter draft to swallow... But it's good for us, because it finally shows us the truth.|Fresh

A bold and copious cinematic bricolage that captures Baldwin as both witness and participant amid the turbulence of the Civil Rights Movement.|Fresh
Offers an accessible but no-less rigorous look at Baldwin's prophetic analysis of racial discord in America.|Fresh

"""I Am Not Your Negro"" is a powerful and eye-opening viewpoint of a man who spent his life fighting for social justice for his race and, by extension, all races."|Fresh
The language is magnificent. As delivered by Samuel L. Jackson, it's one of that great voice's greatest performances.|Fresh
I Am Not Your Negro makes no concessions about its dissatisfaction with the whole rotten lot of so-called western democracy.|Fresh
Given the precarious state of race relations, the late visionary's prescient insights perhaps prove more timely, posthumously, than in their own day.|Fresh
"...it is [Baldwin's] voice that is the greatest takeaway here, Baldwin's passionate and deeply considered arguments irrefutable. Peck's painstaking work is as powerful in content as DuVernay's ""13th"" and a poetic tribute to Baldwin's life."|Fresh
As Peck cuts from archival scenes of police brutality in the South in the '60s to recent footage from Ferguson, Mo., it's impossible not to think: The more things change, the more they stay the same. It's enough to make you weep.|Fresh
An intricate and fascinating narrative.|Fresh
A short capsule review cannot do this documentary's depth of intelligence justice, but suffice to say that it uses history and literature to peel back old wounds and reveal fresh ones.|Fresh
20 years after his death, James Baldwin's voice, passion and insights are just as powerful as ever.|Fresh
With intellectualism once again under assault in America, it's worth remembering that we once produced giants like James Baldwin, and had the good sense to honor and embrace them.|Fresh
Whatever the book would have been, as a film, it is an attempt to make sense of the modern world by looking back at the past through the eyes of somebody whose words are as relevant today as they were then.|Fresh
Peck's references to current events reveal Baldwin's view of history and his prophetic visions to be painfully accurate.|Fresh
Each frame is so relevant, it's terrifying. It's as if James Baldwin rose from the grave, warning us of the horrors we've ignored and the horrors that might be ahead.|Fresh

The most urgent movie of 2016, which seems a strange thing to say about a movie written in the 1980s, predominately about the 1960s. But here we are.|Fresh
Intelligent but sometimes discursive documentary about African-American author James Baldwin.|Fresh
A film essay that's powerfully and painfully relevant today even though its subject died almost 30 years ago.|Fresh
Bringing a sense of gravitas to Baldwin's words is Samuel L. Jackson, whose decidedly nonfurious narration is his finest performance to date, bar none.|Fresh
Just in case you need a reminder that racism is not dead, James Baldwin, the intellectual, civil rights activist and renowned author, has left behind some biting and enlightening words about the subject.|Fresh
"James Baldwin's touch was gentle even when he was taking no prisoners, and he was serious without being earnest. For the most part, so is ""I Am Not Your Negro."""|Fresh
"James Baldwin's requiem for three Civil Rights martyrs is also a letter addressed to future America and its ""vast, unthinking, cruel white majority."""|Fresh
By weaving in old speeches, pieces from other books, and even some visual juxtapositions that maybe only he fully understands, the director makes a persuasive, intuitive case for Baldwin as a poet and a prophet.|Fresh
I Am Not Your Negro travels a straight, well-researched path from the darkest tragedies of American history to the ones that plague the country today.|Fresh
An inspiring documentary on the legacy of the African-American writer and activist.|Fresh
"The jarring, seemingly inevitable transition from Baldwin to today makes clear that for all the progress anyone imagines has been made, ""What's going to happen in this country"" remains exactly the real question."|Fresh
The words of James Baldwin, heard (spoken by actor Samuel L. Jackson) and seen in this film, reach out to us from the past, reminding us that we haven't come as far as we think we have. We are still trapped in a history we don't fully understand.|Fresh
The evidence here is more intrinsically spiritual than fact-based, and, in the process, Peck has made one of this year's finest documentaries.|Fresh
It looks back at the volatile civil rights era, as it treats Baldwin as a capable voice to speak for the angry outsiders about racial bias and about being black in America.|Fresh
Sorry, the dubious positive critical response, begs the question of Baldwin's intent to disturb and provoke, not placate guilt-free white privilege. And with the ironic effect of twisting the notion of The Other, as not me but 'those whites over there.'|Rotten
Memoir, analytical polemic, and behind them both the restless movement of an intellect fearlessly probing both itself and its situation in the world: Raoul Peck combines all three in I Am Not Your Negro.|Fresh
Narrated by a restrained and unrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson, the film presents a compelling case of history that is still just as relevant and prudent today.|Fresh
"If you watch ""I Am Not Your Negro,"" you'll spend a kaleidoscopic and transporting 90 minutes living inside James Baldwin's mind, coming thrillingly close to his existential perception of the hidden meaning of race in America."|Fresh

A stirring, stinging memorial.|Fresh
