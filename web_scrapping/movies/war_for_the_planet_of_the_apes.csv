As Caesar, Andy Serkis delivers in ways that make the Academy's refusal to acknowledge his work all the more embarrassing.|Fresh
[Matt] Reeves' fandom since childhood for the franchise is evident in every frame of his Apes pictures. This is a grim story of loss and hate and revenge, told against the even-grimmer backdrop of the literal end of the human race.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes does a fantastic job of rebuking toxic masculinity and centering nonverbal communication, but it forgets to lift up women or people of color in its ambitious goals.|Fresh
Whilst War for the Planet of the Apes' title may be somewhat misleading, the film itself is anything but a letdown.|Fresh
It makes the fall of humanity an engaging spectacle. And now I openly welcome our new ape overlords.|Fresh
There is inelegance here between expression and meaning that is jarring, and makes this a grim watch at times.|Rotten
The end result isn't quite as effective as Dawn before it, but War delivers the emotional heft to bring the trilogy full circle. Can we give Serkis an Oscar nomination yet?|Fresh
As simians and Homo sapiens touch base with their lowest, the Planet of the Apes' prequel series reaches its peak in quality.|Fresh
A chillingly daring finale that swings through the vines, leaps, and sticks the landing, providing a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy.|Fresh
What could have just been a title-grab sequel is instead a genuinely moving experience.|Fresh
"War for the Planet of the Apes builds on a central tenet - ""apes together strong"" - and sends out resonating values that we can all learn something from."|Fresh
Andy Serkis' Cesar is incredibly spot on, the strong core of this morality play versus Woody Harrelson's Colonel, the embodiment of human evil.|Fresh
Go apes!|Fresh
I was captivated from the start, and remained awed throughout. It seems the third time's the charm for this latter-day reboot of the Apes franchise. It's consummately grand and original.|Fresh
An eerily symbolic narrative that fuses multiple genres (prison film, melodrama) with deeply political subtext about hate and isolation.|Fresh
Never has Caesar been better developed and searched than in this film.|Fresh
You cannot help but root for Caesar as much as you cannot shake the feeling that in the gamut of life and evolution humans may not deserve to be saved.|Fresh
Despite its 2.5 hour run-time, it never feels dull, with a constant complex yet natural progression.|Fresh
It's what sets great science fiction apart from another Michael Bay Transformers movie: decisions having real benefits and consequences that may not be readily apparent.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is definitely the most fable-like movie in the rebooted Apes trilogy, with its starkly defined war of good apes against evil humans. But it's also the most character-driven story too.|Fresh
Having the technology to capture said performances is extremely gratifying, as War for the Planet of the Apes gives a legitimacy to a season otherwise known for less intelligent films.|Fresh
This is that rare film capable of holding even the most boisterous and fidgety of audiences in stunned silence, all the more impressive when it's while a room full of CGI apes are communicating via sign language. That is cinema.|Fresh

It has the freshness of a story that you're hearing for the first time.|Fresh
... does not disappoint. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
... a memorable piece of modern big budget filmmaking.|Fresh
I found the machinations tedious - the film is more than two hours long - and there isn't much tension regarding the eventual outcome.|Rotten
Reeves combines the feel of a war movie like Apocalypse Now or Platoon with the flashy special effects you find in most summer movies. This gives us a rare Hollywood blockbuster that is as deep in story as it is dazzling to watch.|Fresh
Who'd have predicted that the prequel to a 1968 movie about a planet of simians who speak like humans would become the most intelligent franchise of the new century?|Fresh
A fitting send-off to one of the best blockbuster trilogies in modern cinema.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is poetic blockbuster storytelling, the kind we don't see enough of anymore. Director Matt Reeves continues to excel handling delicate subject material|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes manages a deft balance between allusion, esotericism, and obviousness that in part explains the runaway success of the series.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes brings the trilogy to an end with a fitting conclusion.|Fresh
It tries to hold a mirror up to humanity, but merely provides a romp through a forest of empty signifiers.|Rotten
Simply put, this study of humanity is phenomenal cinema.|Fresh
A stirring conclusion that features great special effects and another incredible performance from Andy Serkis.|Fresh
The action, as in the previous films, is intense and the pacing is brisk, which isn't usually the case for a film almost 2 1/2 hours long. That being said, if this is the final film in the series it's going out on top. Hail Caesar!|Fresh
"""Sequelitis"" is like the simian flu that's killing off the human population. It's easy to catch. But, director-co-writer Matt Reeves and writer Mark Bomback apparently got their flu shots."|Fresh
Andy Serkis for another thundering performance. If you thought he was good as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films, then his superlative performance here will just blow your mind away.|Fresh
While War pivots around the test of wills of the colonel and Caesar, the movie demonstrates a sense of humor, particularly with Steve Zahn's Bad Ape, who got his name by being admonished so often by humans.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that balances action and special effects well enough to make it stand out from all the blockbusters seen so far this year.|Fresh
Reeves has made the closest thing to a silent movie that we will likely have in today's Hollywood zeitgeist|Fresh
"There's no doubt the end result here is impressive. But if Serkis does ever win anything, he'd be wise to make the visual-effects team first on his list of ""people to thank""."|Fresh
Consistent with the latest generation of these Boulle-based films that started in 2011, it examines the question of who is bestial. Man or ape? It answers the question with an intelligence not often found in Hollywood blockbusters.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is concerned less with spectacle than it is with delving into how one defines humanity and what are the right paths to take in order to claim rightful equality.|Fresh
These are movies about gorillas who ride horses that feel, at first blush, like kiddie fare. And yet, once you take the step to suspend your disbelief, this is one of the sharpest franchises about the human condition.|Fresh
While it is dark in places, War rounds out one of the best trilogies out there.|Fresh
[War for the Planet of the Apes] puts such a perfect period on the saga, not an ellipsis.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is a statelier affair: The special effects get even more detailed, convincing, and gorgeous; the ongoing story deepens and expands; and the reviews get better and better.|Fresh
Screenwriter Mark Bomback elevates the idea of self-sacrifice in service of a worthy cause, something that human beings have trouble achieving in both the movie and in real life.|Fresh
The best of the new Planet of the Apes movies...|Fresh
It's impressive for a 2017 CGI-dominated popcorn movie to be this much of a gravely sober-minded character drama as this.|Fresh
A deeply emotional and visceral experience. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A solid general execution of the story, a multidimensional villain and an emotional anticlimatic resolution. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The most crude and dark of the deliveries of this saga with another remarkable narrative, visual and acting work (with Andy Serkis giving back to the chair). [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
These are characters. They are also animals, and when they are slain, there's a ghastly novelty to it, one that has long ago worn off the spectacle of dying humans|Fresh
An exciting, moving closing chapter that again punches the thesis that humans have no inherent right to presume dominion over the earth... We often complain about reboots and sequels. The Apes series is a prime example of how to do it right.|Fresh
It's a movie that chooses to focus on its characters instead of on explosive action sequences. [Full review on Portuguese.]|Fresh
A film that is enjoyed in all its extensions and all its layers. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is a basic allegory that flirts, dangerously, with becoming an outright social issue drama.|Rotten
"With Reeves' metaphors all face-up, ""War"" becomes nothing but an awfully literal conclusion of a trilogy that once hinted at much bigger, more symbolic things."|Rotten
Matt Reeves's 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a rare work, in which the power of the ideas matches the skill of the craft.|Fresh
Dark, tense and exciting. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A whole show of action, fighting and technological advances, in a more serious tone. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Seeing Caesar bound to a cross, or watching apes enslaved to work and die when they yearn for their own promised land, you could easily surmise that Reeves has pulled off a genre that Hollywood hasn't come close to mastering in decades: the biblical epic.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is overall a polished work that often explodes before your eyes into something truly radiant.|Fresh
Although this film is a war movie, apes and gorillas teach us in their powerful film metaphor, that together we are all stronger and can take care of our Planet Earth. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A very good remake and a visually fascinating war movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Flawless.|Fresh
The loss of conflict within the human characters takes a toll, as War lacks Dawn's multifaceted interplay of politics and genuine emotional connection among human and ape characters.|Fresh
One of the greatest blockbusters of our time.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is a film fans of the Apes saga, and newfound fans of the prequels, will find as a satisfying addition to the series. Believe the hype.|Fresh
Though the Apes franchise has weathered crests and drops in its various iterations, it's at its best when it probes the moral complexities at its core.|Fresh
Part of this film's allure is the way it makes you feel sympathetic towards the apes and their plight. They're the ones with traits such as warmth and forgiveness.|Fresh
Reeves tells a big story that's satisfying in many ways.|Fresh
The current Planet of the Apes franchise is just so insufferably earnest, with a po-faced quality seldom seen outside of Biblical movies.|Rotten
A universal lesson landed in an entertaining metaphor, which although it's not the best delivery of the saga, it does offer a quite decent outcome. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that refuses to be an outcome plagued by meaningless action. As a war film is brutal thanks to its depressing images. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
When digital cinema captures texture as sensuously and as precisely as this, a film can be a treat not just for blockbuster adepts but for the most rarefied aesthetes too.|Fresh
The final installment of the rebooted Planet of the Apes series is spectacular stuff, but also admirably grim and apocalyptic.|Fresh
This is an action adventure so viewers will expect a climactic confrontation between the two main characters, Caesar and The Colonel. It does come, but it is nothing like what we have come to expect from superhero films, and is outstanding as a result.|Fresh
Majestic. Breathtaking. A Masterpiece. Use all the best words then invent new ones. War for the Planet of the Apes is an astonishing achievement.|Fresh
Matt Reeves demonstrates that he is able to turn a summer blockbuster into a work of enormous expressiveness and revealing symbolic scope. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
In spite of its mistakes, the bold and intelligent development of the film isn't only profound, but also very pertinent to the times in which we live. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film shows that the same themes of the first delivery can continue to be explored and surprise us with each sequel. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
When it comes time to talk about the greatest trilogies of all time, the new Planet Of The Apes films need to be in the discussion.|Fresh
Don't understate the achievements of the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise. It got us to actively root against the survival of the human race.|Fresh
"Reeves has delivered the level of quality that Paul Greengrass did concluding the original ""Bourne"" Trilogy."|Fresh
As with [the first three Star Wars movies and The Lord of The Rings], the second is the best, the first is the most fun, and the last is a long, noble conclusion.|Fresh
The barriers that divide text from subtext and meta-text are torn down in War for the Planet of the Apes; instead we get all of them at once in a pasteurized soup of signification.|Rotten
Two movies past the wit and virtuosity of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the formerly amazing creatures have become no more involving than any other characters who slog toward a trilogy's last paycheck.|Rotten
It also roams an exalted plane of entertainment few blockbusters ever reach: crafting fare of a fine calibre that satisfies thrill seekers and deep thinkers alike.|Fresh
Full marks to the filmmakers, though, for bringing the ape cast to life with incredible verisimilitude. Whether it's down to Serkis or a room full of animators, there are vast wells of humanity in Caesar's performance.|Fresh
Ultimately, War for the Planet of the Apes feels more like its ticking boxes to get to a foregone conclusion rather than arriving there organically.|Fresh
The film is a wonderful meditation on the price that has to be paid when violence seems to be the only answer. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This movie is far above most sequels. It represents the crowning achievement in a storied film franchise which has seen significant highs and laughable lows in the past.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is the most ambitious out of the three Apes prequels. Director Matt Reeves (who co-wrote the screenplay with Mark Bomback) has created a bleak saga that is as beautiful as it is dull.|Rotten
This is highly engaging stuff, told at what in any other series we'd call a human level.|Fresh
This is a journey that must be seen in cinemas and a finale to one of the greatest contemporary trilogies in recent memory.|Fresh
When used artfully, motion capture has reached a point where we no longer think about the technology we're seeing, just the character. And Caesar is a great one.|Fresh
Isn't as visually impressive as its predecessors and has an unsatisfactory ending. It's the least effective of the three films|Rotten
Despite some lapses in subtlety, War for the Planet of the Apes makes the incredible mostly credible.|Fresh
I let out a visceral trill of delight every time I saw an ape on horseback. It's an unbelievably cool image. If this concludes Reeves's run with the series, deficiencies aside, it'll stand as one of the good ones.|Fresh
It saddens me to report that, though there are still great scenes of primate conflict, the third film of the trilogy succumbs in the end to fatal chicken-heartedness.|Rotten
I highly recommend to see it in cinemas, so you won't lose the spectacular sound and image that the film delivers. If you can see the previous ones, much better, although this one is enjoyable by itself. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Weirdly, the Charlton Heston film that War has most in common with is not the one you'd expect: with an actual plague visited down on humans and a Cecil B. DeMille finale, Caesar is more Moses than Dr. Zaius.|Fresh
Reeves would have done well to trim this effort down to under two hours, but it still develops the apes more than previous films.|Fresh
...appropriately momentous, then elegiac.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes follows Spider-Man: Homecoming as an example of how to allow a franchise to continue to expand and breathe rather than trying to keep it mired in by-the-numbers numbness.|Fresh
The third in a series of sci-fi epics that surges with an unflinching focus on spiritual matters.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is a classic example of how a little zany but well-made science fiction can offer more to the audience than a few special effects.|Fresh
Reeves makes the most of the setting, bringing dynamism and visual variety to the plot's different episodes, which include several excellent action sequences... Yet there's a deeper lack of momentum in the film.|Fresh
Few summer blockbusters make the brain tick and the heart race at the same time. Is is too early too call this the blockbuster of the summer?|Fresh
All science fiction is philosophy; here, Reeves asks what distinguishes humans from animals.|Fresh
We've been trained to think Caesar is noble, Koba is flawed, and the Colonel is evil. The truth is that Caesar is flawed, Koba is a victim, and the Colonel is weak.|Fresh
Hints at cultural relevance-a madman must build at wall at all costs to keep other humans out-however well-intentioned as commentary blurt like sound cannons.|Fresh
Nothing beats the 1968 original, but this third sci-fi reboot holds up as second best in the series.|Fresh
evokes the sort of tough-minded historical war drama John Milius used to write, with an eye on what war can do to the individual.|Fresh
The energy and confidence that the director demonstrates manages to build a universe so viscerally recognizable as strange. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An impeccable film of risky dramatic range, taking into account its commercial ambitions, and unquestionable political message. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
All in all, War for the Planet of the Apes is as heart-wrenching as it is disappointing at times, with still some of the best performances we've seen from non-human characters in a long while.|Fresh
It's smart, sombre and defiantly old-fashioned.|Fresh
It's a strange enough dynamic where the audience is rooting for the victory of another species but this is where this movie, serious in all senses, takes us.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is one of the great summertime tentpole adventures in recent memory, Reeves delivering a science fiction epic almost certain to stand the test of time.|Fresh
epic in scope, it is also a dialectic on [kindness], that most humane of qualities for which, in a perfect world, nature would select.|Fresh
It is because of Serkis's nuanced and emotionally affecting work that in a showdown between people and apes, our sympathies are with the apes. In all the ways that matter, they are more human than the humans.|Fresh
Matt Reeves does an exquisite job balancing tone and keeping a serious franchise about a ridiculous situation consistent and sincere.|Fresh
The film's visuals are splendid, epic, and remind you of a David Lean film.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes brings the prequel trilogy to an operatic finale with a psychological drama as thrilling as its combat set pieces.|Fresh
"Well, humanity, we've had a great run. We put men on the moon, invented the ""frork,"" and, once in a while, we can make a summer blockbuster movie that's as thoughtful as it is exciting."|Fresh
The effects are outstanding and the rendition of the ape heroes is still a joy to watch.|Fresh
War of the Planet of the Apes can be celebrated for not only being a worthy installment of one of the best screen trilogies of recent memory but for pulling off the equally difficult task of ending it on just the right note as well.|Fresh
Few summer blockbusters make the brain tick and the heart race at the same time -- this could turn out to be the blockbuster of the summer.|Fresh
Any flaws found in War for the Planet of the Apes are offset by Serkis' Caesar. He anchors the film with a humanity and genuine emotion that is all too rare in films with no CGI characters.|Fresh
This is essentially the ape version of The Great Escape.|Rotten
War For the Planet of the Apes is one of the best films of the year and is Serkis's best performance to date.|Fresh
Serkis' consistently brilliant voice-acting is perfectly complemented by the motion-capture work and animation for Caesar's face, which manages to look convincingly like a chimpanzee while emoting exactly like a human.|Fresh
Andy Serkis's superb performance and Matt Reeves's heartfelt direction means that for once, humans will root against their own species.|Fresh
Matt Reeves' film engages the mind and the senses in equal measure, resulting in top notch entertainment.|Fresh
War For The Planet of The Apes... stands as a deeply impressive achievement and a shining example of how franchises can test audiences as much as they entertain.|Fresh
The surprisingly thoughtful prequel trilogy comes to a powerful conclusion with this robust, dramatic thriller, which avoids most of the annoying cliches of action blockbusters to offer something much deeper.|Fresh
On the whole, War is both a reasonable possible conclusion to the ape's arc and a solid preparation for whatever comes next.|Fresh
Not only smart, dazzling and entertaining, it speaks to fears and concerns that are as relevant today as they were in the 1960s when the series originated.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes triumphantly caps this Apes trilogy. Equally remarkable, it leaves you wanting more.|Fresh
The best blockbuster of the summer movie season, a furry fable for our times. All hail Apocalypse Ape.|Fresh
Swinging into theaters, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is thought-provoking escapism.|Fresh
A hefty performance by Andy Serkis and an epic climax manage to penetrate the heart of darkness in this solemn and dreary finale to the latest 'Apes' trilogy. It obviously needs a few more monkey shines.|Fresh
Reeves and co are on course to deliver something truly special. Yet it isn't quite to be.|Fresh
The spectacle? Brilliant, as you'd expect.|Fresh
Humans bad. Apes good. Rinse. Lather. Repeat.|Fresh
This is a combat-mission film and a jailbreak movie, and if you can take the sight of digitally rendered chimpanzees and orangutans enacting Braveheart-style heroics, it succeeds on both counts.|Fresh
A work of blockbuster art that carries its huge budget lightly.|Fresh
The most powerful of an already strong trilogy, with a message that has never felt more timely and a gorgeous curtain call for a character who has quietly climbed into the realm of greatness.|Fresh
"A strikingly intimate second sequel that fully delivers on the empathy ""Rise"" introduced and ""Dawn"" developed, making viewers feel just about everything for these damn dirty apes."|Fresh
Intermittently funny and dour, alternately dull and exciting, and grasping for depth when it isn't content to settle for sentiment.|Fresh
Although War for the Planet of the Apes dips into myth-making, it is visually tremendous and thematically complicated, a well-done link to the original classic.|Fresh
If he weren't acting with dots on his face to be replaced by a detailed computer simulation of an upright chimpanzee, it would be all but impossible to deny Serkis an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.|Fresh
It might be the first great post-human movie, and an almost Biblical conclusion to one of the finest modern trilogies. All hail Matt Reeves.|Fresh
"Personally I found it all a bit distasteful and more than a little unpleasant. Cool shout-outs to ""Schindler's List"" though, bro."|Rotten
Triumphantly completes one of the historically great trilogies in modern cinema.|Fresh
"Featuring the finest example of motion capture effects in the series to date, ""War"" successfully makes us care deeply about the apes and their struggle."|Fresh
The brilliance of the film is that it works so well on various levels. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
The special effects are amazing, and the long takes and measured pace give War the flavor of an old-school impossible-mission epic, but there's something sociopathic about the way the film portrays the eradication of humanity as heroic.|Fresh
What we're left with in War for the Planet of the Apes is an absorbing, intelligent finale.|Fresh
I see a lot of giant effects pictures -- it's an occupational hazard -- and I'd love to see more of them adopt the approach used in War For The Planet Of The Apes: make the effects invisible, and just tell a good story.|Fresh
It's a rare thing these days for a franchise to only get better as the series progresses.|Fresh
Around the 20-minute mark in War for the Planet of the Apes a bizarre and wonderful thing occurs. You, the viewer, start to feel like a monkey. No, really.|Fresh
Even if you're somehow still on the fence, by the time the stunning War for the Planet of the Apes turns into a variation on The Great Esc-Ape, you'll be beating your chest with excitement and joy.|Fresh
It's a fantastic finish to a brainy trilogy that favours moral dilemmas over explosions, but finds room for a few of those too.|Fresh
This is an absolutely fantastic, exciting finale to what has been a phenomenal trilogy. Please don't let it end!|Fresh
[A] brilliant, beautiful, breathtaking blockbuster filled with grand performances and gripping emotional storytelling... [T]he must-see movie of the Summer...|Fresh
Suspenseful, mournful, grand, sensitively performed by the ape-actors, and told with such visual authority that whenever the humans start flapping their fancy gums you sort of resent it.|Fresh
The rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise is getting bleaker, and better, as it progresses|Fresh
There has been sporadic talk of continuing the Apes franchise, but to avoid a repetition of history, it might be best to stop it with this one. You don't monkey around with perfection.|Fresh
Serkis is brilliant and memorable and sometimes absolutely heartbreaking as Caesar. The supporting players excel, with each getting a moment or two in the sun.|Fresh
Here is entertainment and social commentary done big, bold and razor sharp.|Fresh
It's fitting that a movie that features both crossbows and laser-guided rifles, tanks as well as horseback riding feels classic and contemporary at the same time.|Fresh
[War for the Planet of the Apes is] a film that feels newly minted, and daringly conceived on an epic scale. It's as if no one bothered to tell the filmmakers that Hollywood doesn't do grandeur anymore.|Fresh
Reeves and Bomback are determined to keep this extended prequel smart and the dialogue impressively lean, even as the story begins to wear as it stretches towards the 2 1/2-hour mark.|Fresh
It has something to say, and says it with a cinematic sensibility that's uncommon in most movies, let alone big-budget epics.|Fresh
'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a summer blockbuster told with skill that entertains, as well as offering some ideas that make you ponder whether humans are as advanced as we think we are.|Fresh
"Apologies to Charlton Heston loyalists, but ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is a good example of how today's movies sometimes beat the hell out of the oldies."|Fresh
It's a melancholy film but a hopeful one, with a combination of technical wizardry and soulful acting that's nothing less than extraordinary.|Fresh
It forces audiences to struggle honestly with the question of what separates humans from every other species in nature and whether that difference means we're truly superior or simply the arrogant place holder for whatever comes next.|Fresh
"""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is a work made of anthropomorphized animals and computerized smoke and mirrors, but at its core is an urgency that we like to associate with being human. The movie makes you wonder if it's time to rethink that."|Fresh
How? How did this happen? How has Fox's rebooted Planet of the Apes series emerged, against all odds, as the most compelling, most morally resonant franchise of our times?|Fresh
"""War for the Planet of the Apes"" may have the body of an action film, but it has the soul of an art-house drama and the brains of a political thriller."|Fresh
Exciting, suspenseful, emotional, and given a thrillingly subversive edge by the fact that you're actively willing the destruction of humanity.|Fresh
While it might be loaded with technology, it has been tamed to serve the story -- even if the humans in it are a bunch of cretins.|Fresh
It's moving and smart and jammed with action you care about rather than yawn at.|Fresh
A stirring, soulful conclusion to a trilogy that has brilliantly evolved from its original source, claiming the admittedly not-very-competitive crown as the summer's best sequel.|Fresh
It is a subversively thrilling treat to see the masterworks of art and cinema given the monkey business so expertly, the process enriching rather than lessening the stature of those works.|Fresh
The more engrossing intraspecies relationships have disappeared, and the simian ones lack the verbal wit that animated the original series.|Rotten
"""War"" functions as both a payback Western and a road movie before settling into an ""Avatar""-style death match pitting nature versus technology."|Fresh
Of all three Apes movies, this is the most knowing, relatable, and intensely realized depiction of humanity's end and the hyper-intelligent chimps, gorillas, and orangutans' taking over the planet.|Fresh
The sentimentality on display verges on saccharine, but the wild action sequences, lush photography, and first-rate production-design make up for it.|Fresh
"Sci-fi has become the domain for mindless action and spectacle, but ""War"" is something different, a subdued and somber science fiction film, with only small pockets of action."|Fresh
The rebooted franchise goes out with a bang - and a career-high performance from motion-capture maestro Andy Serkis|Fresh
Read all the allegories and allusions you want into it, at its heart though War is innovative, intelligent and indelible cinema.|Fresh
Where Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was a vaguely plausible parable about the dangers of scientists messing with nature, this one doesn't have an original thought about anything.|Rotten
Caesar is one of the most interesting heroes in recent mainstream cinema. Thoughtful, melancholic and empathetic, he is the opposite of the standard-issue Hollywood protagonist.|Fresh
A polished diamond in the middle of disposable summer garbage. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes bucks the trend of late-franchise films as creatively bankrupt cash grabs. This is a vital, original, and emotionally potent chapter to one of the longest-running movie series out there.|Fresh
[T]his is an unexpected but thematically sound way to end a series that always has been more interested in ideas than spectacle.|Fresh
Following on from Dawn and Rise, War for the Planet of the Apes is a great end to a series known for its blend of action, heart and social commentary.|Fresh
Perfect ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of the best movies of the year, certainly the summer, and one of the strongest close to a trilogy ever done. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Flawed but impressive, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" finds its place comfortably, and near the top, of a surprisingly satisfying summer season."|Fresh
It would be hard to overstate just how singular this picture feels in its seriousness of purpose and in its cumulative power to enthrall and astonish.|Fresh
A superb example - rare in this era of sloppily constructed, commercially hedged cinematic universes - of clear thinking wedded to inventive technique in popular filmmaking.|Fresh
Without giving too much of the story away, if the film truly is holding a mirror up to life, we, as a species, might like to reconsider some of our recent actions.|Fresh
Reeves's story ends up echoing a very old one-essentially, Moses leading his people out of bondage and into freedom-without weaving in any nuance. War for the Planet of the Apes is an epic, to be sure-but an epic slog.|Rotten
We should praise Caesar, and all the other apes, as often as we can. Theirs is a moving story told with skill and sincerity, rarer commodities than we humans would like to admit.|Fresh
Between the sophisticated storytelling and the state-of-the-art special f/x, War for the Planet of the Apes turns out to be a touching swan song well worth the wait.|Fresh
The franchise has reached the level where the story is a hash of other films, including Harry Potter and any western that takes the side of the Indians.|Fresh
At times, you suspect the filmmakers are throwing in humour, action and pathos simply as a way to distract from the extreme pessimism that's really at the core of their story.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes seals Caesar's place in the pantheon of movie messiahs and the trilogy's place among the finest ever.|Fresh
Proves that big movies aren't incompatible with big ideas.|Fresh
"""War for the Planet of the Apes"" stands on its own --- it is the summer blockbuster!"|Fresh
"""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is easily one of the year's best films. ... a truly exciting and superior cinematic adventure."|Fresh
"With emotionally resonant stories, thrilling heroics, and trenchant cultural observations, the ""Apes"" franchise is a rare breed of blockbuster, where filmmakers have been given the freedom to tell the stories they want, the way they want."|Fresh
At this point I actually see no technical barrier to Andy Serkis playing Woody Harrelson.|Fresh
"While I've championed a new ""hybrid"" or ""motion capture"" category to be instituted, Serkis' work is worthy of enough to be considered among the best lead performances delivered this year."|Fresh
Screenwriter Mark Bomback has taken the characters to a deeper and more conflicted place.|Fresh
In its pulpy way, War for the Planet of the Apes -- vigorously directed by Matt Reeves from Mark Bomback's screenplay -- captures the zeitgeist.|Fresh
This series of Apes films has gotten progressively better and more thoughtful. Written and directed by Matt Reeves... War functions as both examination of society's here and now and as homage to the original series.|Fresh
Hail, Caesar. Hail, Andy Serkis. Same thing.|Fresh
Gripping, visually assured and working far above its summer-sequel paygrade, [Apes] treats a harsh storyline with a solemnity designed to hoist the tale of Caesar, simian revolutionary -- the Moses of apes -- into the realm of the biblical.|Fresh
Call off the search -- the summer's first show-stopper is here.|Fresh
If ape-on-human action is all you crave, this War delivers, but by comparison to its ancestors, and even Fox's own Logan this year, it comes up shallow|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is a formidable achievement: not just the rare last chapter in a trilogy that maintains the high quality of the first two, but a visually lush, heart-pounding summer action movie that dares to ask hard questions ...|Fresh
Maintains the high quality of the first two episodes, bringing the story to a solid, if preordained, conclusion in a narratively imaginative fashion.|Fresh
The movie's bold, irreverent use of movie mythology, from The Bridge on the River Kwai to Apocalypse Now, adds to the stirring, immersive entertainment.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes manages to be both alienating and sappy, and the biblical finale seems to come from a different universe altogether. It's an awesome, dull movie.|Rotten
A canny blend of Heart of Darkness with the grandeur of an old Hollywood biblical epic, peppered with some intense set pieces.|Fresh
It's refreshing to see a blockbuster that - until the end at least - isn't all about carnage and mayhem.|Fresh
A magnificent end for one of the best trilogies in the history of film. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It treats the end of the world as the apocalypse we've always been racing ourselves into, and the one we won't be able to prevent even as we see it coming.|Fresh
A triumph of science fiction storytelling: a sweeping tale of mythological scope told with astonishing FX wizardry that brings emotion and intelligence to nonhuman people.|Fresh
A shockingly memorable movie, the kind that gets better as you dissect and discuss how much it does right after the lights have gone up.|Fresh
The trilogy's intense yet introspective last chapter is engulfed in a heart of darkness.|Fresh
An audacious, idiosyncratic piece of blockbuster filmmaking: a mix of Pixar, revenge Westerns, and Apocalypse Now ...|Fresh
This is not the film to breathe fresh life into the franchise; it's a dark and dreary chapter with far too many eggs in its pudding.|Rotten
Too gloomy to provide many summer-blockbuster thrills, but too silly to be a serious art-house allegory, the film is best left to completists. It just isn't a very profound or moving film - although it does sometimes ape one.|Rotten
Harrelson stares and sneers with fanatical relish, but War is ultimately a two-man show, with Reeves giving the material an aesthetic polish and pulse-pounding energy ... and Andy Serkis again bringing commanding complexity and grace to Caesar.|Fresh
This is a masterly, mesmerising piece of work.|Fresh
It unleashes an action-packed story underpinned with moral dilemmas, life and death decisions, social commentary and real emotional heft.|Fresh
Though war is waged in exhilarating style, it is the strength of the characters' emotions that will leave you well and truly shaken.|Fresh
Perhaps this is a fitting end to a franchise that had absolutely no right to produce movies as good as it did.|Fresh
Reeves direction, the writing, the performances from the actors, none of it would work without the team at WETA Digital delivering the goods in what can comfortably be declared a watershed moment in special effects.|Fresh
Reeves casts a moody, noirish, embattled spell. There are daring, endearingly dotty hints of a homage to Heart of Darkness.|Fresh
Sensational. A fully realized, fascinating world. The best film of 2017...so far.|Fresh
Awesome and elegiac, as humanity is reflected back through the apes. A 'must see' for lovers of this franchise.|Fresh
If 20th Century Fox does in fact step away from the franchise with this 2017 entry, then they're sending this captivating series off on a high note by saving the best of the lot for last.|Fresh
More glum and formulaic than deep...If I want to watch a celebration of America in decline, I just turn on Fox News.|Rotten
Matt Reeves caps the trilogy with an epic story, but it is Andy Serkis's interior battle, Caesar's humanity dueling with his simian instincts, that is the single most spectacular element of the film.|Fresh
A full-fledged hit. A closing of a trilogy to which, for once, we wish that more films arrive. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I still don't feel like I've even come close to giving War for the Planet of the Apes the due it deserves; I just loved it so very much, as Reeves gave me everything I was hoping for and beyond as a fan.|Fresh
This is a brilliant technical achievement but it's more than that. It's a potent, political and moving work of SF with a stunning performance from Andy Serkis.|Fresh
Apart from pulling off the unique trick of having us root for human extinction, War foregrounds a beautiful tension between the savage instinct for retribution and higher restraint -- ironically fought within the heart of an animal.|Fresh
There's ape betrayal, ape bravery, ape joy and lots of ape action in War for the Planet of the Apes. Yet the picture's plot mechanics aren't nearly as significant or as memorable as its characters are.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is a deeply emotional, riveting film that pushes the boundaries of motion capture performance.|Fresh
If War of the Planet of the Apes doesn't take the summer blockbuster to new heights, it's still an exceptionally well-crafted film.|Fresh
"A blue-ribbon technical achievement with plenty of vividly contemplative layers underneath, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is an adult-minded summer tentpole providing the requisite eye candy without sacrificing its intellect or storytelling maturity."|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is the perfect emotional ending to one of the best movie trilogies of all time.|Fresh
All hail Caesar as War For The Planet Of The Apes and director Matt Reeves gets it absolutely right and produces the best Apes movie on the planet.|Fresh
Although War can be seen as a larger parable about the shortcomings of the human race, in the short term, it's a powerful reflection of America in decline.|Fresh
This is blockbuster filmmaking at its best, providing summer thrills with deep characterization the likes of which we simply don't see that often anymore.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is a stunning masterpiece. It's brutal, bleak and authentically moving.|Fresh
It would be a bold, daring, heavy drama even if it were humans. The fact that it's apes only makes it more extraordinary.|Fresh
An exquisitely filmed, emotionally stunning film that challenges what a big-budget, summer blockbuster is supposed to be.|Fresh
After the last film's ballistic finale, it would have been easy for Matt Reeves to sit back and hurl fur and fireballs at the screen for two hours... [but] War is a more subtle beast than its title implies.|Fresh
Almost as rare as winning the Triple Crown in horse racing is to make a film trilogy that clicks from beginning to end, but Fox has pretty much pulled it off with its refurbished Planet of the Apes trio.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes provides a thrilling conclusion to the trilogy, an action-packed and emotionally devastating epic.|Fresh
Perhaps the greatest virtue of War for the Planet of the Apes is that it captures the futility of war without ever glamorizing the abhorrent carnage.|Fresh
Artfully shot and mournfully scored, there's no denying the craft that's been poured into this, even if it's set to be one of the summer's more heavy-going blockbusters.|Fresh
Regardless of what happens or doesn't happen next for the Planet of the Apes, this installment is very simply a great time at the movies.|Fresh
With War for the Planet of the Apes, technological wizardry and first-rate storytelling combine into a bracing action-adventure that concludes the best science fiction trilogy since the original trio of Star Wars movies.|Fresh
Apes together strong indeed.|Fresh
Reeves marshals more than his fair share of battle scenes and sweeping set-pieces, but never forgets the flicker of a face can provide all the spectacle that cinema requires.|Fresh
Finally, with War, we see both sides becoming increasingly desperate, leading to an examination of which species truly is the most human. It's the absolute perfect end to this trilogy.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes isn't just a near perfect example of what a summer blockbuster should look like, but rather of what all films should aspire to accomplish.|Fresh
The third film of by far the finest and most vital Hollywood franchise around is dark, aching and outstanding.|Fresh
The satisfying and heart-wrenching climax is a last reminder that Caesar's new adventure is one of this summer's best.|Fresh
Like Caesar and company, the films seem to be getting more intelligent and human as they evolve.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is as satisfying a conclusion to Caesar's journey as it is a compelling standalone, big-budget blockbuster experience.|Fresh
While War for the Planet of the Apes's third act is a bit hairy, the sequel helps cement the franchise as one of the more exciting mainstream properties worth watching.|Fresh
Like its two predecessors, it has its flaws - and each entry has had unique ones - but overall, this is a trilogy that will stand as an example of how to remake and reimagine familiar material in a way that respects the original while also enhancing it.|Fresh
Matt Reeves' film makes no bones about being anything less than its aspirations: a patient, deliberate, and occasionally devastating drama about an ape of mythic quality.|Fresh
Matt Reeves' stunner climbs to new heights, not just technically but emotionally, assuring this as not just one of the year's most ambitious, but powerful entertainments.|Fresh
War for the Planet of the Apes is very much its own movie while accomplishing that trickiest of franchise gambits, bringing full and satisfying closure to the ongoing narrative while planting a couple of seeds for potential movies to come.|Fresh
It's an engrossing, forthright adventure.|Fresh
The effects are incredible, the action is exciting, the music is great, and Andy Serkis, once again embodying a non-human character through motion-capture technology, remains terrific.|Fresh
A clever, well-acted summer blockbuster which is an involving cross between a classic Western revenge and a war movie, dropping somewhere between The Searchers, Platoon and Watership Down, if that can be imagined.|Fresh
"If you already find yourself on the side of the ""Apes"" enthusiasts ... then ""War"" will likely be a mind-blowing experience, upping the ante via both its bleeding-edge visual effects and the grim self-seriousness of Reeves' approach."|Fresh
This is the kind of popcorn movie we deserve.|Fresh
A highly adult, political and dark cautionary tale, somehow disguised as a summer blockbuster.|Fresh
I'm going to end this review on some sort of hyperbolic pull quote that will look good on Twitter and/or RottenTomatoes that can be used in the film's marketing.|Fresh
An intense thriller examining mercy, human nature and the price of vengeance.|Fresh
Much of the two-plus hours finds Reeves feigning character development with drawn-out close-ups that register as little more than an ostentatious showcase for the peerless visual effects.|Rotten
Seamlessly blending human actors with CGI creatures and a wealth of visual effected violence, the film delivers awe-inspiring action. So why was I so bored?|Rotten
"It's actually heartening to know that ""summer blockbuster""-type movies like this can still be made."|Fresh
Andy Serkis may actually get that Oscar nomination this time out...|Fresh
WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is what a big summer movie should be - beautifully crafted, visceral, exciting, but also filled with substance.|Fresh
Not only one of the smartest movies of the year, it's possibly the best film of the summer.|Fresh
Exceptional filmmaking, and the culmination of everything we've seen so far. Andy Serkis is masterful.|Fresh
"Far as this year's downer franchise entries go, it's far less smug and more deeply-felt than ""Logan."""|Fresh
A dark and breathtaking film. Director Matt Reeves has crafted one of the defining war movies of our time|Fresh
The psychological wars that have made the prequels simmer with tightly wound tensions are given their most cutting treatment yet.|Fresh
