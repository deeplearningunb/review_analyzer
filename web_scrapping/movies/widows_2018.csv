Widows is a film that has it all - a smart script, driving crime thriller energy, memorable characters and something to say about the world we live in.|Fresh

Never afraid to sink her teeth into a role, Davis crafts a tough-as-nails exterior for Veronica, snarling insults at the other women while trying to mask the creeping sense of dread that continues to mount as the deadline draws near.|Fresh
Davis' stoicism has been her stock in trade for years. That whip-smart personality of forceful vengeance makes her the ideal woman to head this stellar cast of actors.|Fresh

An authentic portent of the audiovisual narrative that combines an enviable cinematographic medium and language and a unique discursive power. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The acting on all points is phenomenal and Davis' acting reaches through the screen and grabs you. From displaying purejoy and love to screaming in grief...Veronica is a woman who shows every side of herself.|Fresh
There's nothing more powerful in Widows than the small, wordless moments between characters - and how they communicate so much by saying nothing at all.|Fresh
People will be talking about Widows for years to come.|Fresh
[It's] a compelling narrative, keeping the original's basic premise, but transporting it to contemporary Chicago while superbly bringing the myriad characters together.|Fresh
This movie might move a little slowly, but the ending is worth it.|Fresh
There can be power in kindness and in camaraderie alongside crime and corruption, and that is the nuance, the depth, and the politics Widows provides.|Fresh
A compelling story of how power is imbalanced - whether by class, gender, or race - that always remembers to excite and entertain.|Fresh
Now, with his fourth film McQueen turns in another 180 type maneuver. Widows sees three women, who are all left widows when their criminal husbands are killed, with nothing in common coming together to do something no one would have expected of them.|Fresh
Widows benefits from the organized structure of its storytelling and the ability to never slackening in tension or emotion.|Fresh
Widows is exactly what you had hoped Ocean's 8 would've been, except with a much more dramatic tone. I think this film was able to showcase a group of women in a more practical way by allowing them to be both vulnerable and strong at the same time.|Fresh
Blends character driven dynamics with an intense atmosphere to make for an engrossing, stakes filled watch.|Fresh
A slick thriller with much to show, just as much to say and plenty of grim, purposeful swagger.|Fresh
Widows is much more than your typical heist drama. It turns the genre on its head with its thoughtfulness, character building and twists you certainly never expected.|Fresh
It would be wrong to place all the credit on the script when every element of Widows expresses character and theme with intelligence and concision.|Fresh
It is a slow character study that didn't really tell us anything about the characters in the film.|Rotten
Movie fans looking for a film celebrating women onscreen that doesn't use femininity, whatever that is, as a crutch, should flock to Widows. It fits the bill.|Fresh
Widows may appear to be dressed for a funeral, but peel back the layers and more shall be revealed.|Fresh
It might masquerade as a heist film about a group of widows pulling off a job after their husbands are all killed in a robbery-gone-wrong, but this is a steely-eyed interrogation of a city: Chicago.|Fresh
Somersaulting over crowd-pleasing heist bits to explore character is a dicey move, but McQueen and Flynn manage to accommodate our desire for a good yarn as well as manage genre expectations...|Fresh
This is an intense film with a plot like a snake; who survives and who gets bitten depends on where the next twist turns.|Fresh
Crime thriller with one of the best performances of 2018. McQueen directs an effective female lead cast with a chemistry rarely seen in modern cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Viudas no está absuelta de personajes planos y un desenlace que queda debiendo, pero la película demuestra que McQueen está la altura incluso cuando se trata de un género al cual es relativamente nuevo.|Fresh
Widows has McQueen's depth, all the while bringing Flynn's pulpiness.|Fresh
After all the pointless plot twists, gross overacting, and irritating visuals, all that's left is a jumbled, disappointing mess of bloody brutality.|Rotten
"""A conventional heist-movie in the times of the MeToo""."|Fresh
Whittling the miniseries' 290 minutes down to the movie's 130 minutes couldn't have been easy, but what remains is compact enough not to wear out its welcome yet expansive enough to give all of the major characters plenty of breathing room.|Fresh
Exquisitely made and acted though at times, even as a fan of the slow burn approach, I longer for the pace to push along a bit faster.|Fresh
Widows... rewards audiences willing to let themselves be pulled into an interwoven tale of crime and corruption, race and class, politics and prejudice.|Fresh
Widows is exactly what you had hoped Ocean's 8 would've been, except with a much more dramatic tone.|Fresh
Quick splashes of violence and a few cool twists will catch audiences off-guard.|Fresh
This thing doesn't have the luxury of time; it can't develop the characters or complexity it needs.|Rotten
The widows' journey is spearheaded by the always-brilliant Viola Davis as a character who is quite buttoned-up with all kinds of depth just beneath the surface, doesn't hurt at all.|Fresh
The noir of the year.|Fresh
[A] cerebral popcorn flick with an inherent cunning messaging about shifty womanhood pushed to the legal limit, Widows is dashing entertainment. The incomparable Viola Davis is its strong, shining centerpiece|Fresh
The film is an elegant and well written thriller. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
...it has a lot to say about the American mentality, and the way they are broken as a society. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With the help of a delicious script expertly executed by a coterie of her talented co-stars, the incomparable Ms. Davis steals the show and delivers yet another Oscar-quality performance. Vintage Viola!|Fresh
There's nothing here that won't make you glad you came.|Fresh
The twists and turns in Widows' plot are deeply satisfying, but it's not simply the film's clever construction that makes it so compelling; it's McQueen and Flynn's willingness to give a heist film depth and resonance.|Fresh
What comes out here is... [the] effortless calligraphy of an intelligent but dispassionate schoolboy. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Steve McQueen has made a movie for multiplexes without sacrificing any of his individuality or greatness as a filmmaker. This is one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
The thrilling, emotional Widows is so satisfying because it not only does not skimp on the stuff that makes heist movies tick, it ups the ante.|Fresh
Less acrid and confrontational than his past work, Widows  finds McQueen working in the kind of broadly populist filmmaking spectrum as someone like Michael Mann[.]|Fresh
Very much in the style of Lumet and Pollack, with a dash of Michael Mann's Heat, the film swings big and mainly connects; it excels in characterizations, and only stumbles when confronted with straight-up genre elements.|Fresh
On issues of race, politics, gentrification, gender roles, and relationships, it seems to have plenty to say. More often than not, it says it smartly and without bashing you over the head with its ideas.|Fresh
It is an exercise in style and genre that provokes emotion and maintains attention, but still maintains itself in form. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is a narrative that discusses Black Lives Matter, sexism, interracial marriage and feminism, and still manages to be the most fun theater-going experience of the year. It's exactly the kind of studio movie audiences should want.|Fresh
This is a smarter breed of a crime movie.|Fresh
A heist thriller built around empowering women and condemning the American political machine shouldn't work, but this movie does.|Fresh
Steve McQueen makes no concessions. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Rendered with real pace and power, the film weaves sexual, racial and social politics into a gripping, muscular story.|Fresh
It's complex, and enjoyable, although not exactly moral...there are a sufficient amount of twists that keep you guessing in a fun way.|Fresh
As always, Davis commands and rewards a viewer's attention. Steve McQueen has superbly reinterpreted the cookie-cutter heist genre as an absorbing drama.|Fresh
A mixture of elements and an interesting hybrid of genres, it is also at a middle point that separates it from normality, but it still places it far from reaching the extraordinary. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film's sense of its own importance also proves to be its undoing.|Rotten
What is really great, aside from original and brilliant, is the way in which the director plays with expectations to then dismantle them all. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film is entertaining and I suspect a new genre is born and the weapons have changed hands. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's hardly the pulse-pounding thriller suggested by its trailers.|Rotten
Widows is cluttered and lumbering, with only occasional moments of transcendence.|Rotten
They're definitely touching on a lot of themes, and not just on the Black experience and feminism...|Fresh
This is really good. It's also the total opposite of what the trailer says.|Fresh
It won't get the awards attention of 12 Years a Slave, but it should.|Fresh
Viola Davis thrills in this taut ride that doesn't stick to genre convention.|Fresh
...the movie remains unable to accumulate any real momentum or sense of escalation...|Rotten
Shooting for a study of corruption almost of the level of The Godfather, but so damn modern, this is obviously one of the key movies of 2018 and another McQueen saga guaranteed to provoke heated debate.|Fresh
This Steve McQueen film follows many of the conventions of the heist film, but stands out for its transgressions. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
They left a lot up to the viewer's imagination...at this large a scale, they could have honed it in a little more. But the cinematography in this movie is amazing.|Fresh
In my top three of the year for sure. Viola Davis deserves a nomination.|Fresh
An intense, complex, and exhilarating thriller that takes a chance with women as the lead.|Fresh
Widows is the marriage of Flynn's instinct for the twist and the strong female lead, with McQueen's flair for the frame and visual metaphor. It has produced one of the strongest films of 2018.|Fresh
Davis' powerhouse presence is complemented by Rodriguez and Debicki (in a starmaking turn), plus an equally powerhouse supporting cast.|Fresh
"""Widows"" is a gritty heist movie and a story of female empowerment."|Fresh
Beneath its basic premise [...] lie complex themes that branch out towards social, economical, cultural, and racial divides.|Fresh
When the widows come knocking - masked and armed - the right thing to do is to roll out the carpet that leads to the safe.|Fresh
This is a rich story with detailed characters who fit into a broader social context. There are also some surprising twists. This is a good heist movie, but it is a lot more than that.|Fresh
McQueen's Widows is thrilling, empowering, shocking and disturbing all at the same time, but in all the right ways.|Fresh
Widows, in the hands of Michael Bay would have been a fast-paced action film, and not much more. McQueen... gives another twist to the story. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[Widows] includes fewer action scenes than you would expect... But Widows not only explores issues of gender and race, it also talks about family fractures and religion and corrupt politicians. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's some melodrama - it's a satisfyingly pulpy movie - but that doesn't totally undercut the emotion.|Fresh
That essential jolt of satisfaction is missing.|Rotten
What's brilliant about Widows is how easily it makes you empathise with the characters.|Fresh
They throw several kitchen sinks into the works, but forget to add the fun.|Rotten
With its themes of political corruption and large-scale criminal activity, Widows is effortlessly transformed into an American setting.|Fresh
Widows is a blockbuster full of ideas, and McQueen (along with cowriter Gillian Flynn) unpacks them with clever staging and camera work.|Fresh
Despite some predictability in the portrait of political corruption, [McQueen] achieves several powerful and disturbing scenes, and sustains the route of intrigue in the solid performances. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
When the obligatory twists begin to unfold, not to mention an ending that feels like a cross between wish-fulfillment and something a bit too cleverly elliptical.|Fresh
Widows is definitely worth your money at the box office. Much of the dark crime thriller features supremely talented women making money moves, and if you have a problem with that, well... this one ain't for you!|Fresh
There are many moments when Widows spills over into melodrama, but it remains wholly captivating throughout and is ably carried forward by a stunning cast doing spectacular work.|Fresh
McQueen's latest may not be as singular a success as his previous efforts, but what it manages to do with its tremendously ambitious vision is to create a brilliantly imperfect heist drama.|Fresh
"The political and social climate of Chicago sneaks into the lives of the characters', creating depth along their journey. You will be rewarded at every turn of ""Widows."""|Fresh
Thanks to some extremely well-staged action sequences and tight, serious direction by Steve McQueen, Widows delivers a top-shelf, twist-filled femme-noir crime thriller spiced by the ignition of toxic masculinity and toxic femininity colliding.|Fresh
It's rare to come across a film that is both brilliant and brilliantly entertaining.|Fresh
Steve McQueen makes his first foray into thriller territory with Widows, a screen adaptation of Linda LaPlante's 1980s mini-series|Fresh
Widows is such a special movie because it's so much more than the standard heist film.|Fresh
If the filmmakers appear to take a cynical or pessimistic approach to American politics, they offer redemption in the spectacle of a disparate group of women working together to achieve an apparently impossible goal.|Fresh
More fleshed-out, more real-world weighty than your standard popcorn caper, and it's a rush seeing these women take matters into their own felonious hands.|Fresh
It is largely Viola Davis's show, and she up for the heavy lifting of a heroine who deftly juggles grief, anger and survival instincts with dazzling confidence.|Fresh
[Widows] is a hybrid, a mixture, a pendulum constant between the feminine drama and the genre film that offers more findings than lacks. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The dialogue is strong and signature Gillian Flynn.|Fresh
That's kind of incredible in a genre film, to get such a complicated cross-section of a place in one marvelously efficient thriller.|Fresh
Cowritten by McQueen and Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl) and anchored by Davis' commanding lead performance, Widows functions on one level as a feminist revamp of the heist genre.|Fresh
Should you make the mistake of missing Widows, and you will be depriving yourself if one of the most memorable films of this year.|Fresh
...loaded with violence, mostly emotional, but physical, too. The acting is outstanding.|Fresh
Like Carmela Soprano, these widows were happy to live in bourgeois comfort on dirty money. When the easy living ends, they demonstrate they've got enough moxie and resourcefulness to get out of trouble. So what? It's quite watchable though.|Fresh
There is a huge plot twist...when it comes it feels like something out of a trashy soap opera... Am I watching a telenovela?|Rotten
Steve McQueen comes in with all these heavy-handed messages... the movie is bloated with these issues.|Rotten
Widows benefits significantly from a very strong script that is rich in theme and character and features sharp and surprisingly funny dialogue.|Fresh
Every second of Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn's thriller owns.|Fresh
Widows is the rare film I wish was longer.|Fresh
One twist too many hobbles compelling crime drama.|Fresh
This might be the deepest ensemble of any film of the year, giving each character a standout moment that makes you hold your breath. No one stands out more than Viola Davis.|Fresh
Given McQueen's appreciation for a locked-off shot, he could have just trained his camera on this lot eating lunch for two hours, sent the unbroken take to cinemas and driven straight to the SAG Awards to watch them collect the prize for Best Ensemble.|Fresh
Widows is not just the best female-led movie we've seen in years; it's the best heist movie we've seen in years, that just happens to star women.|Fresh
Ultimately, the performances were good, the character development was good, [but] I feel like they could have fleshed out some of the characters a little more.|Fresh
Raw, brutal, compelling, and heart-achingly sad.|Fresh
An ace thriller, presenting the business of desperate amateurs assembling a dangerous heist with a burly, growling nastiness.|Fresh
"With a little more of that opening scene craziness - and a bit less of the gratuitous content - ""Widows"" might fall into more of a guilty pleasure category."|Fresh
A jagged-edged thriller with sharp cuts on politics, class, glass ceilings and race. In these layers, everyone recognizes just how rigged the system is, so there's no use in fighting fair.|Fresh
By giving Rodriguez, Davis, Debicki and Erivo characters worthy of their talents, McQueen has made one of the most vital films of the year.|Fresh
McQueen and Flynn are masters at work. Rich, powerful and enthralling.|Fresh
McQueen creates a tightly wound thriller which defies genre norms, and puts a spin on a formula utilized frequently. Reminding audiences that we must embrace these scarcely made character driven pictures when given to us.|Fresh
Widows is...a fusion of low and high film that operates with assured craftsmanship and is very much itself. This is one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
So for as rewardingly complex as the plot is, weaving in a great number of issues making headlines today, the film as a whole just never really comes together.|Fresh
Women steal the show in this compelling, empowering crime caper that has more twists and turns than a corkscrew!|Fresh
Part popcorn thriller, part feminist statement, part political declaration, this is a pitch-perfect portrayal of 21st century America, warts and all.|Fresh
The female-driven thriller features powerful performances by Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriquez, Elizabeth Debicki, and Cynthia Erivo. Steve McQueen delivers everything that was missing from the fluff piece Ocean's 8 primarily danger and suspense.|Fresh
A screenplay from McQueen and Gillian Flynn ('Gone Girl') crackles with twists, turns and even some pointed social relevance.|Fresh
McQueen wanted to direct a popular Hollywood caper and he has succeeded. I loved SHAME.|Fresh
[McQueen and Flynn] create a thrilling picture that offsets its one element of predictability with a compelling narrative that keeps everyone on their toes.|Fresh
Viola Davis leads a superb ensemble of women in a heist film with a social twist. Steve Mc Queen goes genre but keeps it very real for these times.|Fresh
... a richly textured crime yarn that combines familiar genre elements into a fresh and invigorating package.|Fresh
Widows wields an effeminate brawn and sly intelligence working to stoke a masterful slow burn.|Fresh
The best ensemble cast of the year live through Steve McQueen's Widows, an entertaining, intelligent, but altogether familiar rendition of the heist film.|Fresh
All the actresses are powerful, but Debicki's transformation as her character gains confidence is at the top of performances I've seen this year (including Viola Davis').|Fresh
Really there should be no delineation between 'important' movies and 'popcorn' movies, but there is, so take Widows as an example of how genre film benefits from letting artists play in the sandbox.|Fresh
The women in [Widows]have depth. They shift and transform, ... [they] aren't singularly labeled or monolithic.|Fresh
Widows is that rare genre movie that demands more -- more from its casting, more from its plot and more from its themes.|Fresh
"It may seem like the over-statement of the century, but you can put ""Widows"" in the same category of ""Heat"" and ""The Town,"" as one of the best heist movies ever made."|Fresh
From this point forward, there will be few excuses for a film that doesn't manage to stimulate the brain while also entertaining the masses.|Fresh
I liked the performances, I thought they were great. But the script they were working with was lackluster.|Rotten
McQueen's usual cinematic artistry is also missing, leading to a more generic looking film than expected, but the pulp factor is just right.|Fresh
A lot of this is due to the acting prowess...|Fresh
Besides car chases, gun slinging and violence, there's good deal of complexity and nuance for a heist film and that's ok by me.|Fresh
A cast this stacked can't help but generate glory.|Fresh
Enough quality action and surprises to keep it interesting.|Fresh
Widows negotiates the genre's perilous twists and turns so masterfully that it should be considered a frontrunner for Best Picture at the Oscars. It's that good.|Fresh
"Other reviewers talk about the film's style and originality, but I found no evidence of either (unless you consider endless shots of reflections in mirrors and glass store windows ""style"")."|Rotten
Widows is filled with wild beauty, heart-thumping grotesquerie and even some good ol' soapy treachery.|Fresh
The movie isn't interested in being about women, or even womanhood, so much as the specific women we watch mature from partners of convenience into true equals. And yet these people aren't a mere substitute for an archetypal male character.|Fresh
A thriller in name only... strong acting and character work, but unfocused and overly mired in theme.|Rotten
What it lacks in sense it makes up for with style. Davis, Debicki and Rodriguez are wives-turned-thieves, and they are marvelous to behold.|Fresh
Davis is superb as Veronica. Her grief is palpable. Her pain is omnipresent.|Fresh
It's a consistently surprising, twisty, (female-) character-driven drama.|Fresh
'Widows' is a good movie, if not a great one, with an excellent cast. Incidentally, my wife and daughter saw all the movie's story twists and reveals coming a mile away. I did not. Is that evidence of female intuition? Perhaps.|Fresh
A dark, convoluted tale of crime, corruption, and abuse that's really too overstuffed for its own good but bolstered by a committed cast.|Fresh
Widows is a good thriller that seems like it could have been great.|Fresh
It's not Heat, it's better.|Fresh
The kind of high quality studio fare adults have been begging for in the age of the big blockbuster. It's whip smart, flawlessly directed, and ferociously acted.|Fresh
The film's greatest strength is the character development... everyone has a cunningly explained motive, and the tenuous relationships are constantly threatening to unravel.|Fresh
McQueen's film feels hijacked by Flynn's ablutions, sapping it of sustaining power. There's still plenty to like here: The keen performances work seamlessly with the director's audacious filmmaking which, as always, is a marvel.|Fresh
Widows is an overflowing plateful of entertainment, piled high with juicy plot, buttery performances, and plenty of sweet genre pie. It's a mash-up of pulp and prestige that shouldn't work well on paper, but plays out tremendously well on-screen.|Fresh
Barely fresh. The trailer makes it look much better than it is. Great acting, muddled and drawn out plot. Loved Daniel Kaluuya's bad guy.|Fresh
If only more genre films respected their audience like Widows does.|Fresh
Spiking the story with issues of class, race, gender divides, corruption, police brutality and old-guard exclusivity, McQueen creates relevant social texture.|Fresh
Widows is a whirlwind of character revelations and transformations, and there is a gradual build-up to the climax through unexpected twists and turns.|Fresh
Widows may be a tough film, but maybe we're all a bit tougher nowadays. This film knows we are up for it.|Fresh
The story and its characters are engaging enough that you might just be captivated from start to finish. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sex, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
On top of being one hell of an action thriller, Widows is the kind of feminist film I've been craving. All the women in the film are standing up to an oppressive patriarchy, by whatever means necessary.|Fresh
"""Widows"" has such rich layers that it's easy to forget to mention the more traditional, enjoyable thriller elements. McQueen has fun with the details of planning a robbery as the women train on the details."|Fresh
Tries to be a lot of different things: heist thriller, feminist statement, social-issue diagnosis. That's a lot to bite off, and 129 minutes isn't enough time for proper chewing.|Rotten
I was hopeful that Steve McQueen could find the right balance as he moved to something more commercial. And there's no doubt that he succeeds here, but he doesn't give us another awards contender. It's a heist film with dramatic flourishes.|Fresh
Wait, Steve McQueen made a heist movie? A filmmaker so punishing you watch a little Lars von Trier to lighten the mood?|Fresh
[T]he plot branches out so much that the movie loses sight of what and whose story it's telling.|Rotten
A slow-burn, old-school heist film, that smartly focuses on its characters over action. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Steve McQueen's ""Widows"" is a heist movie with a pulse."|Fresh
The good and the bad co-exist with the ugly, and the result is a movie two parts fun, two parts not.|Rotten
[Widows has] enough stylistic flourish and character nuances to keep the audience engaged and entertain them through the familiar parts.|Fresh
This is raw, gritty, at times violent, and welcomingly complex.|Fresh
Ultimately overcomes its political digressions and gets the job done as a compelling, crowd-pleasing heist flick.|Fresh
Above-average crime drama has language, violence, sex.|Fresh
While I ultimately enjoyed Widows, there are more creative misses along the way than I expected from the creators who made it.|Fresh
Like McQueen's Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave, what stands out most about Widows is how the director takes a story that's often violent and despairing - and focused on social inequities - and makes it downright exhilarating.|Fresh
McQueen's artful slow-take style, in films like 12 Years a Slave and Hunger, would seem to make him an odd choice for the ticking-clock pace of a caper pic, but don't be fooled.|Fresh
"""Widows"" comes from writer Gillian Flynn (""Gone Girl"") and director Steve McQueen (""12 Years a Slave"") and a big part of the caper's fun is the tension between her pulpy, twisty sensibility and his slower-burning instincts."|Fresh
...works as a consideration of corruption on a larger, societal scale.|Fresh
[Widows] feel like a throwback -- an old-fashioned, intricately plotted crime thriller that's more about characters than explosions. Much like the heist scheme, though, the movie looks better on paper, ultimately, then it does in the execution.|Rotten
"The characters of ""Widows"" defy superficial judgement in the same way that director Steve McQueen's excellent direction defies genre. [Full Review in Spanish]"|Fresh
My first thought is, Geez, why did no one think to give Davis her own movie until now?|Fresh
Widows is ultimately a story of female empowerment, but, through its sensitive vision and careful technique, it never lets us forget the wounds that come with the victory.|Fresh
Simultaneously an affecting drama of self-discovery and hard-won female power, a vision of limitless civic corruption, and an incendiary, sometimes violent variation on the theme of carrying a torch.|Fresh
Because it spends more time with husbands and wives, mothers and daughters, and fathers and sons - families who deal with injustice as a calibrated normal - it rings truer than its contemporaries.|Fresh
Watching Davis' eyes, as Veronica tries to calculate her way out, is as exciting as the heist and its shattering aftermath.|Fresh
Widows is a gritty masterpiece seething with revenge, political cover-ups, and the struggles of modern womanhood. I'm already eager for this duo to team up again.|Fresh
An undeniably ambitious film but also an occasionally wobbly and uneven one that is at its best when it goes about being a straightforward heist thriller but which stumbles when it strains to add layers of unnecessary artistic pretense.|Fresh
Widows is a shameless crowd pleaser with just enough smarts to elevate it a bit above the ranks of mere guilty pleasure.|Fresh
Widows fires on all cylinders and there isn't a false step in the whole movie, which is pretty amazing considering it has more moving parts than a Swiss watch.|Fresh
Widows is methodical in its imagery and gracefully written; it's also a suspenseful blast, best seen with the biggest, most animated audience possible.|Fresh
There may be no honor amongst thieves, but at least one thing is true: Viola Davis knows a thing or two about getting away with murder.|Fresh
This is the most fun McQueen has ever been - not a high bar to clear, given his particular brand of misery porn - but that fun still comes with a bullet.|Fresh
The cinematic equivalent of a half-baked turducken.|Rotten
"Adults often complain there aren't good mainstream movies for them -- ones that can engage them, entertain them and leave them with something to chew on as they leave the theater. ""Widows"" is here waiting for you."|Fresh
...an entertaining thriller that grabs you from the start and puts you through the wringer. It may not be art, but it's rattling good entertainment.|Fresh
The success of a heist movie lies in whether you buy the twists and turns. In this case, it's an enjoyable ride, but some of the story's weaknesses make it less than it might have been.|Fresh
"Some movies are phonier than others. ""Widows"" is one of those. The always thin line between a twisty plot and a silly one gets crossed about an hour in."|Rotten
A fascinating and sometimes frustrating hybrid, a film that tries both to transcend and to exploit its genre.|Fresh
What could have been a throwaway thriller ends up as a smart and involving drama -- that's still completely thrilling.|Fresh
An embarrassment of riches in the casting.|Fresh
McQueen achieves his aim of using a genre framework to advance serious themes. That ambition, rather than the ordinariness of the central criminal enterprise, is what makes Widows an uncommonly good thriller.|Fresh
The premise is a borderline gimmick, but director Steve McQueen invests the movie with enough grit... to draw us in.|Fresh
These women aren't pining for the men they lost so much as they are just trying to get by, and in that vacuum, a powerful collaboration is born.|Fresh
There's no denying the power of that cast and the particular vision of McQueen, who turns Widows into something truly distinctive... if not necessarily effective.|Fresh
Widows marks Steve McQueen's first commercial effort, and if we're very, very lucky, it won't be his last. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Widows isn't just a great piece of twisty entertainment, but also one of the finest films of the year.|Fresh
"""Widows"" is an exquisite crime drama refreshed and relocated from the British 1983 limited series to the authentic socio-political quagmire of modern Chicago."|Fresh
Regrettably, Widows forgets that it is - first and foremost - supposed to be a believable heist flick.|Rotten
a fast paced political corruption/heist hybrid whose theme of women taking control of an environment where they have been undervalued and exploited by men is itself undervalued in service to a cheap, cliched thrill.|Rotten
McQueen has created a tense and satisfying action drama with a decidedly feminist bent.|Fresh
McQueen may have clinched himself a second Oscar nomination with his brilliant work at pulling this amazing cast together into such a compelling story.|Fresh
Widows is a valiant effort, but ultimately falls short.|Rotten
"""Widows"" brings to irresistible life the determination, and desperation, of four women struggling to control their own fate within a system built upon, and preoccupied by, its own greed, corruption, and indifference."|Fresh
Valiantly attempts to combine five or six different genres and doesn't quite succeed. That being said, McQueen can still compose a hell of a scene and this cast is phenomenal.|Rotten
The synergy between McQueen's rigorous formalism and [Gillian Flynn]'s salacious overtones feel strained at times, but the result is never boring... Underneath the dime store novel theatrics is a fascinating consideration of women under extreme duress.|Fresh
There are few actresses who could have pulled off this role with the intelligence, wit and determination Davis provides Veronica.|Fresh
"From its first moments, ""Widows"" signals that audiences aren't in for just another heist movie."|Fresh
Brainy and thrilling.|Fresh
For all its cynicism, the movie floats on a darkly exhilarating brand of escapism. It's one of the year's highlights in any genre.|Fresh
If all heist movies were like this, I'd never leave the multiplexes.|Fresh
"Powered by an understated performance by Viola Davis, ""Widows"" shows what can be done within the boundaries of the expected while delivering something unexpected."|Fresh
A crowd-pleasing violent urban heist drama that features tough women.|Fresh
The undercurrent of McQueen's focus is not who gets what bag of money but the grander thievery of gangsters aspiring to be politicians who themselves act like gangsters...|Fresh
A nifty, nimble marriage of prestige and pulp, this one packs a whole lot into a highly entertaining package.|Fresh
With a killer cast led by Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Michelle Rodriquez and Elizabeth Debicki, director Steve McQueen turns four women and a heist into the powerhouse thriller of the year. You're in for a hell of a ride.|Fresh
McQueen seems to be saying look again, look harder, because underneath the roiling tension of big money heists and the crunching of political gears is an examination about the ugly machinations of power, money and patriarchy.|Fresh
Leave it up to Steve McQueen to revitalize the heist movie in such a way that it moves beyond the shoot-'em-up, grand theft business to tell a story about Chicago's dirty politics, social and economic corruption, and moral ambiguity.|Fresh
As always, Steve McQueen is an original and bold storyteller, delivering the goods with dazzling creativity.|Fresh
"The ensemble is a blast. Everyone gets their moment and you come away feeling like you really got to know most of them, but it is Davis and her unforgettably searing intensity (and killer wardrobe) who owns ""Widows"" from start to finish."|Fresh
From the get-go, it's intense. It just draws you in.|Fresh
"The director of ""12 Years a Slave"" has lost little of his talent for moral shock, and the new film retains a clear-eyed vision of what has changed, and just how much has not, in the contesting of American power."|Fresh
Widows is one of those films that gets better and better the more you think about it.|Fresh
McQueen directs with a brutal ferocity, scenes often ending in ruthless bloodshed that's as well staged as it is chilling.|Fresh
It's rare to see a director of McQueen's pedigree working on a heist film, and even rarer for a popcorn flick to work on the intricate and stratifying levels that Widowsgrants us.|Fresh
It shouldn't seem this easy. To make a popcorn heist movie that also has something to say about society...that's a thin line to walk.|Fresh
This thoughtful, textured story - though brutal at times - stands as one of the clearest depictions of turmoil, racism and nepotism in local politics that's ever been drawn onscreen.|Fresh
"""Widows"" is an unimportant movie."|Rotten
It's a superbly crafted thriller that also happens to be as entertaining as any popcorn movie you'll see all year.|Fresh
Really a film about power ... and the compromises that accompany those transactions, be they political, professional or personal.|Fresh
McQueen's masterful film is the kind that works on multiple levels simultaneously-as pure pulp entertainment but also as a commentary on how often it feels like we have to take what we are owed or risk never getting it at all.|Fresh
With genuinely funny moments but twists in the plot and a tone closer to Hollywood standards, makes Widows a minor effort in McQueen's filmography, showing his more generic and even complacent side. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
McQueen doesn't reinvent the heist movie but rises the bar for future entries, while Viola Davis should be getting more award-polishing cream [Full review in Spanish in link]|Fresh
"After watching what filmmaker Steve McQueen does with the heist drama in ""Widows,"" give him free rein to take on whatever other tried-and-true (and somewhat rote) Hollywood genre he wants to transform into a piece of high art."|Fresh
"""Widows"" is a dark, gritty, and intensely captivating Hollywood heist thriller that is pulse-pounding fun."|Fresh
Violent and hard-hitting, the emotional timbre of Steve McQueen's heist movie is like a piercing scream.|Fresh
This is an adult blockbuster, laser-tooled to excite the audience.|Fresh
More often than not, the neatness of McQueen's rhetoric stifles the potential of the scenario.|Rotten
Those performances and McQueen's deft directorial handling of thrills mixed with larger themes makes sure this superior crime saga stands out from the crowd.|Fresh
Widows clearly has greater motivations than being just another crime flick, and McQueen's direction and thematic layering gives it an undeniably distinct flavour.|Fresh
Powerful and riveting, allowing McQueen to indulge his thriller sweet tooth while still making room for a sophisticated study of race, politics, and marriage.|Fresh
McQueen always uses film pretentiously. Widows belongs to his edgy genre of queasy art projects masquerading as movies.|Rotten
A heist movie that is gripping and badass, elegant and assured. You could ignore all the social-justice-warrior stuff and just enjoy this as a popcorn thriller. But what makes this so special is how it reexamines the genre's clichés.|Fresh
...started off looking like a crackerjack thriller ends up being merely alright...|Fresh
Recent Hollywood heist films - typified by the Ocean's franchise - have been largely concerned with shiny surfaces, gloss and froth but Steve McQueen is much more interested in what lies beneath in his gritty, gripping addition to the genre.|Fresh
Widows masterfully blends high-art craftsmanship with a sharply drawn pulpy narrative to deliver a crime flick that's equally smart and entertaining.|Fresh
You'll be hard pushed to find better this year. Wonderful stuff.|Fresh
So much of the film is about females trying to get on the same page regardless of their lifestyle choices, pushing the notion that if they can, well, they would become indomitable. Such a theme makes the closing shot unforgettable|Fresh
An Oscar winning director has reinvented a famous TV heist series and left me feeling robbed.|Rotten
This film goes beyond a simple heist. This is a testament to women breaking ground in new genres, especially women of color. Go see this film as soon as you can, preferably with a large audience.|Fresh
Widows is the best crime drama of the year. Director Steve McQueen and co-writer Gillian Flynn fire on all cylinders. The story, acting, and filmmaking are par excellence in the genre.|Fresh
"One of the best heist thrillers since ""Heist."""|Fresh
The end result is entertaining as hell: a defiantly feminist piece of art that questions why the default setting for commercial movie-making still favours male-led stories.|Fresh
Viola Davis leads the way with a hurricane performance and everything about Widows is pretty much sensational.|Fresh
A muscular thriller of the highest order that lacks none of the social awareness or political heft of past McQueen presentations.|Fresh
What makes a McQueen film so distinctive is that he does everything for real. There's nothing fake or polite about his style - he doesn't look away however ugly it gets.|Fresh
I can't recall the last time I left a cinema feeling so satisfied.|Fresh
It's a given that Davis is tremendous as the film's fierce linchpin but where Widows romps home is as a stunning ensemble piece, with Daniel Kaluuya's murderous mobster, Erivo's breakout turn and a revelatory Debicki.|Fresh
A bold, blazing film that positions complicated women firmly at the centre, yet finds time for little scenes which deal with the complexities of grief. McQueen weaves themes of power, class, sex, race, and politics; Widow-In-Chief Viola Davis is superb.|Fresh
Widows' stellar cast offers a refreshing take on old gangster/heist stories. Davis and Debicki are particularly stunning, even if the script does not convince you that an unholy alliance could form between their respective characters.|Fresh
Great acting, sharp visuals, but edited in such a confusing way that a second viewing might be needed.|Fresh
It's a film you can watch over and over, and get something different from it each time.|Fresh
So deftly has McQueen cut this diamond in front of our eyes, I was practically levitating with pleasure.|Fresh
Some of the plotting is a little clunky but the acting is wonderful, with Viola Davis on sparkling form as Harry's resourceful widow, Veronica.|Fresh
Although it felt bitty and disjointed at times it did keep coming back, thanks to some great characters, wonderful acting and some great plot work.|Fresh
A heist movie with serious bite, Widows is both brilliantly tense and strikingly relevant.|Fresh
With the help of a staggering ensemble cast, Steve McQueen has made an intelligent, emotional thriller...|Fresh
Heart-stopping action combined with heartbreaking drama.|Fresh
An empowering, electrifying thriller with an ensemble cast to die for.|Fresh
There are worse faults than cramming too much good stuff into an insufficiently enormous package.|Fresh
[Davis] seems unable to deliver substandard work and is here fabulously controlled as a grieving widow, a wannabe criminal, a heartbroken mother, an obsessive dog lover and a woman who will shoot you right through the chest if she has to. Great fun.|Fresh
In fact nothing much about Widows is credible, a fact that jars somewhat with its sententious mood. But it's so well made, that almost doesn't matter.|Fresh
The central story doesn't have enough room to breathe, and therefore never seems real. Still, you might enjoy suspending your disbelief.|Fresh
You don't know where it's going until it ends. Then you realise that, to become the masterwork it is, it couldn't have gone anywhere else.|Fresh
Successfully fusing two unlikely genres, it's both a traditional heist picture and a trenchant political and social commentary.​ (Broad Street Review)|Fresh
An accessible, slick, unashamedly commercial offering which delivers unexpected food for thought without neglecting genre-savvy twists, reveals and mounting suspense.|Fresh
Widows is a rare bird, indeed; a thriller of blockbuster scope with the artistry of a prestige drama.|Fresh
Widows  is superb. It's even better the second time around. A brilliant, edge-of-your-seat film. You couldn't ask for a better director or cast.|Fresh
This is not some faux-empowerment story dressed up in infantilising 'girl power' credo.|Fresh
Widows reinvigorates a story form with a new telling, modern context, and culturally relevant moments that prove the immediacy of these narratives, without pathologizing sisterhood to some terminal end.|Fresh
Widows manages to feel like old-school filmmaking but it is fantastically contemporary in its themes and refreshing female angle.|Fresh
These widows discover that they can work through their grief as long as there is a substantial will. Heh.|Fresh
McQueen shows he can make a big studio picture in a way that few other directors even attempt.|Fresh
It's a tough, taut, twisty thriller that never feels long despite its 130 minutes.|Fresh
To watch them coalesce into a hard-nosed crew of heisters is the year's most purely pleasurable piece of transformation.|Fresh
Steve McQueen makes this slice of high pulp a gloriously fun time at the movies.|Fresh
The black humour lightens the mood, or twists it, at every turn.|Fresh
McQueen deals with bereavement, race, gender and class at the same time as telling a riproaring story about a group of widows who need to get hold of a lot of money very quickly.|Fresh
Working with a cast which bear the weight of his scrutiny, McQueen's contemplative, soul-searching style is in evidence enough without detracting from genre thrills and feminist fury.|Fresh
A strong performance by a magnificent Viola Davis as Veronica Rawlins holds the churning plot together.|Fresh
A stunning and impressively ballsy thriller from McQueen, with a towering performance from Viola Davis.|Fresh
It is a film with a sledgehammer punch.|Fresh
McQueen's Widows feels urgent and contemporary, and - with a screenplay co-written by McQueen and Gillian Flynn of Sharp Objects and Gone Girl fame - the action and dialogue crackle along at a pace nothing short of electrifying.|Fresh
It proves that there's another McQueen who's always been bursting to get out - the same one whose industry secret is that he's always itched to make a James Bond movie, and now very possibly will.|Fresh
It's not a feel-good movie, it's a think-good movie.|Fresh
The film is taut, emotional, exciting and surprising and led by a performance from Davis so fierce and specific that you will want to see her make 20 more action movies.|Fresh
McQueen approaches the city to exercise a muscle that we did not know about and that, by the way, seems to have an enviable latent state. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Some of the plot points are preposterous, and the wrong villain seems to get his comeuppance in a rushed ending. Nevertheless, these are but minor gripes as McQueen heads into the multiplex.|Fresh
Widows truly gives Viola Davis the leading film venue worthy of her talents and gives female characters the space to play a dirty game. The story is very ambitious with its twists and turns, but McQueen rises to the occasion and executes with flare.|Fresh
You cannot say no to any trio that involves Davis, Debicki and Kaluuya, and so, no matter how perfunctory and predictable Widows can be at times, there is still a lot to be said about the people who make it work as well as it does.|Fresh
Neither having the time nor, surprisingly, the aptitude to build its story's tapestry of love, gender, class, race, crime, and politics.|Rotten
Yet the payoff for this slick production is no better than results you'd get from watching any ordinary crime-thriller. All-star cast goes through the motions leading up to a less than fulfilling ending. Passable, but most will expect better.|Rotten
The film never loses credibility, as McQueen manages to mesh explosive entertainment with realistic politics of gender and societal injustice.|Fresh
Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya is terrifying as Manning's brother and enforcer, Rodriguez is revealed to have unexplored dimensions.|Fresh
Widows is as thrilling - and as relevant - as it gets.|Fresh
Debicki's Alice gets the most to do after Davis (who utterly dominates this film, in the best and Viola Davis-y way) and I hope this is her big breakthrough.|Fresh
Captured with cruel beauty by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, Widows is another psychologically immersive and exhaustive piece from McQueen.|Fresh
Widows is a dark, gripping drama about women who were abused by the men in their lives and then left to fend for themselves|Fresh
A lean-and-mean action flick with one of the year's best ensemble casts.|Fresh
Widows showcases a directorial flair for balancing large ensembles ensnared in a plot-driven web, particularly since what unites all parties is McQueen's favorite subject matter: suffering.|Fresh
"Best-in-show honors follow the magnificent Daniel Kaluuya, who emits fear and panic in its physical form. Downright frightening in every frame, the Oscar-nominated actor of ""Get Out"" radiates, stealing every nook and cranny of the film in which he owns."|Fresh
One might... call it a throwback to a richer era of American studio movies, except that the story also feels attuned to a very contemporary anger, aimed at powerful men and the corrupt systems that sanction their abuses.|Fresh
The collective experience of witnessing a story like this unfold is the reason we go to the movies and sit through them side by side in the dark.|Fresh
Widows is hugely impressive, engaging and slick in a way that maintains McQueen's signature mature style without getting caught up in a tired, crime caper tradition.|Fresh
Widows is a heist movie with a mind and a voice and a total lack of fear in using both.|Fresh
Widows has a slow start but buffers out its screentime with an awesome finish.|Fresh
Widows' entertainment value is undeniable, and yet it's fascinating mostly as a case study of a supremely talented filmmaker test-driving his sensibility through a new and in some ways more constrained creative habitat.|Fresh
The thinking person's Ocean's 8.|Fresh
Widows has a commendable duality where it's able to be fun but not forgettable and exciting without being mindless fluff.|Fresh
It's a stark, violent, cynical but thoroughly entertaining caper picture.|Fresh
McQueen spitballs hot-button issues like political corruption, police brutality, domestic violence, sex work and even interracial relationships, but the punch is in the slick popcorn pleasure of watching these women pull off the heist.|Fresh
Despite the widows' common goal, they are not chummy. They are bound solely by need, so there's a grimness to their mission.|Fresh
It is both a McQueen drama and a McQueen experiment, and the balance between the two is almost flawless.|Fresh
For all its flaws, Widows is McQueen's most fascinating, bracing feature to date, a demonstration of the filmmaker embracing his commercial instincts instead of trying to pass them off as weighty and important.|Fresh
A flawed but fascinating mismatch between director and project, Widows is tough on crime, but even tougher on the causes of crime.|Fresh
A first-rate popcorn thriller.|Fresh
Led by a magnificent Viola Davis, the cast is ridiculously stacked. The action is tremendous. And the ultimate message is devastating in its swift brutality.|Fresh
In the end despite al formal solvency and highly enjoyable product onscreen, the artist who brought us Hunger (2008) is missed. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Even though Widows' critique of political skullduggery and male arrogance is pegged to a gimmicky plot device, it's still a rousing piece of entertainment.|Fresh
It's hard to make a heist movie these days that doesn't feel like the countless others we've had thrown at us going as far back as the days of the film noir... Steve McQueen has caught lightning in a bottle.|Fresh
Davis, who carries the picture in a way she has never quite done before, commands every scene with cold, ruthless efficiency; her gravity sells the story's preposterous premise to the characters as well as the audience.|Fresh
McQueen is in confident control of the material. It's such a thrill to see him at play with genre material and Widows glides like so few multiplex-packing thrillers do these days.|Fresh
With sociopolitical issues at the core of this thriller, Widowsis able to tackle many themes while planning a heist on top.|Fresh
Widows is rife with pertinent detail, doled out sharply by McQueen. He's not a subtle filmmaker, exactly, but his indicating has a gracefulness to it.|Fresh
It's a propulsive, artful genre work that finds something electric and unnerving in familiar material, elevating every moment with perfectly considered casting and a willingness to find unconventional choices and run with them.|Fresh
Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn team for Widows, an exciting, brilliantly-acted thriller about a team of desperate women pushed to desperate measures. A heist film with a lot more on its mind than meets the eye, Widows is a gem.|Fresh
This is precision entertainment, a crackling, pulse-pounding heist movie with a sterling cast, a whip-smart script, and undeniable social resonance, calling to mind heavyweight champs like The French Connection and Heat.|Fresh
It might not reach the heights of his previous three features, but the mad artistry McQueen brings to this film is something that is vastly missing in mainstream moviemaking.|Fresh
"Ultimately, ""Widows"" works as well as it does due to the way McQueen juggles substance with entertainment value to such eager subversive ends."|Fresh
An intelligent, entertaining drama...|Fresh
A stylish thriller and a good film and one that often has greatness in its grasp.|Fresh
An absorbing, sociologically loaded crime drama.|Fresh
It presents an enjoyably dark and sleazy vision of ordinary lives intertwining with the hurly-burly of street thuggery, local machine politics, and half a dozen other forms of daily corruption.|Fresh
