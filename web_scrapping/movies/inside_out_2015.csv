"""Inside Out"" was creative, insightful, beautiful and moving, but it was not hilarious; indeed, it might have benefited from a few fart jokes, because it did fall victim somewhat to its own impeccable taste."|Fresh
Inside Out is the family film of the year. It's funny, innovative and intelligent in bringing to life those voices in your head: joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust in 93 glorious minutes.|Fresh
The result is a visual delight and an animated marvel.|Fresh
A charming, vividly-imagined film with terrific comic timing. Its insights are sharp and its message accurate.|Fresh
Inside Out is a dazzling, creative film that will surely put [Peter] Docter and co. back in the Oscar race.|Fresh
Should you go see it? If you like Pixar movies, you'll like this one. It is beautifully rendered and rings true to a child's emotional life, and mine.|Fresh
By the end of this film you will be in love with Sadness.|Fresh
It strains, it scuffles, it barely keeps the ball in the air. Like a desperate, ageing clown, the studio that made Toy Story, Monsters, Inc and Wall-E seems painfully aware that it must come up with something ever more dazzling.|Rotten
It made me want to be a kid again. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
As funny as many children will find each of the voices inside Riley's head, both children and adults will come away mesmerized and filled with a sense of wonder of how our brain operates|Fresh
It's full of colour and lovable characters and held together by an immaculately polished screenplay that is every bit as funny as it is moving. It also features some of the best voice performances you'll hear all year.|Fresh
... it's a children's film that won't have to be viewed through a lens of nostalgia, but one that can be re-engaged with on an entirely new level as an adult.|Fresh
This is what Pixar is brilliant at: showing us animation with an emotionally honest story.|Fresh
Inside Out is outstanding. Astonishing. Sensational.|Fresh
The brilliance of Inside Out... is in the gentle, almost cheery way in which it celebrates sadness as a useful, hardworking, perfectly normal, and perfectly lovable aspect of how a girl grows up.|Fresh
It's rare to find media that's genuinely touching without being cloying. Yes, Inside Out is cute - but not distractingly so. Its laughs and tears are earned, in every frame.|Fresh
This is a story about, very simply, one girl's happiness. And it turns out, that can be an extraordinary thing.|Fresh
With originality, lively animation, and some powerful heart-strung moments, it will make you feel the same way as the five emotions in Riley's head, at least for a time (it's mostly Joy, though, by the end).|Fresh
What Pixar does is best is on full display here: create a completely unique, lived-in world with memorable characters, thanks to breathless pacing, snappy writing, and a lack of condescension.|Fresh
Niagara Falls, Frankie Angel.|Fresh

"""Inside Out"" does what Pixar does best: It stimulates adult minds stiffened with age and alerts them to the brilliant possibilities of everyday life."|Fresh
Inside Out, which is co-directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen, may be [Pixar's] most inventive film yet.|Fresh
Cartoon epistemology 101. Kids learn sadness is valid, and joy becomes sad too (bitter-sweetness). It's all good. 'Inside Out' is endearing, inventive, sensitive, and funny.|Fresh
Pixar has gone back to what it does best: Making characters you care about and want to stay with, who feel and act the way real people do.|Fresh
Aware of its own unrivalled mastery within animation filmmaking, Inside Out is a highly self-reflexive, daring and though-provoking feature, which provides a groundbreaking perspective on the narrative evolution within animation itself.|Fresh
It's nice to see a film that celebrates all the emotions, but still manages to be optimistic and uplifting. Inside Out is the full package, and will be one of the year's favourites.|Fresh
The movie is frequently adorable. But it's liable to create more than a few existential crises in viewers entirely unprepared to handle them.|Rotten
In the end we come to understand the essential role of sorrow in the human experience. It's a lesson seldom told in film - and never, in my estimation, with more grace and wit than here.|Fresh
This spirited movie is a tour de force in bringing enchanting form to abstract ideas.|Fresh
Inside Out is moving, quirky and silly and the writers seemed to have struck the perfect balance between cutesy and sombre in its storytelling.|Fresh
Beautifully animated, clever, funny and emotionally moving, their latest offering is extremely complicated yet deceptively simple.|Fresh
It's amongst the smartest, funniest, and saddest films in the studio's history.|Fresh
... a sharply insightful exploration of the complicated feelings of kids as a cartoon brainscan or an extended dream that turns the mind into an epic theme park ...|Fresh
"It's one of the most daunting and original ideas that Pixar has ever tackled, and they simply crushed it. Nothing but joy for ""Inside Out""."|Fresh

Pixar's best movie to date. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Pixar has returned with their fifteenth feature, Inside Out, and I am happy... to inform you that they have evidently regained their magic touch and then some. Not only is it their best movie in years, it is one of their best period.|Fresh
There's a great sense of invention to the way they've laid out the landscape of the mind here, and there are some sequences that are pure animation in a way that Pixar rarely gets to indulge in their features.|Fresh
In the first half of the film, I was being piloted by Confusion and Dissatisfaction. But by the end, Joy was very much in charge.|Fresh
[An] extraordinary and unprecedented film.|Fresh
Along comes Inside Out to remind us of the jaw-dropping conceptual flights of fancy the animation studio [Pixar] is capable of pulling off.|Fresh
Inside Out is designed and presented with the accustomed skill and invention that have been the hallmark of Pixar productions.|Fresh
I can't guarantee you will enjoy the same sweetly bonding experience with your own kids, and/or loved ones, but I can tell you with some certainty it will be one of the only films in the summer of 2015 that will even try to make the attempt.|Fresh
Pixar is back doing what they do best, creating some of the most bold, beautiful and ridiculously feelgood cinema you can imagine, Inside Out is an absolute triumph.|Fresh
Let Inside Out in, and it will wipe the floor with you.|Fresh
Disney Pixar takes a long walk down an infinite pier of personal identity in Inside Out, an animated tour of developmental psychology that captures the pain of growing up using primary colours and Amy Poehler's voice|Fresh
Who are Joy, Sadness and the rest but the studio's animators, writers and other artists, excavating memories, implanting ideas and otherwise getting inside the moviegoer's head, to work the control board of the viewer's emotions with uncanny efficiency?|Fresh
Inside Out is nothing short of a masterpiece, reaching new heights for Pixar and delivering a film that is a deep, intelligent, and beautiful triumph that can be enjoyed and appreciated by viewers of all ages.|Fresh
The most euphoric feel-bad movie of the summer.|Fresh
A dazzlingly inventive, brilliantly written and beautifully animated family comedy that's thought-provoking, laugh-out-loud funny and powerfully, profoundly moving.|Fresh
While Inside Out may not necessarily the most outright fun film Pixar has made, it is without a doubt the studio's best.|Fresh
Inside Out is as helpful as a session of therapy, and a lot more fun.|Fresh
A brilliantly visualized concept anchors Inside Out in a way that ensures it will resonate for years to come. Kudos to Pixar for again reminding us that animated entertainment can appeal to all ages and speak to universal truths.|Fresh
Pixar's not just back. They've returned with such incredible force it seems silly that we ever suggested they'd left.|Fresh
Say this for Disney-Pixar, it makes some pretty great entertainment out of processing formative experiences.|Fresh
Genius is an over-used and therefore devalued word, but Inside Out is what it looks like.|Fresh
Like Pixar's best movies -- Up, Toy Story and Wall-E -- this blazingly original coming-of-age story achieves greatness by refusing to talk down to audiences of any size.|Fresh
Given the subject matter, Inside Out is undoubtedly the bravest story that Disney-Pixar have ever tackled together.|Fresh
Overall, Inside Out is well worth seeing, offering up lots of food for thought.|Fresh
Your kids will probably enjoy the new Pixar film Inside Out. You may prefer to skip the 3-D premium ticket, take a nap and feed those little devils before you get them to the theater|Fresh
I'll add a message for Pixar's genius collective as a whole: Please don't stop stretching, reaching and pushing the boundaries of the art form.|Fresh
A charming mix of humor and heartbreak.|Fresh
I hope its real, quite sophisticated lesson -- that it's okay to feel things other than happiness sometimes, and that all our emotions help us grow up -- comes through all the bouncing marbles and glitter showers and rainbow pony princesses.|Fresh
With its quite literally cerebral bent, I think Inside Out might have some trouble fully connecting with younger kids, but grown-ups are likely to shed more than a few tears and give some knowing nods as this wistful little film plays out.|Fresh
Coming from Pixar, Inside Out has, by necessity, a more child-friendly premise. But that doesn't mean the film doesn't boast riches of complexity and nuance.|Fresh
Pixar's latest is an unmissable treat.|Fresh
"Like most PIXAR/Disney films, ""Inside Out"" is technically brilliant."|Fresh
A produção tematicamente mais ambiciosa da filmografia da Pixar.|Fresh
[Inside Out] will equally enchant children and the Jung at heart, with an increasingly rapid pace and trippy CGI imagery that allow no time for quasi-Broadway songs.|Fresh
There's little to complain about in a film that, despite its subject matter, plays out on the surface.|Fresh
[Offers] a strikingly intricate and satisfying conceptualisation of a pre-teen's psyche, complete with a goofball humour area, an imaginary boyfriend machine, a dream studio and a sorrowful visit to the subconscious.|Fresh
Inside Out is, along with Lars Von Trier's Melancholia, one of the most nuanced and elegant filmic depictions of depression I have ever seen. It's also, for my money, one of Pixar's finest films, if not their best.|Fresh
Pixar's distressing run of watchable yet far-from-exceptional pictures continues with Inside Out...|Fresh
Inside Out is most decidedly Pixar at its best.|Fresh
Ladies and gentlemen, normal service has resumed. With the release of Inside Out, Pixar Studios is once again making masterpieces. I repeat, normal service has resumed.|Fresh
Some of the complexity will probably be lost on younger viewers, but the story itself is entertaining enough to keep the kids' attention.|Fresh
Looks good only in comparison to its disappinting predecessors.|Rotten
The latest computer-animation feature from Disney Pixar, Inside Out is an epic journey across a fantastic landscape which also happens to be compellingly concerned with the quotidian experience of an 11-year-old girl.|Fresh

Poignant, heartfelt, and endearing, Pixar's latest outing challenges us all to dream, to feel, to be.|Fresh
What remains consistent in the film is the level of intellectual and emotional daring, as well as Pixar's ability to convert that into dynamic visual storytelling that will endure long after Joy and Sadness dolls are piled high in landfills.|Fresh
Inside Out is animated cinema's brainstorm of the year, possibly the decade.|Fresh
'Inside Out,' upside down or sideways, the latest from Pixar is great fun.|Fresh
Fittingly for a movie set inside someone's head, Pixar's 15th feature is a fireworks display of fizzing ideas and bursts of imagination.|Fresh
It is the universality of the film that makes it an instant classic. Inside Out combines simplicity with extraordinary formal daring and sophistication.|Fresh
The Pixar magic is back with a glorious look into the mind of a young girl. Gorgeous imagery, colorful situations and an emotional roller coaster reward any interested viewer.|Fresh
Just as the film itself balances humor and pathos, it suggests that true happiness is not a state of unblemished, perpetual joy, but rather a balance of all those emotions that make us human and therefore capable of love and affection and tenderness.|Fresh
"What's most brilliant about the luminously beautiful ""Inside Out,"" Pixar's best movie in a decade, is how director Pete Docter not only connects beautifully to those emotions but turns them into his characters."|Fresh
It's hard to say what the imagination maestros might be thinking up down their long road of animated development, but they've outdone themselves with the latest mega-hit Inside Out, another in a non-stop parade of successes.|Fresh

It's a powerful film that makes you feel all of the emotions you see on screen, and I challenge anyone to watch it without tearing up just a little bit.|Fresh

Remember how Pete Docter's Up made you feel sad and happy at the same time? Docter's new movie, Inside Out, does that, too.|Fresh
"The most pleasurably complete Pixar film since 2004's The Incredibles, Inside Out delivers a witty and empathetic answer to the eternal lament of, ""What is going on inside your head?"""|Fresh
In this especially poignant entry in the Pixar catalog, humor, while not entirely absent, takes a backseat to a escalating crisis.|Fresh
Full of smiles and tears, much like childhood itself, Inside Out ticks so many boxes without ever feeling contrived.|Fresh
Who among the great filmmakers has put the workings of the human psyche front and center and made it so intellectually engrossing? Hitchcock? Bergman? Maybe, but I really can't remember laughing very much at Vertigo or Persona.|Fresh
It might not have the most original plot ever... but Docter's and Del Carmen's work takes the idea of emotions to a whole different level. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is clear in Inside Out that what matters is not the style, but the story and the way it's being told. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Inside Out is a masterpiece. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a brisk and effortlessly charming affair that explores some of our most basic human emotions and how they work together to make us whole people.|Fresh
The film's message is about psychological health. I imagine that quite a few psychology papers will be written about this movie. I don't know if the film's thesis is right, but it is interesting and entertaining.|Fresh
If you get tired of the ideas whizzing around you, you can just sit back and enjoy it as a pretty good Pixar animated comedy.|Fresh
Concerned with the complexities of human decisions, actions and motivations, it turns internal woes we're all familiar with into the stuff of grand drama.|Fresh
Inside Out is an exceptional film, even by Pixar's elevated standards.|Fresh
A mix of the brilliant and the basic -- a film that truly soars when it works, but doesn't quite work all of the time.|Fresh
Well, let's just say this light, playful and irrepressibly engaging animated adventure succeeds where so many heavy, serious and thematically complex live-action productions have failed.|Fresh
It's a complete experience, sophisticated on all fronts, most prominently the visual and emotional ones.|Fresh
Inside Out shows you how much fun it was being daddy's little monkey. It won't show you the power of those moments when you were a kid and you really let the gorilla out.|Fresh
I personally walked out knowing myself more. Some therapists have achieved less.|Fresh
A family film that's respectful to the intellect of kids while also being thoroughly entertaining for adults.|Fresh
One of Pixar's very best.|Fresh

A creative look at the way emotions operate in the mind of an 11-year-old girl|Fresh
Plenty of Pixar movies have the capacity to make people cry, but Inside Out is about *why* we cry.|Fresh
It isn't just a wonderful family entertainment, but a warm and creative embrace of the quirks that make us who we are day after day.|Fresh
In the immortal words of the great Mark Twain, reports of Pixar's death have been greatly exaggerated. ... Inside Out immediately establishes itself as one of the best animated films ever crafted by the studio.|Fresh
"It's the best possible reason for spending cash to spend emotions, as ""Inside Out"" gives you your money's worth with a story that entertainingly penetrates the mind to unleash the little kid that went MIA when you hit puberty."|Fresh
"I believe that its most significant contribution to pop culture will be as a lasting statement of opposition to facile, idiotic ""feelings"" as they're currently sold by movie studios, a chance for a moment of truth about loss, and grief, and even numbness."|Fresh
Usually those annoying 3D glasses are worth neither the hassle nor the surcharge, but in this case they saved my two children from noticing their normally stoic father blubbering like a newborn baby.|Fresh
Pixar's most existential picture yet.|Fresh
A conceptual near-masterpiece ... except for the big chunk in the middle where it isn't.|Fresh
The brain, science tell us, is one of the most complex things in all creation, and the movie's depiction of it is a thing of ingenious splendor, a mix of fantastically cartoonish sight gags and sublime comedic riffs.|Fresh
Inside Out lacks laugh out loud humor and its lazy animation is disheartening. Pixar films are known to pack an emotional punch and this doesn't have any of that. All it has to offer is a misguided heart that is visually displeasing.|Rotten
"""Inside Out"" is a fun-filled ride with plenty of jokes for kids and adults."|Fresh
It's all pretty heady stuff. Literally.|Fresh
I can't see another 2015 film topping its heart, emotion and complexity. You'll love it the first time, but it will prove even more enjoyable upon repeated viewings.|Fresh
Gloriously fulfilling.|Fresh
As terrific a technical achievement as Inside Out might be, it's an even better piece of writing.|Fresh
Pixar has now updated the mapping of our minds with a much broader palette, using the very latest technology and even consulting neuroscientists. The fanciful animated result is a combo of Oz-style quest and bright-hued PET scan.|Fresh
Considering how many Pixar films seem designed solely to trigger your tear ducts, it's fitting that the studio has finally made a film that is specifically about sadness.|Fresh
... The most ambitious Pixar feature to date ...|Fresh
I don't think I've ever seen a film that more powerfully portrays the fierce intelligence, but also the fragility, of a child's mind for moviegoing audiences.|Fresh
It's an unbelievably clever take on the adolescent mind and how it all works.|Fresh
"With a totally unique premise, a wealth of voice talent, and the usual attention to detail, ""Inside Out"" is a must for multiple viewings."|Fresh
It's all very Freudian, or Jungian, or whatever, and little kids may get lost, but there's real verve in the animation and wit in the byplay.|Fresh
The film's core message, about how sadness is as much a part of life as happiness, hits harder than anything we've seen from the studio to this point.|Fresh
Inside Out is an important reflection on the power of emotion - and proof that Pixar is still king of imaginative CG animated storytelling.|Fresh
This is a truly great film, a work of beauty and profundity whose computer-generated pixels come closer to human truth that most other live-action movies do. It's the best thing Pixar has ever produced.|Fresh
So there are some words on Inside Out. They're OK. I still don't think I got it right. I guess the only words I really need to write are: see this movie.|Fresh
'Inside Out' is a sad, emotionally loaded film that drains any initial exuberance like a faucet. Note to Pixar and Disney, please go back to making films that are more fun than not. I don't want to be bummed out watching a kid's film.|Rotten
"Inside Out is what a ""kids"" movie ought to be. And what adult can't relate to what happens to Riley? All of us have been there, maybe not that way, but there nonetheless."|Fresh
A little girl's emotions has so rarely been given the attention and care as Riley's in Pixar's newest film.|Fresh
"the film's MVP is [Richard] Kind, who brings the same ridiculous brand of pathos to Bing Bong as he did to ""A Serious Man's"" Uncle Arthur."|Fresh
After you realize the central message, which has to do with Sadness herself, the film feels a little like an exercise you'd experience at a good therapist's office. Only Pixar could pull that off and make a good, not great, film out of it.|Fresh
On the surface, this new animated film is clever and funny but deep down, it's much much more.|Fresh
An all-ages marvel...|Fresh
"""Inside Out"" deals maturely with depression and handles it in a complex and human manner."|Fresh
Inside Out is the best American-produced animated film we have seen in many summers and deserves to be recognized as such.|Fresh
Inside Out is the first psychological thriller that's fun for the whole family. Really psychological. And really fun.|Fresh
"In a summer full of superheroes and dinosaurs, ""Inside Out"" shows that living an ordinary life is the greatest adventure of all."|Fresh
You will even forgive Disney for Tomorrowland after seeing this one.|Fresh
This is a humane and heart-wrenchingly beautiful film from Docter; even measured alongside Pixar's numerous great pictures, it stands out as one of the studio's very best.|Fresh
Rising from the creative doldrums of sequelitis after the mediocrity of Cars 2 and the passable Monsters University, Pixar has hit a homer with a delightful, if message-heavy, tale about a little girl coping with a big move.|Fresh
Inside Out is imaginative and ambitious, even if it sometimes feels a bit manically overstuffed. And it's definitely a big step up from some recent Pixar films, such as Cars 2 and Monsters University.|Fresh
What's most cheering about the film -- and most like Pixar's celebrated classics -- is that it's so emotionally astute. You cry because it makes you happy, and you cry because it makes you sad, and you cry because it's all true.|Fresh
It speaks to the brilliance of Inside Out that many of the film's insights about the interplay of emotion only come to light upon later reflection.|Fresh
I both enjoyed and esteemed the latest Pixar installment. But I'm not ready to give away the farm, quiet yet.|Fresh
It's this last half of the movie -- when Riley learns that Fear and Sadness are all part of growing up, especially when they work alongside Joy -- that really connects.|Fresh
Inside Out's story is utterly unique. It's also a wondrous and magnificent film that celebrates the human experience and all of the smiles, warmth, laughter, tears, frustration, and despair that comes with it.|Fresh
"""Inside Out"" is a lovingly animated entertainment destined to work in different ways for different age groups, but it is that rare family feature that should inspire just about everyone to think."|Fresh
Welcome back, Pixar. We've missed you.|Fresh
It is exciting, hilarious, and deeply profound, making the most complex concepts accessible so we can all learn more about who we are and how we got that way.|Fresh
It's hard to think of anyone who won't be happy to have had this movie experience. And this is not a middle of the road, safe thing. So that is an enormous achievement.|Fresh
At times, you ache to put the brakes on the chaos, but still Pixar manages to do what it does best, turning the everyday rough and smooth of childhood experience into a thoughtful, inventive adventure.|Fresh
Inventive, imaginative and utterly original, it's a wonderful punch to the emotional solar plexus that will have you smiling through your tears, weeping with joy and embracing your sadness.|Fresh
Pixar aren't afraid to take its audience to darker territories either, and when they do, a simple story about moving house becomes an achingly moving farewell to childhood.|Fresh
Inside Out is a movie that will make you a better human being.|Fresh
Full of color and optimism, this is an extraordinary take on the human mind. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The pic works on multiple levels and will play well to all ages, although in different ways for each. (Full Content Review -- Scary Stuff, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)|Fresh
"What's most refreshing about ""Inside Out"" is its inversion of the standard prescriptions of big-budget animation: It's ultimately about the importance of embracing sadness."|Fresh
I don't think there's ever been a movie this wise and open-minded about what we choose to call negative emotions. There certainly hasn't been one so open-hearted.|Fresh
Inside Out isn't just a sign of renewed youth from Pixar. It's the reason Pixar exists.|Fresh
Not since Up, has the studio taken on the gnarliness of being human and made it so visually delightful and emotionally resonant.|Fresh
Co-writer/director Pete Docter's computer-animated film suggests greatness at the start and follows through on that promise.|Fresh
It's sad. Crushingly, relentlessly sad. And absolutely brilliant.|Fresh
Only in the medium of animation could a conceit as elaborate as Inside Out's be dramatized, and only animation this well-designed and executed could bring such a story so vibrantly to life.|Fresh
It's good to get your emotions in check before watching the exquisite Inside Out. You're bound to feel the whole bunch watching a child's mind come alive in the most imaginative ways.|Fresh
Brings back all the excitement and emotion of the golden age of animation created by Toy Story, WALL-E and Up, [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Docter and his team manage to create a sweet, hilarious and accurate portrait of the maturity and its greatest difficulty: emotional harmony. [full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's not unusual for a film about childhood loss to be this funny while it sets about the work of making you cry; it is unusual for it to be this much fun.|Fresh
Buddy films have always been about balancing opposite urges. Here the balance mirrors not only what's needed for great art, but also for mental and spiritual healing.|Fresh
