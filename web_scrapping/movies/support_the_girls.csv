An empathetic, sensitive (and funny!) portrait of female resilience and solidarity.|Fresh
Workplace dynamics have been one sided for centuries, but the tide has turned and won't ever be the same. Regina Hall in Support The Girls makes this workplace drama worth the ride|Fresh
the film ends with an uninspired, sappy tone that feels more overwrought than liberating.|Rotten
A perfect slice-of-life comedy with some of the best performances of the year.|Fresh
The eclectic supporting cast shines as well, creating the kind of chemistry found only between coworkers.|Fresh
The year's most generous film, it ends with a series of screams that express both frustration and determination -- an ideal cri de guerre for a new resistance.|Fresh
"There was perhaps no other movie this year that better lived up to Roger Ebert's assertion that one of the powers of cinema lay in its ability to be an ""empathy machine""."|Fresh
Hall is excellent...Richardson's performance as Maci [is] the best supporting performance of 2018...Bujalski's script and direction is skillful, yet the film's power is (rightly) in these actresses' excellent performances.|Fresh
Writer-director Andrew Bujalski has crafted an often hilarious and occasionally insightful film.|Fresh
Though Bujalski's aspirations are perhaps not that grand, it's easy to see [the film] as some sort of metaphor for what it's like to be a woman at this moment in history.|Fresh

Workplace dramedy has strong females, cursing, drinking.|Fresh
Like the manager she plays, Hall is a team player to the end. I'm not sure the ensemble cast doesn't overshadow her.|Fresh
Hall's hugely appealing performance has already been honored by the New York Film Critics Circle, and she fully inhabits a character whose mix of pride, professionalism, and protectiveness makes her a heroine.|Fresh
An amusing and heartfelt exercise in boots-on-the-ground feminism...|Fresh
A thematically rich dramady about three women who bond together in response to the humiliations at their workplace.|Fresh
Hall's performance holds together the film's slice-of-life observations.|Fresh
These are flawed characters doing the best they can with what they have. And as long as they refuse a narrow black or white focus, happiness will remain possible.|Fresh
The characters make this movie what it is.|Fresh
This realistic sense of female perseverance -- not supplication -- goes beyond prescribed political correctness.|Fresh
Writer/director Andrew Bujalski does something impossible with his newest comedy, Support The Girls: create something sweet and optimistic about American corporate misogyny and indifference.|Fresh
The rare movie about really important issues that also manages to be light on its feet and entertaining.|Fresh
"Regina Hall nails the role of her career in this darkly comic expose of the ""breastaurant"" experience."|Fresh
A rare film with a heart of gold and a fresh perspective on the lives of marginalized people, Support the Girls effortlessly but sincerely sways sympathies for the lives of those one would otherwise never consider.|Fresh
Coyote Ugly meets Clerks by way of Linklater and Lizzie Borden.|Fresh
Together they find solace, and to see that captured on a rooftop observing that same concrete cobweb that opens the film, warmed my heart.|Fresh
Everyone has a moment to make their mark, because this film is all about generosity. Thinking about the good of others, and acting in their best interests.|Fresh
Where Support The Girls surprises and moves is in its refusal to settle for an easy dichotomy between Lisa's idealism and the world's (and the work's) essential, inescapable bleakness.|Fresh
This is intimate, a meticulous character study, social commentary about real people in real situations.|Fresh
Support the Girls is a rare house-of-cards movie. Watch the first inadvertent nudge. See the whole thing tumble.|Fresh
A feel-good comedy firmly rooted in the Darwinian realities of the service industry, but much like its stubbornly optimistic protagonist, it knows to prevent the characters' dilemmas from slipping into miserabilism.|Fresh
"What a great movie! AUDIENCE, WHERE ARE YOU? Andrew Bujalski's masterly comedy ""Support the Girls,"" told across a single day, teems with empathy, wry humor and an uncommon awareness of the lives much of America lead despite jobs they hate."|Fresh
It's got America dead to rights in a way that's funny and doesn't preach.|Fresh
Support the Girls is a rollicking workplace comedy, timed to the fast pace of life.|Fresh
A pungent workplace comedy.|Fresh
Support the Girls may not be optimistic, but there is true catharsis in its grit.|Fresh
Support the Girls is about as good as movies about labour, power, and empathy for one's fellow worker get.|Fresh
...a less-than-ambitious misfire that feels long even at 90 minutes.|Rotten
It's sweet, but not syrupy; it's truthful, but not cynical. It's a breath of fresh air, accessible, and a real gem of American independent filmmaking...|Fresh
Bujalski has created something beautiful with bare-bones humility, humor and humanism.|Fresh
As much as this is a film about work, it is also, quite frankly, a film about the ways men unknowingly, without even really trying, make women's lives harder.|Fresh
It's easily one of the most humanistic and funny comedies of the summer, with a career best performance by Regina Hall.|Fresh
Like the joint at its center, the movie is somewhat untidy and rough around the edges, but Bujalski's affection for the characters comes through.|Fresh
"""Crushing"" is a good word at large for Support the Girls' approach to work, which as Bujalski sees it is equally tedious and necessary."|Fresh
You may never look at those Hooters waitresses quite the same way again. Heck, you might even feel a little bit sorry for them, realizing we -- the oglers -- just might be the bigger boobs.|Fresh
What makes this movie work besides Hall's performance are the supporting characters around her, primarily Haley Lu Richardson who is a little ball of sunshine that actively steals each second she's on screen.|Fresh
Hall is most impressive here; she truly spreads her wings her and gives a fully-rounded performance, touching and somewhat tragic, but fully lovable.|Fresh
It's got a very wry, affectionate sense of humor, and I found myself laughing at the stuff in recognition rather than laughing at them.|Fresh
It continuously upends expectations of where it will go, until it becomes a comedy of specific, deep empathy.|Fresh
Hall anchors it all, giving a performance that more than earns its place in the Working Class Heroine Hall of Fame.|Fresh
... a humorous and heartfelt comedy about sisterhood and blue-collar workplace camaraderie.|Fresh
It breathes comedy, rather than striving for it.|Fresh
Stealth feminism in a sexist sports bar.|Fresh
Hall assumes full ownership of this warm and funny film.|Fresh
[Bujalski's] found a sly way to make his most political film, since he weaves current issues, like racial equity and illegal immigration, into the narrative without sapping the energy from the workplace comedy on the surface.|Fresh
The movie's hour and a half is over before you notice, so breezy it feels half-finished, yet it's that quality that makes it stick with you. These lives aren't over just because you've stopped watching them.|Fresh
Bujalksi wants a realism for each of his scenes that is, somewhat, attained but at the sacrifice of the plotting which feels messy, distanced and never fully gels into a coherent narrative.|Rotten
You come for the cheeky title and stay for the relevant, empathetic story about working-class women.|Fresh
A sometimes winning but fatally underwritten workplace comedy.|Rotten
"Herein lies the quiet magic of ""Support the Girls"" - the reason to see it, the reason that keeps it coming back from the recesses of this reviewer's psyche: Lisa is kind. That's the secret, the reason the film is a little diamond."|Fresh
There are lines in Bujalski's script that might have felt right at home with a laugh track, but he mostly directs his actors to toss them off in a casual, offhand way. He does the same with his politics...|Fresh
As the details gather, thickening the story, what seemed like drift is revealed as textured realism. Mr. Bujalski's touch is so light that it can be easy to miss what he's doing.|Fresh
[Hall] anchors the antics with mother-hen authority that doesn't disguise a bone-deep melancholy about how she ended up where she's at. She feels real, stuck in a situation that's a lot like real life.|Fresh
It's comical and just a little bit sad. Chronicling life's mundane, minor tragedies are Bujalski's stock in trade.|Fresh
As scrappy and noisy as it is - Southern rock blares away on the soundtrack - Support the Girls is a laid-back working-class movie that's ideal viewing on a summer Friday night.|Fresh
It's an experience that's relatable in some fashion to anyone who has worked for minimal wages at a service job, and the film derives its sly and unexpected power in the naturalistic way its presented.|Fresh
Remember how the indie-flick Paterson (2016) managed to elevate a lowly New Jersey poet/bus driver? Well, this tale of female empowerment pulls off a similar feat. Raw-edged cinema verite' cut to the bone, if that's your taste.|Fresh
Bujalski has utilized this business as a rich backdrop for one of the year's most unusual films: a day-in-the-life character portrait of a working woman of color that is frequently hilarious yet firmly rooted in its protagonist's undeniable melancholia.|Fresh
Lots of movies like to tell stories about grit, determination, and perseverance. Support the Girls understands, and even finds rueful humor in, the ways those things can still lead to a dead end.|Fresh
It's a soul-warming, endearing and entertaining piece of work.|Fresh
Support the Girls could have been a tragedy, a comedy, or a rallying cry, but in reality it's all of them at once.|Fresh
It's the take on the genre that Linklater might have made - sensitive, thoughtful and pointed, and willing to think about the kind of people who work at a restaurant where the food has considerably less appeal than the servers.|Fresh
While the film is a delight throughout, there may not be a better, more cathartic denouement in 2018.|Fresh
Full of funny, lovable performances.|Fresh
Support the Girls works well, not just because of Hall who helps bring dignity to what could very well be a very degrading world and job, but also because of the humor and heart sprinkled throughout the narrative.|Fresh
[It's] a thought-provoking, incisive look at sexual politics in the workplace that's as dramatic and heartfelt as it is funny.|Fresh
Andrew Bujalski's sharply observed workplace comedy gains gravitas from its basis in U.S. economic reality and from a terrifif Regina Hall.|Fresh
"Maybe it wouldn't be so confusing if what passed as the film's ""resolution"" involved something more than the antics of bratty anarchy. It's impossible to support the girls on such shaky ground."|Rotten
A bit too airless at times, more valuable as a study of marvelous acting than an offering of captivating storytelling.|Fresh
Its light, sweetly frisky exterior and easygoing pace camouflages what a subtle and brilliant piece of bracing social commentary it is; a deft portrait of sisterhood existing under the thumb of capitalistic patriarchy.|Fresh
For the most part, a plotless story.|Rotten
A slightly shallow but charming and funny look at the girls who work at a Hooters-ish sports bar under the loving and watchful eye of their tireless manager.|Fresh
[Hall] brings a unifying strength and emotional substance to a movie with a scruffy-charm comic tone and rambling episodic structure.|Fresh
Support the Girls invites questions about why it exists and whether it offers an experience worth the price of admission and the investment of time.|Rotten
Support the Girls quickly evolves into a bittersweetly uplifting celebration of got-your-back, we-will-survive sisterhood.|Fresh
To see a black female over 40 holding the center of a story about ordinary, unsung lives makes Support a low-key pleasure; one that transcends its own shaggy narrative.|Fresh
"His latest features one of his largest ensembles with a career best performance from Regina Hall and Haley Lu Richardson doing a complete about face from last year's ""Columbus"""|Fresh
Hall's superb, deeply felt performance keeps the movie grounded, allowing the supporting cast to provide hilarious liftoff at regular intervals.|Fresh
I just love this movie.|Fresh
A gleefully unpretentious ode to the importance of respecting women.|Fresh
It's a curiously muted affair, with the large, artificial setups and phony plot hooks of a conventional studio comedy petering out into the disappointments and anti-climaxes of a mopey indie drama.|Rotten
Hall is this movie's center of gravity...she does a dance very familiar to working women.|Fresh
The film celebrates the unrecognized willpower and perseverance that undergirds low-wage service work in this country.|Fresh
Bujalski frames most of Support the Girls as an almost real-time delineation of chaos, but his storytelling elegance - delicate, nearly invisible foreshadowing; cogent evocations of backstory - adds reflective layers to the surface anarchy.|Fresh
Led by the stellar performances, Support the Girls may just be the comedy we need as summer gives way to fall.|Fresh
"""Support the Girls"" is an amiable, hopeful, day-in-the-life tale whose femme-centric cast feels like a family, and I guess that is the point."|Fresh
"Scruffy, lived-in working class comedy that makes the most of its ""breastaurant"" setting."|Fresh
It's so energetically acted and casually funny, you might not even notice that it never quite comes together.|Fresh
Despite the sizeable ensemble, this is really the Regina Hall show - and her exquisitely underplayed performance is the highlight of her career so far.|Fresh
The sharp-elbowed humor is laced with aching tenderness, tightrope-tense frustrations over money and love, and an underlying mix of social pathologies that bubbles through the show-biz surfaces...|Fresh
Who would have thought that such an effective working-class satire would also have some of the most clever body humor we've seen this year?|Fresh
An easygoing comedy that lives its politics instead of declaring them.|Fresh
It's a biting commentary on American labor and capitalism in the form of a mainstream crowd pleaser.|Fresh
A dude setting a feminist comedy in a sexy sports bar? Bold move. Titling it with a bra joke? Bolder. But writer/director Andrew Bujalski's new comedy, Support the Girls, does it.|Fresh
Hall's performance - tender, tough, empathetic, controlled - crumples from tears to laughter in a blink. It's phenomenal.|Fresh
Most of these episodes are funny; all of them feel genuine. Bujalski has an incredible ability to take situations that would be sitcomish in someone else's hands and make them feel genuine and character-driven.|Fresh
