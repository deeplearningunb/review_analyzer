The narrative lacks the dimension and insight to render the otherwise thinly-sketched characters as more than players in a well-meaning torture show built to generate somber outrage and not much else.|Rotten
Detroit is a gut-punch of a movie, one that pulls you in to the ugliness lying beneath the American id.|Fresh
An edge of your seat, white knuckle experience that will definitely invoke dialogue among viewers long after the final credits roll.|Fresh
"""Detroit"" is an exercise in ramping tension, with Bigelow's direction in particular pushing the audience past any kind of perceived breaking point."|Fresh
Bigelow never shies away from showing the true brutality of this crime, and it's uncomfortable viewing, particularly knowing it's based on fact.|Fresh
A provocative period drama that's not only captivating but eye opening with a tragically accurate yet profound statement about police criminality and social injustice.|Fresh
Detroit is a good film, and an important one, in that it illustrates with clarity and conviction what abuse of power looks like.|Fresh
Its stumbles don't fully take away the film's potency, but they certainly showcase its missed opportunities.|Rotten
Not only a tense and shocking drama, but also a multi-dimensional view of a historic event which gives it the attention and the scrutiny it deserves.|Fresh
Bigelow may have an Oscar contender here.|Fresh
Detroit reveals the stories we tell about ourselves and helps us face the myth of white innocence and the havoc it can wreak.|Fresh
Brazenly addresses the fractured relationship between disenfranchised minorities and compromised institutions that are supposed to protect and serve. Messy, timely and rightfully enraged, Bigelow's docudrama is eerily relevant.|Fresh
Look fam: there is something sadist in the obligation to give hours of your time over to something in the name of being seen as reasonable or fair, of being painstakingly careful with getting it right.|Rotten

It is a film that keeps the facts and scarcely tears the human content. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
The creepy thing is that although it is a docudrama, and actions are dramatized, the nightmare that was lived in the motel is true. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
But this is Bigelow's cinema: bold, intense and radical. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A movie like this needs to be handled with a sense of responsibility and care. I feel like Kathryn Bigelow did that.|Fresh
It is both The Battle of Algiers for America, & an incendiary chapter in a history still unfinished in our own era of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, & the Black Lives Matter movement that was triggered by their deaths at police hands.|Fresh
"This could just as well be called ""Baltimore,"" ""Ferguson"" or ""St. Paul,"" making this a film that is often hard to watch but which many may find necessary viewing."|Fresh
The cinematography (by Barry Ackroyd) - much of it hand held - feels both urgent and exhausting. It's as harrowing as documentary war footage and reminiscent of Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker.|Fresh
Detroit remains an unnerving illustration of a dark period in American history that deserves to be seen.|Fresh
A condemnation of police violence.|Fresh
In shining a light on a case without heroes, Detroit looks at the America of 50 years ago, and without needing to draw the obvious contemporary parallels, asks the question: Do we really want to go back there?|Fresh
A controversial portrait of racism and violence during the Detroit riots of 1967.|Fresh

"""Detroit"" is the rare film that scalds the heart and brain so intensely that the viewer immediately wants to talk with someone, anyone, about it. That may be its greatest power of all."|Fresh
The Algiers Motel incident is a f***** up, exceptional raw stretch of filmmaking, but in some ways, it consumes too much of the experience|Fresh
Detroit highlights an ugly moment in the city's history as the 1967 riots and one deadly night are revisited.|Fresh
Serves as both an immersive picture of history and a horrific cautionary tale.|Fresh
Detroit is vivid and it is demanding, designed to shake you out of complacency.|Fresh
Magnificent.|Fresh
The motel sequence is so suspenseful that it's a shame that what follows is so perfunctory.|Fresh
In one of the darkest moments I've experienced in a cinema for some time, I caught myself wondering whether the horror shown is so detailed, so unremitting, that white supremacists might actually enjoy watching it.|Rotten
However, this important but difficult film should nevertheless be seen, as much for what it tells us about 1967 as it does about the present-day.|Fresh
Far from being the biopic of a city, Detroit is at any rate a dark chapter in its history.|Fresh
Disturbing, provocative and timely - the parallels with the cases of police brutality and homicide that fuelled the Black Lives Matter campaign - this immersive dramatisation of events won't let us look away.|Fresh
It is of little importance that the harrowing true story depicted in Detroit happened 50 years ago.|Fresh
It's not an easy film to watch but Bigelow's control over every aspect ensures it's utterly convincing.|Fresh
I'm glad we have Detroit on the cinematic record, for future generations to revisit. I pray, by then, it will seem like a relic of the distant past.|Fresh
This is a film for smart people who are willing to engage with challenging, adult cinema to learn how dangerous it was for minorities in the 1960s and to become more aware of contemporary social conflicts.|Fresh
[Director Kathryn Bigelow's] forte doesn't serve this film's full ambition as a statement about American racism and a testimony of the suffering of its victims.|Rotten
If you want to have a nice time out at the movies, this is not a good idea; but if you believe in the adage that not knowing about history's mistakes dooms us to repeating them, this is an absolute must-see.|Fresh
Detroit isn't perfect. But you will never forget, or regret, that you have seen it. Bravo.|Fresh
Absolutely unmissable.|Fresh
I wouldn't be as nitpicky if it were directed by almost any other Hollywood filmmaker, but Bigelow has set a gold standard for us to judge her work by.|Fresh
While Detroit is very good at making you feel things, it's less good at telling a complete story. The film almost feels unfinished.|Rotten
We see that racism and misogyny go hand in hand in Bigelow's construction of hegemonic masculinity. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Detroit encourages its audiences to observe the oppressive power structures, suggesting that America is on a very long road towards a fully shared recognition of the need for change.|Fresh
The film is certain to divide opinion but, for me, what goes wrong is an over-slow pace, a rambling storyline that doesn't make enough sense and the presence of two British actors in this most American of stories.|Rotten
Bigelow's camera functions the same as in The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty; to scrutinize incidents with the soul of documentary reporting, seeking authenticity over beauty. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bigelow hits her country where it hurts. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Shot with a camera as nervous as the protagonists, [Detroit] generates a tension that is at moments unbearable. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

Kathryn Bigelow always seeks to put us in another's place, even if the result is particularly painful. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Instead of prompting me to consider the divide between two groups of people - or even the prejudices of a few particularly sinister police officers - Detroit had me thinking a lot more about notions of institutional power itself.|Fresh
Detroit, however, suggests [director Kathryn Bigelow] - and her current screenwriter - still can't quite tell the difference between an impactful film and an important one.|Rotten
Even a film like Detroit-centered on a moment from hell and the real story of the harrowing death of several young Black people-can make you feel more powerful because the film privileges the Black perspective and is unflinching about our reality.|Fresh
Detroit is a triumph when Bigelow documents a single night of horrors, but when she has to conjure up the souls of the men and women who awoke the next morning, the spirits of Detroit are silent.|Fresh
A new demonstration of Kathryn Bigelow's enormous talent, this time to take you directly to an emotional hell without ever thinking about the idea that he's manipulating you for it. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's nothing glossy about director Kathryn Bigelow's latest and viewers aren't spared any of the horrific details across the entire 140-minute run time.|Fresh
What might be most characteristic of Bigelow is the eerie feeling that the police are halfway 'acting out', performing their brutality.|Fresh
Although Detroit adheres as faithfully as possible to the facts, the framing of the trial can't help but feel clichéd and redundant.|Fresh
... the film leaves us shaken with its reminder that we can't just drift along hoping peace and equality happens by itself. Without stepping in to change the system, this will happen again and again.|Fresh
It's an ambitious start that's slowly-but-surely diminished by Boal's unfocused, padded-out screenplay...|Rotten
Tense, gripping, enraging, but only about things that black Americans already know. This is a primer about racism for white people, and we must pay attention.|Fresh
It is a harrowing, relentless and intensely angry movie. As it should be.|Fresh
Unfortunately, in Detroit she [director Kathryn Bigelow] delivers not characters but caricatures. . .|Fresh
It's an admirably worthy project, but not nearly as worthy of your time as it ought to be.|Fresh
Detroit [is] a film of great integrity, but hard to recommend to any but those hardy souls who can take their cinema like a punch to the gut.|Fresh
It feels like an opportunity wasted.|Rotten
As a wake-up call to a nation, it is tense, tough and terrifyingly timely.|Fresh
The fear-loaded, dehumanising, homicidal imperative dramatized here remains, the apparent recruiting qualification for large swathes of the American Law Enforcement Community.|Fresh
Bigelow's desire to highlight this still-too-relevant tale of police brutality and racism is admirable; however, there's a difference between commenting on horrific violence and merely shoving it under a spotlight.|Rotten
Once again, Hollywood uses history to show off liberal sanctimony, this time through a story set during Detroit's 1967 race riots.|Rotten
Beyond its (admittedly virtuoso) restaging of facts, Detroit falls short, a blunt instrument with little insight into the systemic causes behind the racism.|Rotten
An expansive, angry, somewhat ragged, but always engaging watch.|Fresh
Detroit becomes a kind of neo-Gothic horror story.|Fresh
Detroit tells such a powerful, visceral tale that it demands to be seen and discussed.|Fresh
It's a hard watch...but essential cinema.|Fresh
One of the most important films you'll see this year.|Fresh
Bigelow's latest is a harrowing and utterly gripping pressure cooker of a film that thrusts you into a nightmare from which many, sadly, are still unable to wake.|Fresh
Detroit comes out of its corner slugging and barely stops. By the end the viewer has a swollen eye, ringing ears and a conviction that the referee should have stopped the fight.|Fresh
Each actor inhabits their role with a precision and mettle that means even in the depths of confusion, the complex group dynamics are easy to read.|Fresh
Delivers a visceral punch to the gut that will leave you shaking with anger and frustration.|Fresh
It's nearly impossible to watch Detroit without making references to the climate between black communities and police forces that have been infected by institutional racism -- not only in 1967... but in 2017|Fresh
"In its own polemical way, it is very powerful filmmaking but, as storytelling, it is one-dimensional. There is too much ""docu"" here and not enough drama."|Rotten
Fascinating but deeply flawed.|Fresh
A film that will leave you feeling empty, cold and angry, tinged with a sadness that derives from the staggering pertinence of the themes explored - and while that doesn't exactly sound appealing, this is essential viewing.|Fresh
even if Detroit doesn't quite live up to expectations, it certainly succeeds in reminding us that some old wounds never quite heal and we desperately need to recognize why lest they infect the entire body politic forever|Fresh
Who knows whether there will ever be a time where the lives of black Americans seem like they actually matter, but it is the duty of filmmakers as formidable as Bigelow to keep reminding us they should.|Fresh
There might have been a way to make a thriller about police brutality... but it needed filmmakers more sensitive to what they were dealing with.|Rotten
Detroit [is] a fascinating reminder of a long-closed chapter of our nation's history.|Fresh
The interminable central act, dramatizing the events at the Algiers [Motel], overflows with impotent rage and horror.|Fresh
[Kathryn] Bigelow's use of her cast is impressive, even if limited screen time means that no one actor has what amounts to a starring role.|Fresh
Sordid and sadistic, it's filled with so much excessive violence that it induces revulsion, emerging as exploitative, racial torture pornography.|Rotten
The final movement of Detroit feels more like the work of an awards-grubber, and exposes [Bigelow's] general awkwardness with warmth.|Fresh
Bigelow's recent work is a cinema of big, difficult questions, but its cold treatment of trauma often leaves an empty impression, one that doesn't make the viewer understand or appreciate the moral implications of evil.|Rotten
Yes, the movie's harrowing middle hour is almost too excruciating to endure. It upsets viewers and sends them streaming for the exits because it's supposed to.|Fresh
Detroit is an important film for this moment in our country's history, and it's one that I'd recommend people see.|Fresh
The intense dramatic violence in that small motel annex felt claustrophobic. Bigelow knows how to make you feel everything.|Fresh
Bigelow is too talented a director to make a film this unsubtle. Detroit is a classic of example of: Just because you can do something, that doesn't mean you should.|Rotten
I don't hate Detroit; I simply can't recommend it.|Rotten
Despite a third act that doesn't really fit with the first two, there's a lot to like about Detroit, notably very strong performances by Smith and Poulter.|Fresh
If Detroit is consistent about anything, it's playacting; everybody in the film does it.|Rotten
It's a broccoli movie all right, and it put me through the wringer. The performances are powerful, especially by Algee Smith, Will Poulter and Anthony Mackie. It would be a lot less depressing if the racism it depicts was a thing of the past.|Fresh
At a time when tensions between the black community and police have been strained nearly to the breaking point, Detroit appears designed to accomplish little besides fanning the flames.|Rotten
An important film, engrossing and deeply upsetting. It simmers with vitality and immediacy, as any depiction of gross injustice and racial divide must.|Fresh
Despite solid performances from a brilliant cast, Detroit's take on the subject matter is inconsistent and confusing, glossing over motive to wallow in torture.|Rotten
This is an unnecessarily provocative account.|Rotten
For Black Americans, the events of Detroit '67 are not the events of a 'dramatic thriller.' They are the events of a tragedy and still-living history we know very well.|Rotten
Bigelow has once again established herself as one of the premier directors of her generation --- male or female.|Fresh
"""Detroit"" is Bigelow's powerfully told vision of yet another dark time in American history."|Fresh
Director Kathryn Bigelow's film about the 1967 riots in Detroit is a brilliantly mounted recount of an American tragedy. As you'd expect, it goes down like a pound of nails.|Fresh
The film has a documentary immediacy; Bigelow captures the hair-trigger intensity of this unbearably tense situation, via the restless, unsettling camerawork, the itchy framing and cutting, and the rich sound design.|Fresh
A film with a vital lesson that threatens to drown in over wrought sensationalism.|Rotten
A searing look at the impact of racial injustice.|Fresh
The event and its courtroom aftermath ring dismayingly familiar in the wake of more recent police shootings, but of course, that is the point of Detroit. Bigelow suggests we had our teachable moment a half-century ago.|Fresh
Bigelow brings Detroit home, showing how this historical scar on the American Dream deserves to be far more than an abhorrent footnote.|Fresh
It unsurprising that Detroit is the most important film of the movie summer.|Fresh
The movie makes no big pretensions - even in title - as it wades into the mayhem with a journalistic eye.|Fresh
The film leaves you with a deep sense of outrage that justice was never served and that on a certain level, little has changed in 50 years.|Fresh
Few films have lingered as long in my psyche. I'm still thinking about it -- and examining my reaction to it -- 10 days later.|Fresh
Detroit may be a form of justice for the people who suffered through that night at the Algiers Motel, but you know what they say about justice delayed.|Fresh
Detroit revisits the occurred to enlighten today's cinemagoers, though considering the state of reality, the film can be interpreted as a grim auguring if incendiary thought processes are left unchallenged.|Fresh
"""Detroit"" is a vital movie of our times and while it is far from perfect, it touches an exposed nerve we can no longer afford to ignore."|Fresh
Detroit is an important and thoughtful history reminder. And in these times of Black Lives Matter and videos of police killing black men, it feels sadly prescient.|Fresh
Its uneven approach over its three acts means it's not as powerful as it might have been. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh

Intense and provocative, it's a gripping and emotionally draining drama that is, by necessity, difficult to watch at times.|Fresh
A film which emotional power as a tool of social denunciation against prejudice and violence is irrefutable. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Detroit succumbs to problems endemic to ""Based on Real Events"" prestige properties, films that too often are preoccupied with the truth while not feeling entirely honest-the latter being what we should demand of art."|Rotten
America's history of racial violence and police abuse is shameful, but a great film on the subject should do more than merely reenact one notorious incident. I think we are owed something more. I wish Detroit provided that, but it doesn't|Rotten
Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Detroit is a powerful, intense and moving film that can also be maddening to watch.|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelo has made something horrifying, painful and rage-fueled in Detroit, but this focus on genre aspects undercuts a story meant for larger meanings in the end.|Rotten
As powerful a film as this year is likely to see.|Fresh
Essential drama about violent chapter in U.S. history.|Fresh

At times when you want to jump out of your seat and yell stop at the police. Brilliantly done work -- again -- by director Kathryn Bigelow.|Fresh
Narrative looseness aside, there is a great power to Detroit. Bigelow and Boal have put together a troubling portrait of a society tearing itself apart.|Fresh
Bigelow has a gift for conveying urgency and putting the audience in the middle of the action.|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal fail to find truth in the brutal Detroit, and gives us a missed opportunity for understanding.|Rotten
This is no one's neighborhood. Detroit doesn't help anyone to feel at home, least of all viewers.|Fresh
It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is. Detroit is a well-made and evocative film that is also numbingly brutal with little to no reprieve.|Fresh
It's said you can never make an anti-war movie, that some of the thrill of battle will leak in to even the most pacifistic film. Give Bigelow credit -- this certainly isn't an anti-rebellion movie.|Fresh
Bigelow and Boal want to make a moral howl of a movie that burns with felt life, but they wind up with a failure of historical imagination that undermines a harrowing true story.|Rotten
Bristles with anger but undermined by a meandering, repetitive story that doesn't come together well enough to make the arduous experience worthwhile.|Rotten
"Can you say dull and manipulative, boys and girls? Stereotypes and clichés abound in ""Detroit,"" a movie that's more messy than the city, like many others, still rebounding from oh so many socio-economic struggles."|Rotten
John Boyega is fascinating as Melvin Dismukes, a black security guard who tried to mediate between the cops and victims. He's humane, tense, cautious -- a man caught between two racial worlds at war.|Fresh
Maddeningly imperfect but still honorable.|Fresh
Detroit is an imperfect but entirely gripping drama.|Fresh
Detroit is a well-crafted movie, but the filmmakers keep the characters at a distance from us, in a manner that is as detached as the film itself.|Rotten
Expect to see multiple Oscar nominations for Detroit. Expect to see some controversy, too, in part because African-Americans might wonder whether it's Bigelow's and Boal's story to tell.|Fresh
It's a powerful reminder of our ugly past and a hugely important topic, but it is not an especially captivating film.|Rotten
What's shown on the screen is not only frightening; it is debilitating to sit through...I saw it at a 10 a.m. screening and felt wiped out the rest of the day...I don't know what really happened there, but this is certainly a compelling film.|Fresh
Academy Award winner Kathryn Bigelow uses her penchant for making audiences uncomfortable in Detroit, a disturbing examination of an ugly chapter in America's past.|Fresh
"Relentless in its storytelling, ""Detroit"" is a film of blistering impact."|Fresh
A striking dramatization blended with graphic newsreel footage makes this an absorbing and, at times, harrowing experience.|Fresh
Skillfullybrings a still-relevant history to the screen, but is Bigelow'sretellingfor the education of white audiences, or to understand violence inflicted on black Americans by white folks?|Fresh
Detroit is an extraordinarily accomplished sequence within a good movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Crude, powerful and needs to be seen. Bigelow's latest will move you. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Detroit makes for a disturbing and unnerving portrayal of real historical events, but has less success as a work of sociopolitical commentary.|Fresh
The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on, making Detroit urgent viewing regardless of its character-development flaws.|Fresh
Detroit eventually becomes more of an exercise in authoritative sadism than social commentary, less insightful about such evil than, whoa, do you believe they got away with this?|Fresh
Flaws and all, Detroit is still well worth seeing -- shedding a sobering light on an extreme case of criminality under the color of authority.|Fresh
The unsatisfactory outcome of the trial and the pivot to character emphasis at the end only complicates Detroit's pace and narrative problems.|Rotten
"""Detroit"" is a crushingly visceral experience, one filled with indignation not only for what went on in 1967 but for today's troubling displays of shoot-first law enforcement."|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal return with a ferociously angry social horror movie.|Fresh
"If a fact-based drama like ""Detroit"" succeeds or fails based on how well it illuminates some of the events that brought us to where we are now, then I'd call it a resounding success."|Fresh
Bigelow is trying to get us to feel something -- what it's like to be terrorized by the forces that are supposed to be protecting us, for one thing -- and she will violate our assumptions about movie-watching to do it.|Fresh
"""Detroit"" may be flawed in its bluntness and its inability to provide every character with an interior existence beyond villain and victim. But it remains inescapable in its conclusions ..."|Fresh
Perhaps, with another writer on board or a more diverse production team, there might've been a marriage of conceptual visuals and delicate storytelling ...|Fresh
"Lack of Emotional Connection Bogs Down ""Detroit."""|Rotten
"""Detroit,"" as a movie, is all over the place, yet oddly that messiness is one of its strengths."|Fresh
Bigelow and Mark Boal's simply-structured racially-charged horror story is their most harrowing work together. Yes, even more harrowing than watching a guy defuse bombs in The Hurt Locker.|Fresh
The film's themes of tragedy and injustice resonate with chilling contemporary relevance, ringing across the distance of the ages.|Fresh
Admirably intense, but the film lacks focus.|Rotten
Incendiary|Fresh
...as a 62 year old white film critic, let me point out that there's nothing here that black viewers don't already know. It's white moviegoers who need to see this.|Fresh
Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd gives the movie a visceral immediacy, putting viewers in the middle of the chaos and violence. The movie's structure isn't nearly as effective.|Fresh
The film steps on your neck, cutting off your air and daring you to attempt looking away.|Fresh
What the filmmakers leave us with is a deeper understanding of how those five days in July changed lives -- and an implicit hope that that understanding will change our lives as well.|Fresh
No matter what, you will be angry after watching Detroit. But will you be angry at the world... or angry at this film?|Fresh
When [Kathryn] Bigelow traps us inside the Algiers [Hotel], Detroit packs more of a punch than any other film this year.|Fresh
Another Profound Film by Kathryn Bigelow|Fresh
It's undeniably powerful, meant to unnerve and confront, but it's also something of a missed opportunity and a disappointment, coming after the pair's previous triumphs in social and political commentary.|Fresh
Bigelow has a way of making scripted drama feel like an utterly gripping newsreel.|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow's docudrama arrests you, lines you up against a wall, points a gun at your head, and leaves it there for an hour - it's an account of police brutality that is itself brutal by design.|Fresh
Detroit turns inward, toward sustained assault, devolving to that single location [and] an hours-long, night-long siege, drenched in threat and threatened, rage-filled masculinity and whiteness... a bleak realization of irresolvable horror.|Fresh
Detroit is so effective at what it does and how it accomplishes its aims that it becomes almost unwatchable.|Fresh
Katherine Bigelow's powerful testament reminds us not just of our history, but, especially in light of recent events, makes us wonder if we, indeed, have learned anything from it.|Fresh
This unreconciled and incomplete film does an unusually good job of terrifying and unsettling us, before sending us back out into a world that's more like 1967 than we'd care to admit.|Fresh
Riveting revisionist history setting the record straight in a way which will undoubtedly resonate with the Black Lives Matter Movement.|Fresh
The filmmakers are better at presenting the events of July 1967 than explaining them.|Fresh
Expect Bigelow's deep-cutting drama to be part of the conversation come awards season.|Fresh
"In some ways, ""Detroit"" is Bigelow's simplest work to date. Not that its methods are anything but agile and deft."|Fresh
What Bigelow does - incomparably - is put us in that room with those people at that moment. She induces a feeling of powerlessness that's beyond our capacity to imagine on our own, and she keeps it going ...|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow's latest nerve-scraper is another journalistic war film, only this time set not in the Middle East but the race-riot-shattered streets of America, circa 1967.|Fresh
...ambitious in scope and somewhat struggles for it.|Fresh
It has flaws, but they are faults that can be forgiven in view of the film's sheer cinematic power, as well as its historical significance and topical relevance.|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow hyper-realistically, almost dispassionately, covers her ensemble's actions in the manner of a somber disaster film.|Fresh
A film that is constantly at war with itself, moving from gratuitous violence to toothless editorialization at a moment's notice.|Fresh
Detroit is not a relaxing, fun-filled evening at the movies. It's a cavalcade of injustice. But it's one of the most meaningful films of 2017.|Fresh
What we see in Detroit is so shocking and appalling that it is perhaps unreasonable to blame the film for being blinded in rage by it. But, alas, blinded it is.|Fresh
What's missing from Bigelow's film is not sensitivity but nuance. Her characters never come alive, moving through the film less as people than entries in a sociology textbook.|Rotten
"""Detroit"" is yet another masterpiece from that most singular of American directors, Kathryn Bigelow."|Fresh
The problems with Detroit are especially vexing because there is a lot of very good stuff to be had in it as well.|Fresh
While it takes place in 1967 during the racially-charged 12th Street Riots, the prejudice, injustice, and police violence could be ripped from the headlines today.|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow's latest is another demystification of genre, this time detailing an act of historical evil as a grindhouse snuff film.|Fresh
Detroit is angry, lucid, bludgeoning, subtle, and at times surprisingly moving.|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal return to greatness with Detroit.|Fresh
Even though it's based on an episode that occurred half a century ago, it feels like [Bigelow's] timeliest movie yet.|Fresh
Detroit takes an unyielding look at police violence in a way few major Hollywood films have, examining how easily a bad situation can worsen in the wrong, delusional hands.|Fresh
Detroit was directed, written, produced, shot, and edited by white creatives who do not understand the weight of the images they hone in on with an unflinching gaze.|Rotten
After sitting through Detroit's two hours and twenty-three minutes of incessant tragedy, it is hard to come up with any salvation.|Rotten
It ranks as one of the most bleak, most harrowing, and harrowingly significant, movies about US racial dynamics to have emerged from the studio system.|Fresh
It is not an easy watch, and it is an essential one.|Fresh
[A]ll of it becomes a harsh reminder that, even though we may learn from the past, we still seem doomed to repeat it.|Fresh
The film's unflinching gaze on a lawless night will likely be politicized, but calling Detroit anti-police misses the mark. The question Detroit begs is, in a democratic nation, to whom does the law apply?|Fresh
Its goal is to make us into witnesses and bystanders -- to put us into the shoes of those who stand by and watch, feeling helpless even when we're not -- something it achieves through confident, pulsating filmmaking and emotional performances.|Fresh
Dramatically relentless and emotionally shattering, it brings news from a turbulent past that casts a baleful light on America's troubled present.|Fresh
A gruelling, nightmarish, ferociously vivid riot epic that recreates one of the darkest chapters in American history. Unflinching, unmissable and terrifyingly pertinent.|Fresh
The filmmakers are less successful at explaining the social context of the riot or portraying the aftermath of the violence, though these shortcomings are mitigated somewhat by the strong performances, particularly from John Boyega.|Fresh
"While ""Detroit"" may try and cover too much ground and occasionally stumble on its ambition, the sheer visceral power of Kathryn Bigelow's direction is worth championing."|Fresh
Tense, excruciating and entirely necessary ...|Fresh
The scenes are powerful; the characters are powerless. The result is a sense of utter claustrophobia and dread.|Fresh
An artfully frazzled mosaic of suffering, putting the audience through the wringer in the name of truth, injustice and what many see, still, as the American way with police brutality.|Fresh
It is designed to make you angry, and it does nothing to soften the blow or create some artificial uplift. But there is something about honesty that's exhilarating.|Fresh
There is even a reason to admire its dawdling moments: Among all the movies that wallow in the horrors of violence against America's black citizenry, there are few that devote this much time to grief.|Fresh
The film's struggle against simplification - against the sentimentality, wishful thinking and outright denial that defines most Hollywood considerations of America's racial past - is palpable, almost heroic, even if it is not always successful.|Fresh
Director Bigelow and screenwriter Boal take the Detroit race riots of half a century ago and create a hardcore masterpiece that digs into our violent past to hold up a dark mirror to the systemic racism that still rages in the here and now.|Fresh
"Ingenious storytelling by Bigelow. By forcing the audience to ask ""Well why didn't they just do this?"" it forces the viewer to recognize their own prejudice and the questions that get asked every time police brutality comes up in the news."|Fresh
Anthony Mackie is a standout as a careful Vietnam vet, a guy who's only moved from one battlefield to another. John Boyega is heartbreaking as a decent man who only wants to keep the peace - and finds himself abetting a war.|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow's tough docudrama Detroit begins as a frightening, authentic re-creation of the Motor City's 1967 race riots, then roller-coasters into scenes of claustrophobic brutality more akin to a home-invasion horror tale -- and just as deep.|Fresh
The standoff at the Algiers Motel has entered legend (if not widely known history) as a notorious incident of interrogatory injustice. Bigelow makes it the centerpiece of Detroit and, simply put, has crafted her most harrowing piece of filmmaking.|Fresh
It has relevance and passion, and by finding the story's heart in the music of the Dramatics, Bigelow creates a humanity amid the anguish.|Fresh
While its centrepiece section justifies a recommendation all on its own, the material that makes up the rest of Detroit is not without some problems.|Fresh
Detroit is a must-see film not only because it recreates an era and a series of incidents that could easily be forgotten in today's culture of short-term attention, but because the conditions that led to these horrors are still with us .|Fresh
Anyone who doesn't understand the Black Lives Matter movement would be well advised to take in Kathryn Bigelow's terrifyingly immersive account of the Detroit riots...Poulter...chills the blood as the face of American racism with the power of a badge.|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal are to be commended for tackling important and pertinent stories, but Detroit is a mixed bag. In your face filmmaking packs a wallop but ultimately sheds no new light on the race war in America 50 years later.|Fresh
An American horror story rooted so deeply and shamefully in home soil that it is still painful to watch half a century after the true events it's based on took place.|Fresh
Far from ancient history.|Fresh
With the BANG of a starter's pistol, a hot snowball of rage and fear starts rolling downhill, gathering speed as all struggle to get out of the way.|Fresh
It hurts, because it needs to. This is not a film about civic pride or the city's comeback. We have to own this, and Bigelow highlights this ugly moment on its 50th anniversary. Yes, the city has moved on, but this incident still stings.|Fresh
A drama as powerful as it is timely.|Fresh
Intense and physically powerful in the way it conveys its atrocious events, the film nonetheless remains short on complexity, as if it were enough simply to provoke and outrage the audience. It's a grim tale with no catharsis.|Fresh
Detroit plays out like a real life horror movie.|Fresh
I am talking about a powerful piece of storytelling that is the best film so far this year.|Fresh
A work of consummate skill which kicks into high gear when the focus turns from widespread civil unrest to the very specific.|Fresh
"A cauldron of anger, fear and chaos, ""Detroit"" is guided by the unbridled emotions of its imperiled characters, resulting in a drama which is at times inelegant in its rage but nonetheless produces a grim wallop"|Fresh
"""Detroit"" taps into something real and too familiar. Its vivacious and riveting interior matches its passionate and acute exterior."|Fresh
"The ""incident,"" which eats up about an hour of the middle, may be the greatest thing Kathryn Bigelow's ever made."|Fresh
Kathryn Bigelow's harrowing docudrama is a bumpy but bracingly physical portrait of race in america.|Fresh
Detroit is such a gripping and ultimately shattering piece of cinema that it merits seeing-albeit with a skeptical eye.|Fresh
