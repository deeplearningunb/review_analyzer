This beautiful and continually surprising film makes us think about what children can and can't bear.|Fresh
Cartoon Saloon has already received two Oscar nominations for The Secret Of Kells and Song Of The Sea and this gritty animation about life under the Taliban deserves to make it a hat-trick.|Fresh
It is thoughtful, wonderfully made and tells a story we all need to hear, whether we like it or not.|Fresh
"The beautiful animation feels graceful and lived-in, never depicting an ""other"". The absence of any American characters speaks to commitment in showing the Afghan perspective..."|Fresh
Not the most obvious subjects for a family animation, but The Breadwinner tackles them all with devastating economy.|Fresh
The Breadwinner is thrillingly alive with the delicacy, artistry and wit of human touch.|Fresh
A fiery takedown of fundamentalism, bigotry and oppression of all stripes.|Fresh
There's a calmness and clarity to this engaging animation...|Fresh
Against the odds, the tone here is optimistic about human nature. The film even manages to be uplifting, a small miracle given the darkness of its themes.|Fresh

The Breadwinner has all of the right ingredients to be examined in depth by schools in Ireland, and hopefully, one day, by every child around the world.|Fresh
You can't tell a tale of fanaticism's evil without violence; so violence there is. And pain; and grief; and sharp-clawed deprivation.|Fresh

The biggest criticism of The Breadwinner for me is not one of the film itself, which is undoubtedly a triumph of storytelling, but simply that I'm not sure exactly who it intends to tell the story to.|Fresh
These excursions are exhilarating for their freedom, but also fraught with danger.|Fresh
Parvana copes by telling fables of wild animals and quests-these sections are dense and vivid, paper cutouts on layered backgrounds, providing cathartic levity in a very serious movie.|Fresh
A dance between exhilarating escapades and unthinkable brutality, which though largely confined to offscreen spaces nonetheless lurks over the movie like a dark cloud.|Fresh
A major achievement for Twomey and her Kilkenny collaborators at Cartoon Saloon, The Breadwinner is worthy of a wide viewing audience.|Fresh

An animated feature about a young girl who defies the Taliban in Afghanistan through her courage and storytelling.|Fresh
The movie throbs with a confidence that is as alarming as it is heart-wrenching.|Fresh

...unfolds with an animated artistry that is nothing short of majestic.|Fresh
The key is that The Breadwinner finds hope, even in this violent place. The climax's descent into chaos is certainly not a fairy-tale ending, but it puts forth a message that courageous acts, even by a child, can make a difference.|Fresh
The film is a perfect representation of what an animated film can do-showing life from a different visual perspective.|Fresh

"One can only salute the filmmakers' ambition and seriousness of purpose, but it's hard to see who ""The Breadwinner"" audience is."|Rotten
The animation for The Breadwinner is exquisite, the music finely composed and performed, and the story worth telling in a world where millions of girls still do not have access to education.|Fresh
What's lovely about the story, too, is how feminine it is, and the characters that we're rooting for, whose perspectives we're following are all women and girls, each of whom are nuanced, complicated characters.|Fresh

"In its power and its beauty, ""The Breadwinner' reminds us that animation can be every bit as much of a medium for adults as it is for children."|Fresh
Harsh disappointments befall the characters, and they are depicted frankly, but in a way that encourages young viewers to form an affinity with the characters rather than cringe at terror.|Fresh
Cross-dressing in the story is merely a tool for survival, but such border-crossing is inevitably rife with unintended consequences beyond narrative ones.|Rotten
It directly confronts the misogyny and chauvinism of contemporary Afghanistan, while powerfully suggesting that storytelling is both a means of coping and a solution for change.|Fresh
Jewel-bright and heart-wrenching.|Fresh
Finally this desert fable is another necessary reminder that animation is a medium rather than a genre. It's capable of generating myriad kinds of wonder and has the ability to tell any kind of story.|Fresh
The film's strongest appeal is for readers of the series and animation fans.|Rotten
The Breadwinner offers no respect or agency to real women; it's almost as if Twomey et al were consciously trying to set feminist postcolonial theory back by 20 years.|Rotten

There's room for humour, too, especially within the magical stories Parvana narrates, a complementary storyline rendered with breathtaking imagery and packing an emotional gut punch.|Fresh
The Breadwinner thus becomes an empowering story of heroism under duress.|Fresh
The picture sings and inspires.|Fresh
