Here's a film directed by a relative newcomer, Asghar Farhadi, that feels just as fresh as films by his predecessors, yet it also turns slightly inward, getting a little closer to the more turbulent human emotions.|Fresh
This is a very well acted film by the three main actors. The central part of the story (by writer-director Asghar Farhadi of 'A Separation') is powerful.|Fresh
It would be easy to write Fireworks Wednesday off as a melodrama, but Farhadi builds it so methodically and so intentionally, that you get a sense for every character, and every revelation hits harder than the last.|Fresh
Although Fireworks Wednesday holds its own among Farhadi's impressive catalog, it's not his best.|Fresh
A film whose power lies in its subtleties, in its hidden fire.|Fresh
[In a] Farhadi film... each divulged bit of information forces the audience, and the characters, to reevaluate what they thought they understood.|Fresh
"Farhadi refined his vision and technique in later films like ""A Separation,"" but ""Fireworks Wednesday"" is a strong and resonant early work, and it's gratifying that it's finally seeing the light of day in the West."|Fresh
Fireworks is an exhausting film that might telegraph some of its twists, but Farhadi still manages to make them feel devastating in the moment.|Fresh
It was made 10 years ago but plays like new with its timeless scenes of marital strife and all the lying, deceiving and mistrust that go with it.|Fresh
Not one of Farhadi's subtler projects.|Fresh

Not one of Farhadi's subtler projects.|Fresh
A sure sense of suspense, which often simmers when the most commonplace of gestures is mistaken for the deepest betrayal... may well be another Farhadi masterpiece.|Fresh
This is one helluva day in the life and shows a great deal of enthusiasm by the much younger Asghar Farhadi.|Fresh
Fireworks Wednesday could work just as well as a chamber play as a film, but Farhadi uses the medium to careful, cunning effects.|Fresh
"While ""Fireworks Wednesday"" is a bit more obvious with its tale of household unrest, it captures human reaction wonderfully, keeping a tight leash on melodramatic impulses."|Fresh
It's an artfully told tale, looping and relooping secrets and lies.|Fresh
Gotta hand it to Asghar Farhadi: When he promises fireworks in the title of Fireworks Wednesday, he delivers, both literally and figuratively.|Fresh
It is becoming increasingly apparent that Asghar Farhadi is one of the world's top filmmakers, and there's an appetite for his work.|Fresh
A loopy, off-the-wall tragicomedy that chronicles a particularly stressful day in the life of a miserably unhappy couple whose marriage is on its last legs.|Fresh
"What pulls us into ""Fireworks Wednesday"" is the universality of the emotions its characters display and the familiarity of the situations they find themselves in."|Fresh
Another precisely calibrated, culturally specific demonstration of Farhadi's skills in constructing empathy machines.|Fresh
It isn't the subtlest motif, but Farhadi's message is clear: Even the most idyllic-seeming marriage is nothing more or less than a series of landmines to be skirted with the utmost care.|Fresh
"While not as brilliant as his 2012 Oscar-winning ""A Separation"" or 2009's ""About Elly,"" the film has the same qualities of compassion and suspense that have made Farhadi one of the world's most acclaimed directors."|Fresh
Farhadi has a terrific sense of touch. He knows how to use visual and dramatic means to make a milieu palpable to an audience.|Fresh
Judged inside or outside of its creator's ongoing career-as early proof of his gifts or just a stand-alone domestic drama with the extra kick of mystery the filmmaker always applies-Fireworks Wednesday fascinates.|Fresh
Another demonstration of Farhadi's ability to diagnose his country's ills through the microcosm of the family drama.|Fresh
Asghar Farhadi's exquisite, complex family drama approaches class conflicts and contrasts in contemporary Iran with a richly layered story.|Fresh
As with Mr. Farhadi's other films, every detail of speech and body language resonates.|Fresh
Not just interesting in how it foreshadows the filmmaker's more mature works, but also a gripping piece of storytelling in its own right.|Fresh
Asghar Farhadi's 2006 film interrogates the tensions between tactility and vision in complex ways.|Fresh
This is a thoroughly engrossing and densely textured drama, showing Farhadi's cool skill in dissecting the Iranian middle classes and the unhappiness of marriage.|Fresh
...a depressing introduction to the duplicity of adulthood.|Fresh
|Fresh
Delves into the messy lives of modern-day Iranians living a tense life in bustling Tehran.|Fresh
This is director Asghar Farhadi's third feature, and it's brilliantly assured, both in the fluidity and unexpected stylishness of the camerawork and in the subtlety with which Farhadi and co-writer Mani Haghighi explore the complexities of modern [Iran].|Fresh
