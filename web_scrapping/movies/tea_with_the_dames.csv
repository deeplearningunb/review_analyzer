The real meat of the film is how respectfully it portrays their insane level of talent and knowledge and how refreshingly realistic it is in how it portrays their advanced age.|Fresh
The premise sounds like a bit of a snore. Four octogenarians get together at a quiet country estate. They have tea in the garden, then go into the house when it starts raining. The end. There's very little action. But there's plenty of drama.|Fresh
"This is for you if you enjoy gorgeous homes, crisp accents, and great pashminas during moments where Judi Dench has a reason to call herself a ""menopausal dwarf"" in the context of being cast to play a legendary beauty."|Fresh
Do you need a life pick-me-up? The dames are here for you.|Fresh
Tea With the Dames peters out as a conversation, given there's no real beginning, middle or end to the film. It's a privilege, however, to have been given a tableside seat to listen to this foursome reminisce and ruminate for an hour and a half.|Fresh
Their actual outsized personalities do not disappoint in this lively and intimate doc.|Fresh
It's not going to be a blockbuster and won't engage the majority of moviegoers, but for those it does, it's priceless.|Fresh
Gathered outdoors in Dame Joan's garden for a bit of a gossip and a stroll down memory lane, they entertain each other and the crew as well as us, then the rains come, driving them inside for a wee bit more. Here's a good one.|Fresh
It's an intimate and unpretentious opportunity to sit down with a quartet of incredible talents outside of standard, static talk show settings.|Fresh
Hard to imagine a lovelier fly-on-the-wall experience, a wickedly-hilarious piece of oral stage history with a glimpse of the chemistry that bonds these four women, friends since they were barely more than precocious schoolgirls.|Fresh

Too much time is given to the legends complaining about the rigors of filming this documentary, but it's ultimately big fun having tea with these Dames.|Fresh
We're treated to the illusion of intimacy and some witty rapport (mostly by Maggie Smith), but one leaves the theatre thinking the movie only scratched the surface.|Rotten
When the visit ends, one is grateful simply to have been in their esteemed company.|Fresh
Utterly delicious, this tea with Champagne with the Dames.|Fresh
Tea With The Dames is an excellent introduction to the careers of these 4 women, but unfortunately it isn't able to devote the time necessary to give a full picture of its subjects lives and contributions to the world of film and theater.|Fresh
As the tea turns to champagne and they talk about their mortality and the indignities of aging, the four women stop being famous actresses and seem like any other group of old friends.|Fresh
"""Tea with the Dames"" is hardly a groundbreaking documentary to watch. However, for fans of the craft of acting and of these legends, it's a can't miss."|Fresh
These four great ladies of stage, screen, and television, and longtime friends in real life, get together for an afternoon of tea and conversation -- always, trenchant, often hilarious.|Fresh
An endearing introduction to a wealth of celebrated performances. And for those who are well-acquainted with the dames, the film is everything you'd expect it to be and more.|Fresh
Director Roger Michell gets these grand gals to talk and talk and talk some more. Obviously, though, no direction is needed for them to make us smile and even touch us, too.|Fresh
Maggie Smith, wow is she hilarious! If anything, you'll wonder how she hasn't been given more comedic roles.|Fresh
This is not really a film about friendship; it's a true and rare sisterhood of British theater royalty, and it's a privilege to be allowed to sit in on it and share their tea.|Fresh
Tea with the Dames will enchant fans of the actresses, and it is nice to see them for who they are, swapping acting tips, or talking about milestones in their careers. It's a nice documentary, but it is also far too slight and polite.|Fresh
The documentary Tea With the Dames... is pure catnip for movie lovers, drama geeks and anybody who loves a good yarn.|Fresh
Tea with the Dames is absolutely charming and surprisingly emotional. As viewers are welcomed into the garden of Plowright's home, they will find a respite from the world...|Fresh
This is a remarkable, moving, one-of-a-kind picture.|Fresh
Anyone who is a fan of acting legends should give Nothing Like a Dame a spin. Ideally during a sunny afternoon, with a spot of tea and finger food at the ready.|Fresh
That's not to say the whole isn't still extremely entertaining with their wealth of humor and priceless anecdotes. It simply never quite delivers what it appears to sell.|Fresh
Don't be surprised if you crave a second cup, served just like this one, straight with no sugar.|Fresh
... provides a fitting tribute to each member of the quartet, with a few surprising insights and witticisms along the way.|Fresh
I even made a cup of tea beforehand so I, too, could have tea with these Great Dames.|Fresh
It is intimate, a little salty, and most entertaining.|Fresh
Tea with the Dames, a documentary that captures a frank discussion among four prestigious actresses, has plenty of wisdom to offer.|Fresh
Tea with the Dames is one of the most delightful documentaries to come along in a period that has been full of wonderful documentaries.|Fresh
Tea With The Dames  is a truly wonderful way to spend an afternoon. An afternoon with these British treasures is an afternoon well spent.|Fresh

Call it a gabfest. Label it a talkathon. But Tea with the Dames, directed by Roger Michell, is so much more.|Fresh
Dench tells a biting story of being ignored and treated like a feeble ghost...|Fresh
...captures the particular camaraderie of women who've cleverly navigated a field dominated by diva-ish men.|Fresh
Although they touch upon their fear of loneliness, Tea With The Dames is bright because of the greatness of their camaraderie.|Fresh
A conversational feast with four acting Dames-Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins and Joan Plowright-who are not above profane fun and confessions that make them human. Don't miss the chance to bask in the pleasure of their company.|Fresh
The assembled dames are so smart, witty and strong-willed, it's a wrench to have to part company from them at the end of the film.|Fresh
A consistently hilarious 90-minute chat that could have gone on for twice as long (or, ideally, a weekly television series) without ever feeling like too much of a good thing.|Fresh
You couldn't be in better company than these four theatrical giantesses in this often delightful but sometimes frustratingly glib doc.|Fresh
At a scant 83 minutes, the film's most egregious sin is that there isn't more of it. Roger Mitchell could easily have made a full-length series out of this wistful gossip sesh amongst a quartet of lifelong friends who just so happen to be living legends.|Fresh
It plays like the jazzy riff of a seasoned quartet, complete with buoyant solos that may not connect to much else but are still a joy to witness all the same.|Fresh
Talky doc fun for fans but unlikely to hold teen interest.|Fresh
"A takeaway from ""Tea With the Dames"" is that conversation is itself a kind of performance art, and it follows that these women do it better than most."|Fresh
"In a perfect world, ""Tea With the Dames"" could be a series. Let us be flies on the wall for this posse's weekly gathering for tea and convivial cackling."|Fresh

Entertaining conversations among four grand Dames of the English theatre and film scene about their public and private lives.|Fresh
Tea With the Dames makes you see these four geniuses more deeply and realize that impaired vision isn't their main problem - it's society's occasional blindness to the value of our most mature, most valuable talents.|Fresh
For the simple idea of sitting them all at a table and turning on a couple of movie cameras, the director Roger Mitchell should get a royal commendation himself.|Fresh
'Tea with the Dames' is an enjoyablylighthearted trip down memory lane between longtime friends, who give you enough sips of their lives to quench your thirst.|Fresh
As delicious as its sounds, breezing through easy banter that's been in play for decades.|Fresh
While no one actually drinks any tea in director Roger Michell's film, the women profiled metaphorically spill the tea on their co-stars, each other and the industry at large.|Fresh
The movie is akin to sitting down with your friends and having a great chat. I'd easily have watched a longer cut of this.|Fresh
"Fair warning. It was about ten seconds into this film when the first ""Hello, darling"" dissolved any critical distance I could muster."|Fresh
Director Roger Michell did a beautiful job with his gentle, hands-off approach, which led to a marvellously entertaining programme.|Fresh
You don't have to be familiar with all of their work to appreciate their experience and the words of wisdom they impart on the audience.|Fresh
It is hard to overstate the charm of this restrained and intimate film.|Fresh
It's not just what she says but the way she says it, that makes Judi Dench's advice to her younger self so moving. Be less susceptible to falling in love, she says. This is one of the wonderful moments in this fly-on-the-wall documentary...|Fresh
A lovely, lively and quick little eavesdrop session.|Fresh
...the film plays out like you're sitting down for an afternoon cuppa with four of Britain's most talented actresses, listening to their stories and having a good old cackle, like friends do.|Fresh
Its slow unfurling allowed us to imagine we were eavesdropping. Here was fame, but here, too, was intimacy.|Fresh
"ut despite ""Mags"" and ""Jude"" sometimes living up to their cantankerous reputations, this isn't an all-star episode of Grumpy Old Women. Instead, it's an absorbing and fascinating look back at the last 60 years of British stage and screen."|Fresh
A torrent of mischief, gossip, swearing, recitations, singing and reminiscence.|Fresh
"And when Nothing Like a Dame draws to a close with audio of Dench reciting ""our revels now are ended"", the only possible response is to insist that they are not."|Fresh
The rapport between this formidable quartet is palpable, and they all contribute some delightful stories.|Fresh
The casualness of it all means that the few downbeat moments - chiefly thoughts on ageing - are all the more poignant.|Fresh
A joyful tonic of a film.|Fresh
Can there be any sight more English than Dames Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins and Joan Plowright sitting bickering in a garden overlooking the Sussex countryside?|Fresh
The laughter and pure hysteria are infectious in this wildly enjoyable film.|Fresh
