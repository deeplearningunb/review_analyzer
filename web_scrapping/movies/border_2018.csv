Like a mating between the mind of David Cronenberg and something that crawled out of a compost heap.|Fresh
The film huddles closely around a personality whose courage and determination invite great empathy.|Fresh
There are bits of everything in here: gender studies, fairytales, myth and sci-fi. It's profoundly preposterous, but delivered at all times with a deliciously straight face.|Fresh
Border is strange, disturbing and brave in its own way, but not everyone will be willing to accept its nervy, visceral terror.|Rotten
Abassi does such a fine job of rooting his protagonist's otherness in a realistic setting that even when he starts incrementally weaving in more fantastical elements, the story always feels plausible.|Fresh
Border is a wonderfully original film, which blends horror tropes and Scandinavian folklore to mesmerising effect.|Fresh
The strangeness in this film writhes like bacteria.|Fresh
There's a lot to get your teeth into, but Border struggles with its opposing instincts.|Rotten

Beneath her layers of make-up and prosthetics, [Eva] Melander gives a fine and moving performance as the customs officer with the unlikely powers.|Fresh
Excellent modern fairy tale of identity and otherness.|Fresh
Telling an age-old story in a singularly original way, Border is a compelling, sometimes excruciating fairy tale for our times...|Fresh
The film's otherworldly elements never feel too fantastical, grounded by Eva Melander giving genuine heft to Tina's emotional journey.|Fresh
Border argues that the full integration of the other is not always possible, that the existence of another involves living with differences that are not going to be filed. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of [the 2018] Cannes Film Festival's most pleasant surprises. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of the most bold and fascinating films in recent times. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
With captivating and grounded performances by our lead cast and some truly breathtaking storytelling, Border is a human story like you've never seen before.|Fresh
Leaving one's comfort zone and opening your eyes to the real world is a message beautifully conveyed in this film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
In 'Border' remain, as indelible marks, its passionate reflections on identity in many aspects. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
There's something about its aura that keeps drawing me in, even though I take issue with how it handles its sensitive subject matter.|Fresh
For those that can adjust to the weirdness there lies rewards; Border's daring moments pulsate with life. But it struggles to stay cohesive and compelling under the weight of its own ambitious fusions.|Fresh
A film filled with memorable imagery (and one or two that you really can't unsee), Border might not quite reach the heights of Let the Right One In, but it certainly leaves an impression.|Fresh
Both totally beguiling and borderline sick-making at times, Border gets pretty gnarly in places.|Fresh
...one of the most singular and genre-defying films to come along the pike in a great while... An absolute cracker.|Fresh
The emotional complexity of the character is, in fact, the strongest strength of the film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Fascinating strangeness. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a drama with the force of comedy. It's Bu√±uel without renouncing Tod Browning. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
An exceptional work that... is one of the most fascinating film experiences that European cinema has given us in recent years. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Dosing each revelation with palpable wisdom, Border knows to go one step ahead of the imagination of the spectator. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
I felt uncomfortable watching some scenes in this film, but ultimately, it is rewarding. In an era of so many sequels, remakes and derivative movies, it is nice to see one that is so original.|Fresh
Beautifully filmed (especially the forest sections) and well acted.|Fresh
A disquieting road to self-knowledge. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
However unsettling you may find Border, its grip is as strong as its convictions.|Fresh
This Swedish film pulls on the tradition of trolls and drops them into contemporary society. The lead actress' deep soulfulness helps the audience suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in this tale of immigration, parenthood and sexuality.|Fresh
Border spins an old-fashioned tale about good and evil, but it does so in surprising ways that allow breathing room for all manner of very timely concerns.|Fresh
A confounding smash-up of genres, of societal themes, and of various fantasy mythologies, making for a film that is equally as interesting as I am personally disturbed by it.|Fresh
Border is bizarre and disturbing, and I enjoyed it almost as much as Vore enjoys everything. Be forewarned, though. This fairy tale is not Cinderella.|Fresh
Border can be tender and liberating, furious and disgusting, and even polemic in its vision of decaying humankind. In this case, and for its arresting visuals and compelling narrative, it's easy to conclude that this is no minor work.|Fresh
Border is a whimsical and dark fairy tale for adults that tackles uncomfortable material in a fascinating way.|Fresh
With minimal but perfectly placed special effects, this superb film oozes despair but it also shares hope.|Fresh
Abbasi delivers formidable jolts because his deliberate pacing and low-key approach make the revelations all the more stunning.|Fresh
Some people will think this is the worst movie of the year. Others will love it. Both groups won't be able to stop talking about it.|Fresh
"One of the best foreign language offerings of 2018, ""Border"" is a unique and special story about the importance of finding oneself by examining the most intimate characteristics."|Fresh
A moving celebration of the potential to simply do good.|Fresh
From the outset, you know that Tina is different. Smartly, director Ali Abbasi takes his time: at first, slowly creating a mystery about Tina; then, leisurely revealing bits and pieces about her true identity ...|Fresh
Although it might make you squirm with discomfort, this offbeat Swedish romantic fantasy is tender and poignant beneath the surface.|Fresh
"Give ""Border"" credit for daring to be different, and daring to find timely questions about strangers within a monster-movie premise."|Fresh
The first transfixing hour of Border will stick in the minds of viewers nicely. The second hour is just a bunch of stuff that happens to bring it all home to a conclusion.|Fresh
A look at the cruelty of humanity that's as Del Toro-esque as it is original. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
This fascinating sci-fi story is grounded in realism and imbued with grace.|Fresh
Don't wait for an English-language remake, if there is one; let the mood and the sound of this one seep into your soul.|Fresh
There are lots of things going on in this film, from the normal to the creepy to the very strange. But director Ali Abbasi succeeds in keeping the film feeling like more like a drama, than an oddity or an arty creature feature.|Fresh
Rich in folkloric and quasi-supernatural elements, it fascinates and surprises in equal measure.|Fresh
He mines John Ajvide Lindqvist's (Let the Right One In) short story of outsider love and Nordic folklore for ideas of radicalization, empowerment, gender fluidity and feminine rage.|Fresh
"The film raises questions about ""borders"" of many kinds - including racial and sexual - that it doesn't resolve, but it's a memorable, provocative watch."|Fresh
A grown-up fairytale and a love story with that traditional mix of light and darkness. Eva Melander is emotionally devastating; Eero Milonoff's performance is unsettling and ambiguous. Brilliant and frustrating, every reveal raising so many questions.|Fresh
Working beneath layers of prosthetics, makeup and an additional forty pounds, Eva Melander creates such a compelling, compassionate character, we find ourselves forgetting all about her unconventional looks.|Fresh
An odd-looking man named Vore enters her life, who slowly, steadily and with certainty, confuses her, her sense of scent, her sense of herself. Strange meets strange.... stories that bloom around them like so much madness come to dark life.|Fresh
It's as melancholic as it is romantic, even when elements from Scandinavian folklore infused into the story take its characters into unexpected territory.|Fresh
A lot of people will relate to 'Border' in terms of beauty, romance, internal and external conflicts while also developing a more open understanding of other cultural and personal differences.|Fresh
Border is less invested in glib symbolism or political commentary than in the specific, felt experience of being adrift between social boundaries and categories.|Fresh
Director Ali Abbasi juggles multiple tones and storylines thanks to the strength of this central relationship.|Fresh
Border has the wry playfulness and clear-eyed strangeness of Lars Von Trier, but somehow more earnest, and more empathatic. It's truly something special.|Fresh
Border is so dark, bizarre, and yet sentimental that its very existence feels like a miracle.|Fresh
The film's slow reveal of its fantastical elements, which evoke the erratic, dreamlike strangeness of folk tales, makes them all the more unsettling.|Fresh
An indie full of smart allegories on immigration politics, with a little bit of lo-fi fashionable horror sprinkled in.|Fresh
It's a film of great breath and insights, one that makes you see beyond appearances to get a better understanding of people and the way they think.|Fresh
The weird and wonderful gothic tale behaves like David Cronenberg's misbegotten son. Abbasi's film requires the audience to navigate past layers of repulsiveness before you recognize that what you are seeing is an abstract form of beauty.|Fresh
Even the most open-minded viewers may have difficulty relating to the two lead protagonists in Border, a cynical Swedish romantic-fantasy.|Rotten
"""Border"" may not be everyone's idea of a fun night out, but it takes you to places you won't forget, and that's nothing to sniff at."|Fresh
One of the biggest risks Border takes is in the deliberateness with with it slow-walks Tina's journey to self-realization.|Fresh
"The refreshingly offbeat, sturdily handled ""Border"" is not just unlikely to resemble any of its subtitled competition but also anything else you'll see this year."|Fresh
In Tina, she has crafted a central character that's easy to appreciate, and often fascinating, but hard to like, and equally often deliberately off-putting. Which is also a fair description of Border.|Fresh
Explores its boundary-pushing notions in ways that can be bracingly stimulating, even when they aren't always dramatically satisfying.|Fresh
Border is therefore representative of the geographical line separating Tina's native country of Sweden with its neighbors as well as the one between nature and nurture.|Fresh
John Ajvide Lindqvist's new film is a dark, twisted fairy tale that is worth watching so long as you know that it's no Disney fable-and it is definitely not for children.|Fresh
As cold as possible is a good way to see it. This is a movie that aims to startle in overt and subtextual ways; the less known before viewing, the better.|Fresh
Just when you think you've seen it all, along comes Border.|Fresh
While the film does take some twists and turns - some fairly contrived - it mostly drills down and explores her emotional conundrum without drawing symbolic conclusions about the world we live in.|Fresh
Border's hyper-realistic aesthetic combined with jaw-dropping, phenomenal performances is cinema magic at its best.|Fresh
It's creepy and disturbing and freaky, with enough room to find whatever subtext you're looking for.|Fresh
"An intriguing gender bender incorporating horror and mythology, something like ""Beauty and the Beast"" though a more apt title would be ""Beast and the Beast."""|Fresh
Melander's performance is remarkable. Director and co-writer Ali Abbasi brilliantly conjures an unlikely eroticism as Vore literally sniffs out Tina's desire...|Fresh
Like the title suggests, Border lives on the edge of several genres while exploring new territories within the realms of love, beauty, and morality to convey what truly sets one apart from being a man or a monster.|Fresh
It's a wonderfully weird often surprising movie that is utterly Scandinavian to its bones, but also surprisingly Hollywood in its narrative commitment to the procedural genre.|Fresh
Border Gr√§ns is a stunningly original magical realist Swedish fable that opens up a window into a different, unseen world.|Fresh
The film's investment into mythology and character depth will satisfy genre fans who are looking to watch a drama and romance with a marked twist.|Fresh
This supernatural romantic thriller constantly shifts genres, but its slow burn approach keeps things intriguing. Abbasi establishes and maintains an unusual, internal logic that will satisfy viewers who go along with every strange twist.|Fresh
All of these [unusual] elements fit perfectly into this contemporary yet unconventional fantasy that also incorporates a mystery box and surprising proposal.|Fresh
...the picture benefits substantially from Melander's hypnotic turn as the oddball central character...|Fresh
If there's another movie like Border, I haven't seen it - or maybe the world can only accommodate one of these.|Fresh
Instead, it betrays a lack of faith in the familiarity of the Other, something that might have given lasting resonance to what is otherwise an initially intriguing but finally self-consciously distinctive curio.|Rotten
Ali Abbasi creates the grimmest of faerie tales as two outcasts find love in a hopeless place in this wild, wonderful, surprisingly emotional drama.|Fresh
Gr√§ns hits its peak in the scenes between Melander and Milonoff. Off-the-charts chemistry between them offers thrills, chills and the real romance of another person helping you to let rip.|Fresh
A film worth it's value in the risks that it takes and easily identifiable for ferocious fans of genre cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The [mix of genres] may seem delirious and, in fact, it does not hide its openly fantastic dimension... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Border ‚Äã‚Äãcould be nonsense but it's not. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
An exciting, intelligent mix of romance, Nordic noir, social realism, and supernatural horror that defies and subverts genre conventions.|Fresh
Without wanting to give too much away there is a provocative banging of heads when it comes to political ideology and amid all the horror and outrage Gr”ìns unexpectedly summons up a generous spirit.|Fresh
[It] builds out such an unusual premise that it risks devolving into quirky inanity, but Abbasi grounds the narrative in an emotional foundation even as it flies off the rails.|Fresh
Border succeeds as gripping drama, mostly on the strength of its two lead performances, both doing sterling work under heavy silicon masks that required four hours of make-up to apply.|Fresh
It is mesmerising in its initial oddness and develops into a complex, richly satisfying piece of storytelling in which all the seemingly jagged, awkward edges eventually fit smoothly together.|Fresh
