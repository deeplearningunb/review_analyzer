The sort of understated, under-the-radar drama that can use all the help it can get to stand out in an increasingly overcrowded marketplace.|Fresh

Manchester by the Sea may take its time making itself heard, but you can count on it.|Fresh

Affleck gives the sort of crumpled, seething, fully lived-in performance that De Niro and Pacino gave in their primes, and he gets strong support from Michelle Williams, Kyle Chandler and Gretchen Mol.|Fresh

...a portrait of a man who deals with grief by submerging it into the marrow of his bones.|Fresh
It's Affleck's movie to quietly own as layer upon layer of Irish impassivity is stripped away from his visage until the unspeakable can be spoken.|Fresh
Lonergan found the right man in Affleck, standing stony-faced while others weep, his performance a master class in submerged feeling... But it's Williams who stuns, in the course of a single, astonishing dialogue toward the end of the film.|Fresh
Not everything broken, this wise movie reminds us, can be mended.|Fresh

Honest|Fresh
A remarkable drama that seems made to win an Oscar and where the interpretation of Casey Affleck really stands out. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

Manchester by the Sea will almost certainly go down as the most devastating, heart-wrenching drama of 2016.|Fresh
What's all the fuss about?|Rotten
