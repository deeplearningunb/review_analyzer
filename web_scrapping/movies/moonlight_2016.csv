As good as [Hibbert, Sanders and Rhodes] all are, it is Holland who makes the strongest impression, the director's alter ego in guiding this young man towards the light.|Fresh
It's less a story than a collection of moments, which leaves its viewer feeling moved and changed, as if you've spent time in someone else's dreams and woke up understanding who they are.|Fresh

Consider the thin and thick wallops of blue... Blue, blue, electric blue. Lazy blue. Electrified blue. Wash of water. Ice-blue buzz of fluorescence. Azul, azure, lapis lazuli, teal, turquoise, sea, seafoam, sky, cerulean, cobalt...|Fresh
