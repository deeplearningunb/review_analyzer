A sometimes heavy-handed, but nonetheless powerful tale of poverty and adversity.|Fresh
Capernaum is not an easy watch, but it is a beautiful one, despite how grisly it can seem at times.|Fresh
This film works so well because of the terrific work by the actors, especially Al Rafeea as Zain, who is thoroughly believable as a 12-year-old desperate to control his own destiny...|Fresh
Capernaum will take a top spot in my list for the best films I've seen and will never watch again.|Fresh
Simultaneously sensitive and straightforward in her directorial methods, Labaki articulates the moral complexities of the subject matter with an equal share of fascination and depression.|Fresh
A good child actor is hard to find, but in Capernaum director Nadine Labaki has improbably found a troupe of them.|Fresh
A depressing but very necessary film, Capharnaüm deals head-on with many of the horrors of modern times.|Fresh
One could argue Capernaum comes dangerously close to poverty porn. Another might respond that the film's grim situations are drawn from real-life situations.|Fresh
Nadine Labaki's extraordinary neorealist film left me gutted, and grateful to be allowed such an emotional response.|Fresh

Nadine Labaki's extraordinary neorealist film left me gutted, and grateful to be allowed such an emotional response.|Fresh
Jail and courtroom scenes, at the beginning and end, may be a tad implausible, not to mention scrappy. But the middle section, mostly shot on handheld cameras on the streets of Beirut, is breathtaking, topical, hilarious, tender and brutal.|Fresh
Labaki's ability with these non-professional actors, including the baby, is remarkable.|Fresh
Capernaum's odyssey, in which Zain battles the hazards of shantytowns, souks, prisons and betrayals with wily, angry energy, paints him as a resourceful figure fighting impossible odds rather than the passive child victim of charity adverts.|Fresh
Both the oppressive family context of Zain as his journey after the abandonment of his home suffer from a complex look, lie in provocations, and point out responsibilities that end up being fallacious and limited. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Capernaum is a rare movie that inspires even as it confronts the horrors its characters inflict on one another.|Fresh
[Labaki] never shows us the worst abuse in Zain's underworld, instead giving the piece emotional force through a crushing build-up of everyday incident.|Fresh
Feel-good fare it most certainly is not -- but as an example of cinema's power to face uncomfortable real-life truths, look no further.|Fresh
Rafeea, a non-professional actor and Syrian refugee, is the film's secret weapon. At times, the tragedy unfolding on screen feels borderline unwatchable, but his strange, fascinating, eerily adult face offers a litany of minute expressions.|Fresh
A clunky, hanky-dampening mechanism is lost in a dazzling collision of social commentary, brash characterisation and coal-black humour.|Fresh
At times a savage watch, Capernaum is a film that rewards those capable of stomaching its darker edges with some real catharsis.|Fresh
Labaki is so skilled at directing children here.|Fresh
It's harsh and abrasive, and sometimes difficult...but Labaki has layered the film with just enough moments of kindness to break your heart.|Fresh
Harrowing and heartbreaking, a nightmare dystopia that could almost be a documentary. This tough but essential film slyly asks us to consider what we owe children, not just our own but the world's.|Fresh
An important story, powerfully told but problematic at the same time. Worth watching? Definitely.|Fresh
I loved every minute of this movie, which seems largely improvised, yet is brilliantly crafted by director and co-writer Nadine Labaki.|Fresh
A film dominated by guilt and dictated by political correction with a well-intentioned message. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Labaki found her actors on the street, living the lives they portray on screen, and the film is a mission statement.|Fresh
Nadine Labaki's film is frantic, fast, full of colour and feeling and bursts of raw humour. It's not a perfect film, but it is a fine one.|Fresh
Though it over-eggs some aspects (and makes questionable use of a toddler in one of the subplots), it feels true to the heightened perspective of its protagonist.|Fresh
[Director Nadine] Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead.|Fresh
The complacent outcome does not detract from story's... accomplishment. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Labaki directs the inexperienced cast sensitively, and mixes appalled commentary on the bureaucracy conspiring against the disenfranchised with the occasional indelible image.|Fresh
Zain Alrafeea's charisma and the sharp direction from Nadine Labaki elevate the film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Magnificent but harrowing.|Fresh
[Capernaum] deserves to be seen and appreciated. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Capernaum is for fans of Slumdog Millionaire, not Pather Panchali: neorealism with bells on. Some scenes, even so, scar us and stay with us.|Fresh
Deep breathing is required to get you through some of the movie's tougher scenes but, as a whole, it's a testimony to human resilience and the astonishing power of hope.|Fresh
The lives that Labaki portrays are too often treated as scrolling buzzwords in faceless news reports, but receive a sweepingly sensitive treatment here.|Fresh
With two astonishing child performances, Capernaum is a real heart-breaker. It can make Ken Loach look happy-go-lucky but it's a gripping, sympathetic cry for the dispossessed.|Fresh
Capernaum seems to punish the parents' behavior more than the miserable situation in which they are immersed. The latter is a defect to be taken into account, but it does not tarnish what the film achieves emotionally. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A decent performance from Zain Al Rafeea, but the film is hectoring, contrived and simplistic.|Rotten
Propelled by a seething sense of injustice, it fuses expert storytelling with a striking cinematic sensibility to take the viewer on a gripping, highly emotional journey through life on the streets of Beirut.|Fresh
A narrative that openly directs itself to your feelings and the sensibility of anyone who sees its images. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Sad and humbling as most of Labaki's respectful story becomes, one final, full-screen image of Zain offers us hope that her hero -- and certainly ours -- might discover a life as just a little boy.|Fresh
Al-Rafeea is the driving force of this movie... He makes the struggles seem real -- a mere child asked to do things that even adults shouldn't be asked to do.|Fresh
This is one of the most anxiety inducing portraits of infancy I have seen in a long time. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Capernaum illustrates not just an indifferent world, but a hypocritical one as well. And it answers over and over again the question of why forgotten people are so rarely able to play by society's rules.|Fresh
It is not an easy watch, but if you take a chance on it, you'll be rewarded with one of the most remarkable films of the year.|Fresh
The raw and staggering performance Lebanese director/co-writer Nadine Labaki is able to pull from non-professional child actor Zain Al Rafeea in the Academy Award-nominated drama Capernaum is gut-wrenching. It's something that can't be taught.|Fresh
'Capernaum' is a brutal and hard movie to digest; it also is a harder movie to forget.|Fresh
In young Al Rafeea, a real-life Syrian transplant and first-time actor found on the streets of Beirut, Labaki has found the perfect vessel to express her views on the refugee experience.|Fresh
[A] gritty, uncompromising look at life on the mean streets of Beirut through the eyes of a child hardened by his experiences.|Fresh
"Calling it a ""good film"" seems incongruous, given the tragic subject matter. But other words come to mind: wondrous, stunning, strangely and irrationally beautiful. A movie that forces you to see the invisible children on the fringe of society."|Fresh
It's like Lion if Lars von Trier made it. The two turns from the child actors at its center are supernaturally strong, but it becomes too didactic for its own good. Overall, it's a well-meaning film that's too insistent in the wrong areas.|Fresh
Capernaum is worth the price of admission just for Zain Al Rafeea's wonderful performance alone.|Fresh
A thorough melodrama that will move even the most indifferent person. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Powerful, beautiful and necessary. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Labaki shows that she is a talented and brave filmmaker. Taking this story she co-wrote and using a cast made up of non-actors, Labaki has made a film which is full of questions and compassion leaving judging to lesser others.|Fresh
[Director Nadine Labaki] paints a multi-faceted portrait of life among Beirut's underclass.|Fresh
It is an epic of messianic cinema and a tale of brutality, with impeccable performances. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Yes, this is grim stuff. Fortunately, director Labaki found a natural and charismatic young actor in the untrained Zain Al Rafeea.|Fresh
Zain Al Rafeea gives one of those indelible child performances, showing the tough street-kid exterior while allowing the frightened vulnerability to show through.|Fresh
Capernaum marks a tremendous step forward for filmmaker Nadine Labaki...|Fresh
Without ever patronising or degrading, Capernaum brims with charm and sheer love for life while still managing to portray life on the breadline in all its rough-and-ready horror and volatility.|Fresh
Capernaum is heartbreaking.|Fresh
Capharnaüm is filmmaking with a big heart, a caring conscience and a belligerent belief that there is still some hope.|Fresh
[Director Nadine] Labaki captures it all (including some heartbreaking and harrowing decisions) with an unblinking camera which will leave you shaken and stirred.|Fresh
It's so full of life and motion, it's fit to burst.|Fresh
Labaki's film is an eye-opener - a seemingly authentic exploration of the world of the dispossessed of Lebanon's capital city, made by a director who is clearly passionate about bringing this particular story to world audiences.|Fresh
It stands as an important entry into the film liturgy on kids who must fight for every scrap of life they can find.|Fresh
Despite the connotations of its title...an exceptionally disciplined piece of work, portraying the brutal realities of life for many, particularly children, in a land racked by political, social and economic turmoil.|Fresh
The dark horse for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar also happens to be the most moving movie of the bunch.|Fresh
The plot of Capernaum can get a bit involved, but the performances from the non-professional cast are captivating...|Fresh
Labaki makes you want to squeeze into Zain's shoes, if just for a couple of hours.|Fresh
[Nadine] Labaki's filmmaking suggests uncertainty at best and lack of confidence at worst.|Rotten
Labaki's use of color is effective and subtle, with blues and reds carefully deployed, along with a welcome and valuable sense of humor.|Fresh
"The title translates to ""chaos,"" and chaos is exactly what Nadine Labaki's brutal, unflinching film depicts in boiling down a worldwide crisis to the microcosm of an undocumented 12-year-old Lebanese boy suffering the mean streets of Beirut."|Fresh
"A Cannes Jury Prize-winner, ""Capernaum"" is a triumph."|Fresh
It's like Slumdog Millionaire, but without any of its optimism, and it's all the better for it.|Fresh
This emotionally gripping but flawed work ticks all the checkboxes for a work that festival fans love: a tough social-realist drama centered around a child's point of view.|Fresh
The plight of the powerless - children, the poor, undocumented immigrants - in [Labaki's] home country must be a cause close to her heart because you can feel her passion in every frame of her film.|Fresh
Al Rafeea and Shiferaw ground Labaki's empathetic story in beautifully natural performances.|Fresh
Capernaum is an immersive film that you can't shake about a child that everyone else has forgotten.|Fresh
There's something gut-wrenchingly effective about a child-in-peril movie... But if that nail-biting tension is too much, be warned: Capernaum will have you chewing your fingers off.|Fresh
Labaki's direction, paired with the outstanding and moving portrayals by Zain Al Rafeea and Yordanos Shiferaw...results in a gut-wrenching, intimate, and empathetic film.|Fresh
Labaki shows us, in granular, street-level detail - using mostly non-professional actors, many of whom are refugees themselves - what life looks like for the unprotected.|Fresh
Capernaum is an absolute heartbreaker about children in peril and the plight of undocumented people.|Fresh
Labaki does beautiful work with her nonprofessional cast, most of whom are refugees, and her non-chronological structure builds unhurried suspense into the travails of Zain.|Fresh
A contemporary Arabic-language Oliver Twist, Capernaum is a movie with a surfeit of tragedy and plot-points, worthy of a miniseries, squeezed into a two-hour sausage of misery.|Fresh
One of the most unsettling films of the year, and its based on the filmmaker's observations and experiences in the city's slums. A seismic expression of life for some of the world's children.|Fresh
"Labaki chose the title ""Capernaum"" because the word was often used to mean ""chaos"" in French literature. That's precisely what she presents to us, with precious little relief in sight."|Fresh
It is simultaneously a rallying cry and a hymn of persistence: a strong drama that provokes the audience to think while showing a glimmer of hope that does not feel forced.|Fresh
Labaki's lens is so patient and empathic, her knack for storytelling so full of soul and temerity, that we're inclined to follow her lead.|Fresh
...this film will have you in tears by the time that the credits finish rolling.|Fresh
Capernaum makes the 2018 critics' favorite Shoplifters look like an afternoon at Disneyland.|Fresh
"Capernaum, which roughly translates to ""chaos,"" is a deeply empathetic movie, made all the more remarkable by Labaki's work with non-professional actors."|Fresh
...a tough watch, but it is also an incredibly impressive piece of truth-telling cinema.|Fresh
It's a rewarding and well-made arthouse film.|Fresh
Despite an occasional bit of heavy-handedness, the film credibly and grippingly looks at poverty, child neglect, refugees and ID-card insanity.|Fresh
Kudos to Labaki for going out there and bringing this story to us.|Fresh
"Real life is ""Capernaum's"" supposed target, but the filmmakers exhaust most of their energy squeezing plot beats into place."|Rotten
Capernaum may be a flawed portrait of the voiceless masses whose daily lives mock all the lofty ideals of the state it portrays, but its rallying cry demands to be heard nonetheless.|Fresh
This contrast results in bursts of humor, recalling the likes of Slumdog Millionaire and The Florida Project. But Capernaum is a darker watch than either.|Fresh
Labaki's excellent film is tough sledding - a sucker punch that lands with the emotional force of Dickens relocated to the slums of the modern-day Middle East.|Fresh
Viewers are thereby hooked, and the Lebanese director Nadine Labaki keeps them that way throughout a picaresque journey through the streets and hovels and storefronts and sordid domestic dramas that provide her film's physiology.|Fresh
These pains somehow don't feel exploitative or gratuitous-there is a nuanced matter-of-factness even in Labaki's empathy that prevents it to ever become pity.|Fresh
Something must be done, but it's never clear if Labaki and her fellow screenwriters ... have an idea as to what that something might be.|Rotten
Lebanese filmmaker Nadine Labaki brings an undeniable emotional pull to this harrowing portrait of a poverty-stricken child's fight to survive in the slums of Beirut.|Fresh
It's a fairy tale and an opera, a potboiler and a news bulletin, a howl of protest and an anthem of resistance.|Fresh
There's no reprieve from the extreme poverty that fuels Zain's parents's abuses or that drives Rahil to risk everything to care for her child. Sadness isn't just around every corner of this film; it is in the viewer's face throughout its runtime.|Fresh
Powerful, gritty Lebanese drama shows kids in danger.|Fresh
The cast is simply astonishing.|Fresh
The film amounts to a series of easy emotional lay-ups, devoid of any psychological nuance or challenging inflection.|Rotten
Labaki depicts underworld barbarity, official indifference, and the crushing weight of traditional misogyny through Zain's ferociously intelligent, deeply principled perspective.|Fresh
[Director Nadine] Labaki is not without her glosses and her storytelling can be clunky, but the film is graced with many seemingly peripheral moments that nevertheless hit home.|Fresh
Zain Al Rafeea's naturalness, however uncanny, only makes the film's maneuverings seem all the more obvious.|Rotten
"Given its stark visuals, its authentic acting by non professionals, and its humanism, ""Capernaum"" has become the obvious entry by Lebanon to our Academy Awards."|Fresh
All of this brilliance stems from the brilliant script from Labaki. One part 'The Florida Project' and one part struggle for survival, Labaki's work shines.|Fresh
Alrafeea is a revelation as the energetic, foul-mouthed Zain, beautifully delivering a spontaneous energy that feels as though its plucked right off the streets moments before the cameras roll.|Fresh
A wonderfully complex and rich coming of age story that doesn't sugar coat the reality of life for those on the fringes of society.|Fresh
Labaki's realistic camera following Zain, whose family is undocumented migrants, takes viewers into the heart of a very real, universal issue, no, not about refugees, but the problem of unfit parenting.|Fresh
The last shot had me choking back sobs.|Fresh
Labaki ... keeps the plot moving quickly through its most distressing parts, always able with image and sound to keep us intently focused on what we need to see.|Fresh
A disgusting act of film vanity disguised as a social conscience. Cinema is not nourished by heroes, but by ideas and art. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
It's a scathing commentary on the effects of poverty, the failure to properly respond to refugee crises, and simple human decency populated by those struggling just as much as the next yet have also crossed a line they cannot return from.|Fresh
Her frank depiction of unseemly behaviour is heartbreakingly real, her tireless humanism a constant presence.|Fresh
Such escapades will eventually fill undiscerning art-house patrons with a warm glow and leave them none the wiser concerning Beirut's mean streets.|Rotten
It's easy to place a camera on a sad child and immediately generate sympathy - this isn't a film as much as it's a two hour infomercial for your local church's outreach program.|Rotten
It's a tear-jerker, all right -- but then, it's hard to see how it could remain true to reality and be anything else.|Fresh
Despite an awkwardly didactic climax, the results are grueling and powerful.|Fresh
"In the end, ""Capernaum"" is a film that will have two sides. Those who will love it unconditionally, and those who will feel repulsion for a supposed emotional manipulation. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
The film contains some outstanding performances by children (including a toddler!) and it's undeniably going straight for the heartstrings.|Fresh
Capernaum will have you in floods of tears.|Fresh
A social-realist blockbuster - fired by furious compassion and teeming with sorrow, yet strewn with diamond-shards of beauty, wit and hope.|Fresh
Labaki piles on the sentimentality, seemingly unaware that the inherently harrowing premise is reason enough to care.|Rotten
Some will find the film's politics belaboured, but Labaki has earned the right, with her fully evidenced inquiry into destitution, to ram points home.|Fresh
It's a deeply assured piece of direction, and though it only plays a few emotional notes, they are ones that won't soon leave your memory.|Fresh
The kind of social-issue sadness pile that confuses nonstop hardship for drama, begging for our tears at every moment.|Rotten
It is, therefore, an aesthetic manipulation of a dramatic social picture, which reveals a more than questionable view of its materials by the director... [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Every emotion is negated by another, until we're left with nothing but the mess we were presented from the start. Capernaum, indeed.|Rotten
It's a much angrier, tougher - and sometimes funnier - film than you might imagine from its cloying opening premise.|Fresh
A film that chooses raw dramatic power over narrative finesse.|Fresh
Not subtle, but stirring.|Fresh
While this is unquestionably an issue film, it tackles its subject with intelligence and heart.|Fresh
