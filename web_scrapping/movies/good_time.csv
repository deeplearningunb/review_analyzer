Good Time seems destined to be a cult classic. It's carried off with such a dazzling intent, and it's got real dramatic ingenuity to go with its more obvious focus on ambience|Fresh
Good Time represents a shift for [Pattinson], who turns in his best and most singular performance in this gritty underbelly thriller from the Safdie brothers.|Fresh
Good Time has a neon color scheme that is hypnotic and intoxicating, a hallucinatory palate that can shift into a bad trip at a moment's notice.|Fresh
I'm in awe of what the Safdies achieve here, which is neo-noir (neon-noir?) and social realism mulched into a decayed panic attack.|Fresh
An aesthetically nostalgic crime thriller with a career changing performance by Pattinson and an effective direction from the Safdie brothers.|Fresh
It's a nonstop, adrenalin-fuelled night of bad decisions getting worse, its urgency nodding to Dog Day Afternoon or After Hours. But it's also implicit in incidental social and psychological comment.|Fresh
Good Time isn't an exuberant or happy-go-lucky emotional ride, rather it's the cruel irony of white privileged in even the lowest rungs of class.|Fresh
"""Good Time"" really isn't a good time at the movies. But it's worth watching to see a cold-eyed, street-level deconstruction of a night - and life - of crime."|Fresh
Good Time certainly puts the audience through an anxious time as Connie goes on a desperate odyssey through the night streets trying to put things right.|Fresh
"By the end of ""Good Time,"" you might well find yourself begging for a less successfully realistic film, for it is so effectively rendered that you will experience a lifetime of hardships right along with Pattinson and his unfortunate cohorts."|Rotten

It tries far too hard to be rough around the edges, but it's rather devoid of emotion. Pattinson is good, but his performance never elevates the film.|Rotten
The social commentary that runs throughout especially on people on the fringes of society and the harsher treatment people of colour suffer is well done with a lightness of touch that allows the viewer to reflect rather than feel manipulated...|Fresh
Relentless and intoxicating, Good Time is a manic and devious exploration of greed. It skewers a particular grifter persona that thrives on uncertainty and sabotage, someone who looks in the mirror and mistakes guilt for good intentions.|Fresh
A violently hypnotic street-wise NYC crime thriller.|Fresh
Josh and Benny Safdie have created a masterpiece in Good Time, a film of nerve, audacity, and ugliness that recaptures the cheap and broken energy of color 1970s New York crime movies.|Fresh
Before you grind your teeth reliving the trauma that were the five Twlight movie [Robert Pattinson] previously starred in, he's actually great.|Fresh
Pattinson's Connie is a classic anti-hero, repellent and attractive at the same time: You want him to keep finding an escape hatch, but you also want him to be caught in the end.|Fresh
A great job where form and background are taken almost to perfection. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"I wouldn't say I had a ""good time"" watching this film, but I definitely recommend it to those who want to see an stylised and hypnotising thriller. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Set up almost like a modern-day version of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men - if all the characters in the classic novel were tripping on acid.|Fresh
Filled with striking images, excitingly disorienting action sequences and strong performances, Good Times ... is in many ways a marvel of ... low-budget filmmaking.|Fresh
This is a gorgeous movie about ugly people.|Fresh
The Safdie brothers prefer to entertain and maintain an agile rhythm instead of delving into their characters or their ideas, something that the film would have appreciated very much. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The title might suggest fun - an idea reinforced by the use of an amusement park as a key location - but Good Time concerns a man's frantic and increasingly doomed dash through nocturnal New York to prevent a loved one doing a very different kind of time.|Fresh
The movie is life a party, like a synthetic climax in perpetual boom. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Despite the recognizable elements, everything in Good Time is instinctive, unpredictable and disconcerting. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
... Connie is a fascinating anti-hero. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
One of 2017's most beautiful movies, despite only ever training its gaze on ugly things.|Fresh
The Safdie brothers, despite having a cast of popular actors... manage to retain their independent essence, never giving in to the usual vain whims of stars... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The third feature film by the Safdie brothers takes us through a narrative constellation that expands as we travel through New York. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
What if Abel Ferrara made After Hours? The result would be the jittery, electro-infused New York nightmare Good Time. And that result is a pure cinematic thrill.|Fresh
This crime drama of a bank robber trying to get his brother out of police custody features non-stop improvisation. This is a character worth following, and Robert Pattinson is an actor to watch. Benny Safdie is also a writer and director on the rise.|Fresh
Even a deliberately flat ending escapes criticism, highlighting the brutal naturalism of the piece. The Safdies are following the old adage of always leave them wanting more, which is exactly what you want after a Good Time.|Fresh
The ticking clock thriller gets an indie makeover and the result is a pulse-quickening ride that, in entertainment value, beats anything that mainstream cinema has made in a while.|Fresh
It never feels terribly organic, but it is consistently entertaining, even as it gets increasingly violent. And the driving theme of brotherly love gives the film an unexpected emotional soul.|Fresh
There is a jungle out there, and inside every house and every hospital room, that the Heaven Knows What directors know how to combine and conjugate in relation to the protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Powerful beyond the stereotypes. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Directors Josh and Benny Safdie are again utilizing heavily synthesized music and electronic beats that propel momentum forward just as kinetically as each character's next, usually bad, choice|Fresh
Nick's character doesn't exactly develop, but we do see its innards teased gradually apart. Ben Safdie's touching performance bookends the film with enormous grace.|Fresh
Lionsgate outfits one of the most original American crime films in ages with a gorgeously gnarly transfer.|Fresh
The film's assuredness of tone, pace and form illustrate clearly the deftness of the direction from Benny and Josh Safdie and mark them out as singular talents.|Fresh
Pattinson nails a back-breaking role and the Safdies direct with an unrelenting visceral edge.|Fresh
The plot may be circular, but the rhythm of the film, edited down to a lean 101 minutes and driven by the surging synth riffs of Daniel Lopatin's score, is one of urgent forward momentum.|Fresh
With a style harking back to early Scorsese, the film teases out a bloody terrific turn from Pattinson ...|Fresh
Pattinson is utterly convincing as the Manson-eyed Connie, a manipulative force of nature (alternately mesmerising, repugnant and pathetic) who leaves a trail of destruction in his wake.|Fresh
This isn't a misleading title. With its adrenaline rush pacing, terrific performances and unpredictable script, this is a film that doesn't stop surprising or entertaining.|Fresh
The masterstroke of the script is how it takes a situation that, in almost any other film of this type, would be played for pathos... and instead strip-mines it for every last iota of moral ambiguity.|Fresh
While it can be argued that things become too far-fetched and skittish in places, the thrill here is that you really don't know what's going to happen next|Fresh
Good Time feels like a throwback to 1970s classics like Mean Streets or Dog Day Afternoon and has a nervous, edgy energy that keeps you on your toes.|Fresh
The urgent docu-style filming is impressive, but it's Pattinson's fearless turn that lingers.|Fresh
It's a sly and vivid dispatch from the struggling margins of Trump's America. And it's Robert Pattinson on peak form, giving a performance of desperate ferocity and trapped intensity.|Fresh
The Safdies' raw documentary aesthetic transforms the film into a tense, uncomfortable exposé of desperate, damaged people unsuccessfully trying to bend the world to their own will.|Fresh
The Safdie brothers' crime thriller Good Time is a chaotic, wildly inventive but increasingly self-indulgent affair.|Fresh
Robert Pattinson finally drives a stake through his image as the moony hunk from Twilight with this convincing, career-shifting performance - his finest to date.|Fresh
Few of the characters have the first idea what might be coming next - nor do we, strapped into this feral shaggy dog story the Safdies have set rolling, hurtling towards their brilliant future.|Fresh
Pattinson plays a blinder in this gripping, gritty grindhouse-meets-arthouse heist movie.|Fresh
An intoxicating downer odyssey.|Fresh
In watching Good Time, you forget that actor Robert Pattinson was ever involved with the Twilight franchise with what is the best performance of his career.|Fresh
It is certainly a good time to be Robert Pattinson. It's hard to think of another young actor who has moved so far - and so fast - away from the long shadow cast by his breakthrough role.|Fresh
Robert Pattinson finally shakes off that Twilight shame with this tense, foul-mouthed and ironically-titled character/crime drama.|Fresh
Good Time follows in the footsteps of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets. The action keeps up a relentless pace as new characters are introduced.|Fresh
It's intriguing, bold, exciting, fresh and urgent ... The first twenty minutes or so are staggering ... The original score, by Oneohtrix Point Never, is creepy, evocative and the best of the year thus far.|Fresh
Electricity pulses through the film - amped by Daniel Lopatin's grand slabs of retro-futurist synth - which also recalls the inventiveness and physicality of silent cinema comics like Buster Keaton.|Fresh
... Good Time always leaves just enough room between the dramatics for the characters to reveal their humanity.|Fresh
Getting big stars on screen and giving them such dark, meaty roles has amply paid off.|Fresh
How good is Pattinson here? Scary good. De-Niro-in-the-1970s-good.|Fresh
Good Time isn't just nerve-wracking because Connie's scattershot schemes keep blowing up in his face; it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how the Safdies even got this footage.|Fresh
It's to Pattinson's credit that you slowly start to realise that Nick's absolute belief in Connie is an ongoing act of affirmation that the latter needs. Connie's love is laced with self-interest.|Fresh
An enjoyably grimy, 80s-infused, Queens-set crime thriller about a bank robber busting his gut to free his incarcerated brother.|Fresh
The film never lets up, pushing and pushing and pushing the viewer into Connie's deeply messed up world.|Fresh
But this isn't Edward Cullen; this is Connie Nikas. He's the manipulative, selfish, absolutely electric antagonist of a movie that will bury itself under my skin just as much as that one scene did.|Fresh
At the heart of this off-balance heist movie is a story of brotherly love.|Fresh
Often challenging and uncomfortable to watch, the ironically titled Good Time is a feverish head trip that seizes you by the throat and refuses to let go.|Fresh
It is not just a Good Time for Pattinson, but a perfect moment for genre and movie stars (and directors like the Safdies) to explore new possibilities.|Fresh
Forget Twilight and Kristin Stewart romance rigamarole. Those days are done. Pattinson's take on a Queens dirtbag with an adrenal gland on overload proves he's the real deal.|Fresh
Good Time is thrillingly alive, both hard to look at but impossible to turn away from.|Fresh
One of the best films of 2017.|Fresh
A distinctive head rush that pairs a handful of refreshingly earnest performances with a great sense of style.|Fresh
"If at the height of ""Twilight"" mania you had told me one day I would compare vampire-in-chief Robert Pattinson with young Al Pacino, I would have driven a wooden stake through your heart. But guess what? That day has arrived."|Fresh
It is [Robert] Pattinson who shines. Once a vampire hunk, he has grown into the kind of actor the camera loves - even if preteen girls no longer will.|Fresh
I like Good Time a lot. What I don't like is the title.|Fresh
With his dead-on outer-borough accent and sleepless, thousand-yard stare, Pattinson is utterly convincing as someone who, despite all his heavy lifting, we never come to care about.|Fresh
In his monstrous compulsion to lure others into his schemes, drain them of resources, and cast them aside, Connie's the first real vampire that Robert Pattinson has played.|Fresh
A somewhat ironic title for a sweaty, panicky, crime caper focused on a bad guy, but the sleazy thrills do have entertainment value.|Fresh
What follows is one of those all-night-long odysseys that's taxing for the characters but weirdly fascinating for the viewer (think Martin Scorsese's After Hours or even Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle).|Fresh
Jerry Seinfeld joked that his show was about nothing. Well, now there's a film named Good Time that can keep it company. . .|Rotten
Good Time is a fast-paced, oscillation of raw emotion and manic suspense that plays directly to Pattinson's continually emerging thespian strengths.|Fresh
Narcotically propulsive... a 1970s New York City motion picture in style and energy... Action is character. Energy is unstable. Chronic energy confined is a dangerous force.|Fresh
Far-fetched and feverish, it's been cynically dubbed 'Of Vice and Men,' making a modern-day reference to John Steinbeck's classic 1937 novel about two displaced Depression-era workers.|Rotten
If you can overlook the many problems with Good Time's plot, there are a lot of things to like about it.|Fresh
A propulsive fever dream.|Fresh
We're never quite sure where Good Time is going next, and that's one of its most satisfying traits.|Fresh
Good Time matches the do-anything relentlessness of its lead character, making for one of the most visceral and exciting movie experiences of the year.|Fresh
Good Time isn't helped by the script,|Rotten
"Not so good, really. And once again not so ""real"" either. Cue the shaky cams in their faces. Ugh."|Rotten
The cinematic abomination Good Time is...an unapologetic docu-comedy of low-life, cultural autism...instead of a genre parody, it is hipster neo-realism.|Rotten
Robert Pattinson's commanding lead performance is deserving of praise, but that's about it.|Rotten
I couldn't help feeling like [Good Time] was a missed opportunity.|Rotten
Good Time is the sleazy friend that knows all the best dives.|Fresh
A fever-dream of hand-held close-ups and bold colors.|Fresh
The opening sequence is as jaw droppingly good as Robert Pattinson is for the film's entire running time.|Fresh
The Safdie brothers' film is a dizzyingly entertaining race-against-the-clock thriller and a socially aware urban drama. It never lets up.|Fresh
Set within a thoroughly impoverished layer of New York's urban sprawl, Good Time manages to make the city feel gritty in a way that cinema's rarely captured in recent decades.|Fresh
Good Time is thematically spare, but the savvy, energetic direction of the Safdie brothers and Pattinson's wide-eyed, intense performance keep it afloat.|Fresh
Compelling and impressive as it can be, Good Time left me mulling whether it shouldn't be tagged with a little bit of that label|Fresh
You have to go back into the vaults -- maybe as far back as Dog Day Afternoon -- to find a movie about a New York bank robber more intense than Benny and Josh Safdie's ironically titled drama Good Time.|Fresh
Good Time isn't concerned with conspiracy plot details or capers; it's an outlaw bender.|Fresh
[Good Time] is sharp, flashy filmmaking that enthralls increasingly with each turn of the downward spiral.|Fresh
. . . incessant hustling and crackbrained scheming makes Good Time into an undeniably riveting spectacle.|Fresh
The tense and twisty crime caper Good Time is not only a low-budget thriller that out-thrills most of this year's Hollywood offerings, it's also anchored by a performance that would be star-making if its actor wasn't already a star.|Fresh
"The good things about Good Time is the chaotic, gritty character study at its center and a breakout performance by Robert Pattinson that proves there is no ""Twilight"" to this actor's career."|Fresh
With Good Time, the Safdie brothers have flaunted their gritty bona fides.|Fresh
Just when you think that's where Good Time is going, it zags.|Fresh
[Hoffman is] no Pacino or Hoffman but he's more than good enough opting for a performance from their playbook.|Fresh
Crackles with nervous energy and uneasy laughs.|Fresh
... inventively plotted by the Safdies and Ronald Bronstein, throwing obstacles in Connie's way with underworld credibility.|Fresh
A grueling viewing experience, but an exceptional one, nudged along by star Robert Pattinson's career-shifting performance.|Fresh
Pattinson is what helps us keep pace. He completely inhabits Connie with his jittery, twitchy efforts - he can't stand still, so neither can we.|Fresh
Eventually, Connie gets what's coming to him, but not before alienating everyone around him, including the audience.|Rotten
Another intense, convulsive Safdie exercise in urban nihilism, buoyed by a take-no-prisoners turn by an almost unrecognizable Robert Pattinson.|Fresh
Pattinson keeps you interested, even when the movie's tone and pace wobbles.|Fresh
(Robert Pattinson's Connie) is a pathetic mop of a man who always seems to be reaching for something - even if he does not know what that is.|Fresh
It's mean, all right-also myopic, pitiless, and deliberately ugly, and it leaves you with no moral. I like it a lot.|Fresh
There is a germ of a good idea here - a story that starts forward with the familiar elements of heist movies and underdog stories, then throws the whole thing in reverse and accelerates madly in unexpected directions.|Rotten
An engaging journey to the dark side, thanks to Robert Pattinson's lead turn, which adds a layer of emotional resonance to what ends up an uncommonly intriguing crime drama.|Fresh
Good Time is a rousing but shallow bit of grime crime buoyed by Pattinson's performance even as it wallows in cliches.|Fresh
It's a genuine thrill, and a big part of it is that the Safdies, and Pattinson, never soften up on Connie's rough edges.|Fresh
Whatever the intentions of the filmmakers, Good Time is a promising but flawed final product.|Fresh
The Safdies and cinematographer Sean Price Williams immerse you in the pressurized scenario with a mix of tight close-ups, handheld camerawork and overhead shots suggesting the viewpoint of a scientist watching a rat traverse a maze.|Fresh
Tense, immersive and excellently assaulting, Good Time is hella time.|Fresh
There's a world of difference between a movie that makes you want to rave about it, and one that feels like you're watching it from inside a rave.|Rotten
If the opening scene grabs you the way that it did me, you'll plug into this gross cesspool of crime, drugs, manipulation and horrible decisions, and you'll roller-coaster ride it to its bitter end. This one is a home run.|Fresh
Pattinson makes Connie one of the best roles of his career by turning a two-bit hood into a loyal family guy driven to help his brother. John Steinbeck would recognize these characters. So would Martin Scorsese, who is thanked in the credits.|Fresh
When Good Time hits its visceral lows, Pattinson keeps the movie from feeling like an exercise in futility, finding something human within a character who's quickly losing himself in an atmosphere of total chaos.|Fresh
Good Time might be a secret morality test for its audience.|Rotten
...despite his reprehensible ways, you want to see Connie save Nick and, together, ride off into the metaphoric sunset.|Fresh
The outer boroughs of New York have rarely been shown as realistically and phantasmagorically within a single movie.|Fresh
What starts out as an invigorating odyssey winds up becoming an enervating series of postures.|Fresh
Not since Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void have I been so mesmerized by a film I found morally repugnant.|Fresh
"Most crime movies, even alleged indies, make it easy for the audience to take sides and establish clear rooting interests. ""Good Time"" is better than that: It's not always easy to take, yet you can't look away."|Fresh
Good Time demonstrates an admirable daring in its technique and willingness to go against the grain, but its payoff isn't equal to its challenges.|Fresh
A pinball series of random criminal misadventures. It carries no message and aims only to keep your attention, even if it has to hit you in the head occasionally with a curveball to do it.|Fresh
Good Time further solidifies Robert Pattinson as one of the most exciting actors working today.|Fresh
Pattinson's performance is indeed flawless, and the breathless thriller built around it is pretty fantastic too.|Fresh
Good Time, is even more lurid, the thrillingly vulgar - and frequently hilarious - saga of another pair of outer-borough siblings.|Fresh
In the end, the whole enterprise comes off as too clever for its own good, a social satire without a clear target. It's a movie that you admire more than you like.|Fresh
A brutal, high-stakes crime film unforgiving in its pace and reminiscent of urban psychodramas of the '70s in its grimy grit.|Fresh
Good Time's inspired style, coupled with Pattinson's compelling performance, are enough to carry the film past its narrative shortcomings.|Fresh
The acting by a mostly amateur cast is over the top, the writing is genuinely ludicrous, and the characters so contrived that the movie defies even the most basic logic.|Rotten
It marks a major stride forward, at once sure-footed in its method and destabilizing in its effect.|Fresh
"We may have not seen the likes of the resulting down and dirty thrill ride since Scorcese's ""After Hours""...Pattinson is mesmerizing in a flawless performance as the conniving, fast-talking Connie."|Fresh
It's a rattling experience, a one-long-night-in-New-York movie that's set in the present but filtered through the scuzzy gaze of the city's past. I kind of loved it.|Fresh
"Good Time is just that and little more, but Robert Pattinson's performance deserves praise like ""career-defining"" and ""best yet."""|Fresh
Good Time observes something primal about the worlds that exist beneath the worlds in which so many other movies are made and viewed.|Fresh
A uniquely exhilarating experience with a sharp, unflinching style and a magnetic performance from Robert Pattinson.|Fresh
This visceral crime thriller benefits from a fully committed performance from Robert Pattinson and a gritty visual texture.|Fresh
Directing brothers Ben Safdie and Joshua Safdie have created an ode to intense 1970s New York crime cinema, but with their own vivid, confined close-up take, bathed in artificial, carnival colors.|Fresh
The Safdie brothers' new movie with Robert Pattinson breathes life into a waning genre.|Fresh
The masterfully scuzzy feel-bad Good Time is the kind of movie that demands consideration for all the post-YA choices Robert Pattinson has been making.|Fresh
Good Time is a movie that can't sit still, and I mean that in the best possible way. There's a palpable sense of anxiety and panic that comes through in every heated frame.|Fresh
Watching Pattinson here, we realize that we've never met this actor before-where has he been?|Fresh
R. Patts dazzles in a darkly funny heist picture that shows just how far a dimwit can get on sex appeal and native cunning.|Fresh
The intensity of Good Time can be credited to the performances, to Daniel Lopatin's often ferocious music and to the directors' decision to frame everything so tightly, while shooting in the equivalent of CinemaScope.|Fresh
It's stale, empty and cold.|Rotten
"At once a swift, relentless chase thriller and an exhilarating mood piece that recalls the great, gritty crime dramas of Sidney Lumet and Abel Ferrara, ""Good Time"" is also exactly what it says it is: a thrill, a blast, a fast-acting tonic of a movie."|Fresh
The film's intensity makes it feel like what we're watching is happening in real time, while the locations and settings drive home the authenticity.|Fresh
Good Time, like so many other films of its ilk, revels in its ugly male characters. The Safdie brothers try to squeeze dark humor from these guys but also seem to have no awareness of how repulsive they've made their lead.|Rotten
With this movie, both Pattinson and the Safdie brothers have broken new ground in their careers; if you haven't been keeping track of what either of them is up to, Good Time would be a good time to start.|Fresh
It's a testament to the Safdies' incredible control as storytellers that neither the genre exercise nor the social commentary detracts from the emotional heft of this film.|Fresh
Plays out like a drug cocktail of Martin Scorsese's After Hours and a Michael Mann-directed acid trip.|Fresh
Pattinson is the real reason to see it: his Connie, wiry and intense, with beady, cracked-out eyes, is the kind of guy you'd cross the street to avoid. But by the movie's end, you realize that his desperation veils a rush of longing.|Fresh
Propelled by a Rob Pattinson tour de force, this Safdie brothers fireball rips through 100 minutes of screen time like Wile E. Coyote with his tail on fire. It comes at you hard so you remember.|Fresh
"If the film doesn't provide the polished power of its various '70s inspirations, in the end ""Good Time"" delivers exactly that."|Fresh
If there's a knock on Good Time, it's that its sheer eagerness for anything unconventional comes at the cost of something deeper. But what a trip it is. Good Time flies by in a rush of neon colors and the throbbing electro score of Oneohtrix Point Never.|Fresh
Following their star's lead, the filmmakers deliver a jet-fueled variation on their usual intricate exploration of New York's marginalized citizens.|Fresh
Good Time is rife with a sense of inequity, which is the secret to why it's so thrilling and a key to why it feels so dangerous.|Fresh
The Safdie Brothers box well outside their weight class with this abrasive crime-thriller.|Rotten
a hallucinogenic late summer treat|Fresh
In an electrifying performance, Robert Pattinson finally shows that he has range beyond that of a brooding, sleepy-eyed vampire.|Fresh
Good Time plays out like a visually arresting episode of COPS, with a series of unusual crimes and police reports all connected by one man perpetually on the lam.|Fresh
"Brotherly love following a botched bank robbery recalls John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men."""|Fresh
The film's dark journey through the night is both candy-colored and scrupulously designed to address how the urban poor interact and negotiate with city services.|Fresh
A good time is all but guaranteed as you watch Benny and Josh Safdie's grubby, energetic heist movie unfold.|Fresh
If Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive was a dream-pop take on the crime thriller, in Good Time the Safdies attempt to drag the throwback fetishism back down to earth.|Fresh
It is somewhat overrated, but not so Pattinson's magnificent work, who finally found a character to manifest his talent. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Robert Pattinson delivers the best performance of his career. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Good Time never loses its commitment to delirium and narrative power. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ben and Joshua Safdie smash the prevailing aestheticism in the official section with Good Time. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film that evokes a certain eighties cinema, without falling into the trap of nostalgia. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Good Time works as an overwhelming stylistic game that starts from a miserable vision of New York to go progressively towards a kind of great guignol. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
If the film is seen as what it really is (an energetic show of genre cinema) can be fully enjoyed without any prejudice. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's in parts a heist movie and a chase movie, but not an homage in any sense, more an evolution, like a 21st century fast-food hybrid.|Fresh
This layered, detailed approach translates to all facets of Good Time. It's a movie born into existence through true collaboration. It's clear the Safdie brothers are beyond substantive storytellers; they're astute delegators.|Fresh
Good time indeed.|Fresh
A story with psychological pretensions, excessively shabby characters, silly situations, capriciously filmed with exhausting close-ups, jamming music. [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
Good time is, in a feverish straight line, a thriller sunk into the blackest of a black city. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It courses with such adrenaline that the tension seldom sags.|Fresh
The film received a six-minute standing ovation at Cannes. We concur.|Fresh
Robert Pattinson offers up his most accomplished performance to date.|Fresh
Pattinson finally bursts out of the chrysalis of his pin-up boy celebrity. The metamorphosis from YA heartthrob into electrifying character actor is complete.|Fresh
Pattinson makes you root for his character from the start.|Fresh
It's Pattinson here who manages to centre and save it, stripping himself free of artificial mannerism and working beautifully with the non-professionals bulking out the cast.|Fresh
The film is a nice resume line for all involved, a technical feat that announces the arrival of talents both new and newly recontextualized. If only all that solid stuff had a stronger gravity to it.|Rotten
Good Time combines anarchic sensibilities with an exacting style, its loopy plot starting in dark places and heads into willfully absurd directions before doubling back to a wakeup call.|Fresh
Features a strong performance from the criminally underrated Robert Pattinson.|Fresh
Robert Pattinson is tremendous. He completely dominates the film and is in virtually every scene.|Fresh
Good Time is a film about a destructive love - and loving someone despite not having the right kind of love to give them. Ignore the deceptively convivial title: This is the kind of thrill that sticks.|Fresh
The film is at its strongest when it keys its intoxicating aesthetic to Robert Pattinson's performance.|Fresh
Pattinson shines as Connie: grubby, compromised, smart and charming but ultimately unable to shake his own sordid meanness.|Fresh
"An anthemic, youthful blast of generational pop art, ""Good Time"" is a 100 minute-long string of fire emojis, that begins and ends with a heart."|Fresh
This eyes-open-to-the-world NYC crime thriller is cocky, grubby and electric.|Fresh
It is a sombre, downbeat movie whose initial thrills give way to sadness.|Fresh
This is a richly textured genre piece that packs a visceral charge in its restless widescreen visuals and adrenalizing music, which recalls the great mood-shaping movie scores of Tangerine Dream.|Fresh
Merges the Safdies' signature gutter realism with tight genre mechanics to discomfiting but exhilarating effect.|Fresh
