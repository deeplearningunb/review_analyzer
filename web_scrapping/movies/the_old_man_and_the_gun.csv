The Old Man & the Gun is a light-hearted and delightful crime caper; a charming ode to legends and how we remember them|Fresh
You don't have to be a bank robber or someone who engages in criminal activity to relate to Tucker's story. It's a human story, and a lovely one at that.|Fresh
A film that is almost never made anymore, but thank goodness there's still a few. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The great thing about this film is we get to focus on his face and we get to remember all of his moments.|Fresh

The Old Man & the Gun is seen with a constant smile throughout. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Old Man and the Gun isn't here to rock the boat, but to give you a mug of something warm to drink by a fire. It may not be great, but good, in this case, is just fine.|Fresh
It's like an undiscovered classic Sydney Pollack might have knocked out sometime between Jeremiah Johnson and Tootsie.|Fresh
David Lowery's film is an exciting but always vitalistic swan song for Redford. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh

David Lowery's film is an exciting but always vitalistic swan song for Redford. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
While it has a few truly delightful and memorable scenes, I'd also like to see a version that is a smidge less in awe of its subject, however deserved that awe may be.|Fresh
A light-as-a-feather ride that plays best as a homage to one of the screen's great stars... There's no question this is Redford's movie. Lowery allows him room to put that wry charm to full effect; only Sissy Spacek can keep up.|Fresh
[A] beautiful swan song from one of the greats. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
With twinkle in his eye and wry smile still melting all kinds of hearts, Redford presents his Forrest Tucker as a criminal whose cold and calculated precision to his craft is matched by the warmth of his personality.|Fresh
This is a sweet yet simple film, and that's all it really needs to be.|Fresh
The witty dialogue between Redford and Spacek feels refreshingly romantic, with Lowery abdicating of typical clichés in favor of a tangible honesty...|Fresh
David Lowery's cinematic farewell to one of the greatest living movie stars, Robert Redford, is an utter delight in every conceivable way.|Fresh
A touching, moralistic ode to the solitude of outsiders. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A gorgeous and entertaining ode to not just one cinema legend, but two.|Fresh
Robert Redford possesses something truly powerful as an actor and moves with great security in his craft. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The whole film is full of details that call not so much the celebration of memory as the constancy of time itself. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Director David Lowery continues his win streak with a slickly made movie with great performances|Fresh
Even if it doesn't end up being Redford's last role... it's the best swan song imaginable for him. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Worth it for Redford's swan song.|Fresh
Makes a fitting postscript to one of Redford's best-loved films, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid (1969).|Fresh
Redford couldn't have picked a better final curtain; The Old Man & the Gun is a charming homage to a certain era of film and Americana.|Fresh
Moderately entertaining.|Fresh
A late in the game montage is a crafty excuse to re-examine Redford's career.|Fresh
You couldn't get a better actor than Robert Redford to portray the based-on-fact thief Forrest Tucker in David Lowery's The Old Man & the Gun.|Fresh
The cinematography is casually elegant, its pace is slow-moving, and its plot has a deep touch of humanity.|Fresh
Sometimes, premeditated or not, there are moments of extreme, delicate, and harmonious perfection. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A compelling crime caper with Redford still delivering the goods and a filmmaker perfectly content letting him steal the show one final time.|Fresh
In The Old Man & the Gun, Lowery discovers his warmest shade of nostalgia yet, tinted with just a hint of thoughtful ambivalence.|Fresh
[A] meditative and thought-provoking look at mortality, commitment and people's penchant for chasing something they might never catch.|Fresh
Redford deserves more from the script and direction, as does the audience.|Rotten
It's so squarely the Redford show that the fact he's playing a real-life career criminal, Forrest Tucker, is curiously by-the-by.|Fresh
While this may not go down in history as one of Redford's greatest films, it's filled with iconic shots, a great soundtrack, and bittersweet, award-worthy performances.|Fresh
Every time Forrest and Jewel go into one of their love chats -- in tight close-up, to go along with the grainy '70s-style cinematography -- the movie slows down a little more. By the end, it's barely breathing.|Rotten
Redford is such a charmer, the thief he plays can easily get you to root for him to succeed.|Fresh
Redford modestly, yet effortlessly has us fall for his character, a loveable rogue whose heart has stayed in the right place in spite of a lifetime running on the wrong side of the law.|Fresh
The chemistry between Redford and Spacek's lights up the screen with the sizzle and crackle of a prescribed Midwestern burn. It was a pleasure to watch the film legends bounce tender moments off each other.|Fresh
This is smart, big-hearted entertainment for grown-ups. Beyond that, it's a worthy send-off to one of the greats-if indeed it really is his send-off.|Fresh
This is wholesome goodness fed by the spoonful.|Fresh
Bringing the curtain down on a grand career, The Old Man & the Gun is a fitting finale in every way and is as enjoyable as Redford is charming and smooth throughout.|Fresh
An unreserved, mellow triumph that soothes the soul.|Fresh
[The film] has the crackle and warmth of a fireside ballad, with a touch of poetry to it.|Fresh
The Old Man & The Gun has to go down as a success, and 'a must' for anyone with a serious interest in Redford's long and remarkable career. If this is the Sundance Kid's swansong, it's certainly a good one.|Fresh
Hollywood rarely does curtain calls this elegant.|Fresh
For those who have lived through the many ages of Redford...it is hard to think this will be his last acting hurrah. Great to see him going out, once more, with all guns blazing.|Fresh
Forrest remains a delightful mystery as he floats lightly through life - and that's absolutely fine.|Fresh
The truth is, you can afford to miss Lowery's portrait of the (con) artist as an old man. Paradoxically, if you see it, you won't feel your time has been wasted.|Fresh
[An] elegantly written, fact-based picture...|Fresh
Rarely has a film about stealing been so nice. In its own unassuming way, it's an affecting and strangely comforting experience.|Fresh
Stylish, witty and beautifully shot, though very much from the viewpoint of charming robber Forrest; a thief with a gun is still a thief with a gun. Spacek and Redford delight; I never believed in the relationship between Forrest and the cop on his tail.|Fresh
It's got a real old cinema feel to it... it feels like a movie that was made in a different age.|Fresh
Some may call THE OLD MAN & THE GUN a slight piece of filmmaking, but I call it wondrous.|Fresh
The casting is so good it's almost rude...|Fresh
If this really is curtains, it's a great way to take a bow.|Fresh
Flat-out charming, a movie stripped of the usual clichés about ageing (it's a world away from the recent Michael Caine dud King of Thieves) and shot with the retro feel of a New Hollywood classic.|Fresh
A wonderful piece in cinema, heart warming and lovable.|Fresh
On the basis of this movie alone, there is life, and talent, in the old man yet.|Fresh
The Old Man & The Gun offers a fond farewell to Redford that captivates thanks to another virtuoso performance from its charismatic veteran.|Fresh
David Lowery's film has the grace to treat its elder characters with respect. It does that by treating them like human beings.|Fresh
[Redford's] scenes with Spacek in particular are beautifully played and have just enough bite and irony to avoid slipping into mushy nostalgia.|Fresh
Redford is wonderful in this will-o'-the-wisp role: his easy way with comedy is to the fore, his physical grace apparently undimmed by age.|Fresh
Well, The Old Man & the Gun isn't a bad note for Redford to end on - certainly better than last year's unfortunately titled Our Souls at Night.|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun is a character piece that off-sets scenes of poignant introspection with thrilling action scenes, shooting Tucker's robberies with old-school zooms and whip-pans.|Fresh
Neither too clever for its own good nor simply a nostalgia-trip pastiche aimed only at chin-strumming cinephiles, it is, in a word, fun.|Fresh
It's the kind of movie so smoothly made that we barely realise the skill that has gone into its production and performances.|Fresh
Essentially a love letter to Redford's own screen career, it helps if you share his twinkle-eyed nostalgia for roguish criminals.|Fresh
If this really is the end, Robert Redford has truly gone out with a bang.|Fresh
It takes dedication, good hair days and a serene world-view to be a good bank robber. That means Robert Redford and it means The Old Man and the Gun.|Fresh
It's a shame Redford might be retiring, but what a fitting note to go out on.|Fresh
A delightful folk story from one of the best filmmakers working today - and a fitting final turn from Redford, all easy charm and grace. It takes a lifetime of effort to look this effortless.|Fresh
A deft, nostalgic, sentimental and surprisingly life affirming caper which is every bit as smart and accomplished as its star.|Fresh
David Lowery continues to impress with this charming love letter to old school crime films and lovely sendoff for legend Robert Redford. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is too understated to quite click as some kind of masterpiece and yet proves so damn enjoyable that it almost is anyway. Yes, they don't make them like this anymore.|Fresh
Lowry provides a character and setting that practically demands a quiet, quintessential Redford-ian performance and the great actor obliges, with the tip of his cap, a wink, and a smile.|Fresh
Director David Lowery's chief focus is to keep the character of Forrest Tucker within the popular perception of Redford's persona. And it works, both as a light crimedy and as a valentine to Redford.|Fresh
There was an old man with a gun Who spent his whole life on the run|Fresh
He schmoozes the bank tellers in the movie and 82-year-old Robert Redford does the same on the audience.|Fresh
Exists basically to give Redford and Spacek a chance to... take a few bows, and remind us all of how enormously pleasant it is to watch old pros pass easy challenges.|Fresh
The film is entertaining and engaging, with plenty of character to be involved with, not to mention gentlemanly 'old world' bank robbing.|Fresh
Uplifting, amusing and profoundly moving on multiple levels, this is a film for the discerning... the perfect role for Robert Redford.|Fresh
There's nothing here that's going to vex or perplex you, and you'll walk out of the cinema happy and satisfied. A real crowd-pleaser.|Fresh
Robert Redford, who plays the old crook, has said this will be his last screen role and, if that proves to be the case, The Old Man & The Gun is not a bad way to end a distinguished career.|Fresh
The movie is at its best in the exchanges between Redford and Sissy Spacek as Jewel.|Fresh
Redford has said that he wanted to go out on a fun note, and that is an accurate description of this movie.|Rotten
Filled with thematic callbacks and visual references to Redford's incredible career, most notably to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the film, like the man, is classy, intelligent, witty, handsome and delightfully old-fashioned.|Fresh
Matching Redford for charm is Sissy Spacek as his love interest, the horse ranch-owning widow he 'helps' by the side of the road while trying to elude the cops on his tail.|Fresh
Director David Lowery dramatises the story with nostalgia, romanticism and care.|Fresh
For the old man, he can't help but catch one more wave.|Fresh
Thank goodness, then, that, if this is indeed to be his last hurrah, The Old Man and the Gun is a near-perfect send-off.|Fresh
Not much happens, but its leisurely, unusually congenial temperament strikes me as a small miracle.|Fresh
Robert Redford shouldn't make this his last performance. He's having too much fun .. and so is the audience.|Fresh
An entertaining crime caper, with Redford showing us exactly why he's one of the most charming actors ever to grace the screen.|Fresh
An entertaining caper from start to finish that further solidifies David Lowery as one of the best up-and-coming directors in the industry.|Fresh
The Old Man and The Gun is a folktale rather than a biopic, blurring the lines between Tucker and Redford to the point where it doesn't really matter which is speaking.|Fresh
Lowery capitalizes on the audience's history with Redford to build a low-key character study that contains the vibes of a folktale.|Fresh
...a fantastic swan song for a great actor...|Fresh
Brimming with rascally good cheer, Redford churns out another feel-good flick mostly for the old folks.|Fresh
There's a timeless charm to The Old Man and the Gun, easily obsessed in the breezy chemistry of its two elegant stars.|Fresh
With actors like Redford, Sissy Spacek and Tom Waits (Tom Waits, actor!), banality is not on the bill of fare. (A side of corn, sure.)|Fresh
Let's leave it at this: Redford's film farewell reminds us of what made his career so memorable, but it definitely won't be among the many movies for which he's long remembered.|Fresh
Its attitude toward American individualism is unconnected to recognizable experience.|Rotten
The Old Man & the Gun is ... more sweet than savoury. That does not take away from its simple pleasures, and the warmth it provides on a sunless day. Treat it like secret medicine, and its gifts will unfurl like a warm role of greenbacks.|Fresh
This is a fairly light movie, with plenty of humor, a little romance, and a little drama. Redford, Spacek and Affleck all give strong performances in this breezy little heist movie.|Fresh
While there's not much to the plot, I'm not sure you can exit the theater without a smile.|Fresh
The character-driven film shines the most when Redford and Spacek share the screen. It's a fascinating story that would be hard to swallow if it wasn't true.|Fresh
A love letter to the 1970s/early '80s, the aging outlaw trope so often seen in Westerns, and to film itself, with David Lowery's love and homage for previous filmmakers shining through. But, above all, it's a tribute to Robert Redford.|Fresh
As amusing as it can be, there is something to be said for the relative insignificance of The Old Man & the Gun. While the film is light on its feet and slickly entertaining, is that enough?|Rotten
"Rather than the action sequences one might expect in a heist movie, ""The Old Man and the Gun"" revels in the little moments."|Fresh
Robert Redford is an American legend, full stop, and he uses all of his tricks in The Old Man & the Gun to win you over and to sweep you up and to break your heart.|Fresh
The first two acts of the film are light and cheerful, echoing the buoyant mood of its protagonist, who never seems happier than in the middle of a caper.|Fresh
Look how tickled the supporting players are in their scenes with the Old Man.|Fresh
Redford's swan-song performance is far more interesting and soulful than the splashy headline version of the bank robber sold to the public in the 1980s.|Fresh
If this is truly Robert Redford's final performance, he's going out with an exclamation point.|Fresh
There's something singular about how perfect Redford and Tucker are suited for each other, as both artists live the true stories that hustlers have been trying to replicate ever since, each new copy just seeming paler in comparison.|Fresh
A cops and robbers tale, a romance, and a gentle comedy, too. The good news is, I'm pretty sure once Redford sees how delightful the film is, he'll give up all this nonsense about quitting acting.|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun kicks off with an almost unreasonably charming sequence...|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun is not a swan song; it's a duckwalk -- without the guitar.|Rotten
A so-so movie but a great last performance from one of the best ever.|Fresh
It's pleasant enough, but, well, you do the best you can with the material you've got, you go out with dignity, and then -- with your last ounce of strength -- you refuse to listen to the sappy exit song.|Fresh
Whether Redford sticks to his decision to retire from acting or not, The Old Man & the Gun is another fine adventure for the Hollywood golden boy.|Fresh
A gentle caper comedy full of wistful, wrinkly smiles and a sweetly elegiac tone.|Fresh
Redford... is eminently enjoyable, infusing his character with relatability and humor.|Fresh
While Redford may look coarse and hardened, the man's still got a twinkle in the eye and an effervescent charisma that will have you swooning before you know it.|Fresh
David Lowery's film is a fitting, if lukewarm, curtain call -- a character study which finds sly ways to summate a career spent playing charming cads.|Fresh
"The Old Man & the Gun is one of the year's best movies, and at 93 minutes it is one of the best recent examples I can think of regarding that Roger Ebert adage: ""No good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough."""|Fresh
A worthy swan song for Redford.|Fresh
The more we know about Forrest, the less we like him, and ... it makes for an unevenness of tone in the final act. Still, Redford is always worth watching.|Fresh
Redford has since said he's not closing the door on acting after all, which makes him a lot like Forrest Tucker, the elderly bank robber he portrays. Both are having too much fun, and are too good at what they do to stop now.|Fresh
This is as fine and affectionate a send-off as any movie icon could wish.|Fresh
One final opportunity to gaze on the greatness that is the charm of Robert Redford. With a wink and a smile, it's a fond farewell indeed.|Fresh
Redford and Spacek are wonderful together which is a good thing because this old-coot Jean Valjean lacks a proper Javert.|Fresh
The Old Man and the Gun won't stand-out among other films this year, but it will be remembered fondly, much like its star and subject.|Fresh
The film is sluggish and melancholy, yet Redford, a master at his craft, steals the show...|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun is a pleasantly breezy cops and (aging) robbers tale anchored by Redford's charismatic performance - be it his last one or not.|Fresh
If this happens to be Robert Redford's cheery ride into the sunset, he does so with style.|Fresh
Robert Redford gets a role he could sleep through (and maybe occasionally does) as the title character continually on the lookout for one more score.|Fresh
Watching Redford have this much fun is, as always, a goddamn delight.|Fresh
It's the feel-good film of the year exactly when we need one.|Fresh
Despite some nice scenes between Spacek and Redford, The Old Man & the Gun feels like a slightly creaky version of a movie we've seen before.|Rotten
Redford understands that his movie star charisma has not dimmed in the many years he's been a star and uses it to full advantage. His character is a man everyone is charmed by in various capacities, and Redford certainly gives us plenty of reasons why.|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun meanders along at a sluggish pace, at times poorly lit and at other times throwing out dialogue that's hard to decipher. It lacks the sense of urgency and purpose you would expect from a crime-caper movie.|Rotten
"With a grainy look and a deliberately simple tone, ""The Old Man & the Gun"" looks like it could have been released in the early 1970s, right down to the old-fashioned titles. As send-offs go, we couldn't have asked for better."|Fresh
A triumph of texture, a tender, deeply felt slice of Americana with the magnetic draw of a adroitly structured short story.|Fresh
Redford fans will delight in this flick. Everything that made him a star is out in full force here.|Fresh
"If Redford and Spacek bring sparks to ""The Old Man & the Gun,"" the supporting cast makes its engine hum."|Fresh
The whole movie has a loose-limbed, shambling, unpretentious charm, not unlike the matter-of-fact bemusement of Grann's original New Yorker piece.|Fresh
If this is Redford's last movie role... he's leaving at the height of his powers.|Fresh
Redford is clearly enjoying a chance to play a mature rascal. And he does so beautifully in this modest but magnetic offering.|Fresh
In filmmaker David Lowery's hands, The Old Man & the Gun becomes more than just a biopic about an aging outlaw. It's a tribute to Robert Redford and the lasting effect he has left behind on the film industry.|Fresh
It won't stand among Robert Redford's most memorable films - of which there are too many to name - but this movie left this critic smiling wide.|Fresh
Lyrically and lovingly shot on 16 mm, it's an endearing tale -- part crime thriller, part light comedy, part love story -- that makes full use of Redford's significant charm.|Fresh
A pleasurably breezy crime story and character study.|Fresh
The movie is an old-fashioned star vehicle, catered to Redford's laid-back approach. As Tucker, Redford uses his personality to charm not only Spacek's widowed Jewel, a few bank managers and tellers - but us as well.|Fresh
The Old Man and the Gun is easily Lowery's breeziest and most enjoyable film to date. But underneath its charming façade lies the ache of finality, and the realization that every grand ride comes to an end.|Fresh
To watch these two pros flirt with each other... it's almost like they're flirting with you, that's how good they are.|Fresh
It's just too sweet for me... it actually makes me mad.|Rotten
When you pair Redford with the equally delightful and talented Spacek, you have a match made in heaven.|Fresh
It's a sweet seduction and another example of Lowery's' radical approach to filmmaking. No wonder Redford wanted to work with him.|Fresh
One couldn't ask for a lovelier final film than 'The Old Man & the Gun.' And though it may sound like hyperbole, after such an esteemed career, it's one of [Redford's] very best.|Fresh
Redford is an old charmer. He and Spacek are wonderful. Film, not so much.|Fresh
The movie, in its way, pays homage to Redford's career, and all the times he's played a charming rebel or an outlaw. Perhaps it's because he's making so few movies these days, it's easier to appreciate just how good he is.|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun is a delight to watch... In a way, it is almost as much of a throwback to a different and more ambitious era of moviemaking as Redford himself.|Fresh
It's impossible to justify their misdeeds, but so charmed you're okay giving your morality a two-hour vacation.|Fresh
The trouble is that writer/director David Lowery drains the story of any tension, suspense, or conflict.|Rotten
I can't think of a more appropriate subject.|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun is Redford's show. He knows it. Lowery knows. They make the best of it.|Fresh
Redford thoroughly enjoys himself in a role that's perfect for his age (82) and personality.|Fresh
It's old school matinee fare delivered with a tipped cap and a warm smile.|Fresh
A modest but engaging tale of larceny and late-life love, based on a true story...If it does prove Redford's final film as an actor, it provides him with an ingratiating exit from the stage.|Fresh
It's Out Of Sight without the edge or the passion.|Rotten
Forrest Tucker's swan song moments in The Old Man & the Gun are well tailored for Robert Redford's swan song as an actor. It's a damn good performance that also serves as a fitting curtain call.|Fresh
The beauty of Redford's rock-steady performances over the last six decades or so is that he never showed off, and yet always commanded your attention. That's no small feat.|Fresh
It's hard to imagine anyone in this role but Redford. Without him, there would be little here worth seeing.|Fresh
[Redford] delivers a glorious, sly performance in a gloriously sly movie that masks its idiosyncrasy in brisk and breezy storytelling.|Fresh
"""Old Man"" is a wonderfully understated star vehicle."|Fresh
"Redford's inherent charms do so much of the work in ""The Old Man and the Gun"" that they obscure what a questionable character Tucker really is."|Fresh
"Mostly we just exist in the moment with Tucker, and that's fine, because we're existing with Redford, too. ""The Old Man & the Gun"" is his film, ultimately, and that's fine."|Fresh
[Robert Redford's] performance in The Old Man & The Gun is truly an homage to the Oscar winner's acting career.|Fresh
It's a perfect role for [Redford's] swan song.|Fresh
This is a Robin Hood and his Merry Men kind of tale that just makes me feel good.|Fresh
For an actor of Redford's caliber to retire by playing an outlaw is fitting, because being an artist is almost the same fate. No matter where life takes you, that fire in the gut remains.|Fresh
The movie may not be a big deal, but it's a shrewd small one...|Fresh
You buy into the geniality of Lowery's movie, nourished as it is by the entire cast.|Fresh
Robert Redford goes out in a blaze of story.|Fresh
Redford gets one more chance to showcase his debonair charm in this low-key crime drama, while effortlessly generating sympathy for a rather unscrupulous rogue.|Fresh
Robert Redford goes out in a blaze of glory in what he says will be his final acting job in a film.|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun is ostensibly Redford's final on-screen role; in August, he announced his retirement from acting. If he makes good on that pledge, he's capping off his sterling filmography with a dazzling crowd pleaser...|Fresh
Robert Redford tips his hat to the outlaws that have helped make him an enduring star as well as his inherent affability that makes him such an endearing one.|Fresh
Light on its feet, very laid back, and underlined by retro 1981 style, The Old Man & the Gun uses the biography of a famous bank robber as a casual nod farewell to a great movie star.|Fresh
"It's hard to believe that this snorer is what Robert Redford wants as his Swan Song. Most of director Lowery's credits consist of ""shorts."" Here he took what should have been a short and dragged it out for 90 minutes, which seemed a lot longer."|Rotten
The Old Man and the Gun is as old-fashioned and sincere, as temperamentally un-postmodern, as it's possible for a movie to be.|Fresh
I think the film disserves what Redford, at his best, can be as an actor in favor of a fraudulent, senior citizen variation on glossy movie-star iconography.|Rotten
"Not since 1982's ""The Grey Fox,"" in which the late Richard Farnsworth portrayed stagecoach robber Bill Miner, has a true story about a gangster been so wistful, so enchanting, so seductive in championing the criminal."|Fresh
That Lowery leaves so much to the imagination-that he adores Tucker and enjoys being around him but refuses to explain him-is perhaps the movie's greatest virtue.|Fresh
It's a story about how the years go by, and who we are. It's a story about all of us.|Fresh
The Old Man & the Gun is a vehicle in the best sense of that term, a good story that showcases its leading man to best advantage.|Fresh
You're not likely to see any other film this year with characters having such great chemistry as Redford and Spacek.|Fresh
Avoids the forced tension of many heist movies.|Fresh
A puckish film with a wistful quality, a gently comic end-of-the-line adventure about doing what you love, the passage of time and the things that might have been.|Fresh
As swan songs go, it's got a nice beat, and it's easy to dance to.|Fresh
Still, it's a modest treat for movie lovers with memories that extend beyond last summer's comic-book extravaganzas, and not only because of Mr. Redford's presence.|Fresh
A deliberate echo of Redford's early iconic work, Old Man acts as a bookend to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the George Roy Hill film that turned Redford into a movie star in 1969.|Fresh
Warm and funny and mesmerizing in its understated perfection, The Old Man & the Gun is a splendid experience.|Fresh
It's mellow, like a campfire tale, or your grandpa's stories set to whiskey.|Fresh
I come to praise Redford, not to bury him. I want to celebrate the groundbreaking performer forgotten in the wake of the ultra-handsome superstar.|Rotten
"The Old Man"" is notable -- ... for the audacity of building a movie around a septuagenarian criminal at all."|Fresh
Robert Redford robs banks and steals your heart. And whether David Lowery's exuberant gift of a film reps his final bow or not, Redford gives a virtuoso performance that feels like a valedictory. You want to salute him.|Fresh
A gentle comedy-drama with wry humor and a sunset-colored wistful streak.|Fresh
This is a performance to savor; this is the Sundance Kid in a different era with a softer, but still definitive fall.|Fresh
At a time when bluster, bragging and histrionic displays of self-pity are apparently the defining characteristics of American manhood, it's nice to be reminded of the virtues of discretion and quiet.|Fresh
Lowery's film is an easy-breezy celebration of Redford's charisma and a fitting swan song given that it might be his final on-camera role.|Fresh
"If this is truly it in a cinema life well-lived, ""Old Man"" couldn't be a more perfect adieu..."|Fresh
An undemanding vehicle for Robert Redford.|Rotten
Chemistry counts for something, and Robert Redford and Sissy Spacek have it in spades in the trifling-at-best, galling-at-worst dramedy The Old Man & the Gun.|Rotten
Of course, none of this works without Redford, putting in superlative work in a role that, without cliché, it feels like he was born to play.|Fresh
It's a gentle inversion of the glamorous thief trope, so gentle that if you're not paying attention, you might miss it.|Fresh
It's a story you wouldn't believe to be true unless you see it, and after watching [Redford's] adaptation, it's easy to understand how and why Tucker was so efficacious at being successful as a career criminal.|Fresh
The film is motivated by Redford's charm and he carries it thoroughly with grace. It's as if he was hanging out with Paddington Bear and his pleasantness rubbed off on him.|Fresh
The great pleasure of the film is its metatextual layers, as the legends of Forrest's exploits seem to meld with those of Redford himself.|Fresh
The Old Man and the Gun is a solid bit of mythmaking, but Spacek is its richest joy.|Fresh
Goes down easy and once you're done your ready for round two.|Fresh
It's a gentle, funny crowd-pleaser with a melancholy streak.|Fresh
The most impressive feat Lowery manages with Old Man is just how little of it feels like embarrassingly overt pastiche.|Fresh
If Redford really is done, this is a perfect way for him to say goodbye.|Fresh
It would require a true curmudgeon to not derive pleasure from that twinkling performance from Redford, radiating smoothness, wisdom and charm to the very end.|Fresh
Redford could've done a whole lot worse than exiting with The Old Man, but it's unlikely he could've done much better.|Fresh
If you feared [it] would be just another farce where old people engage in shenanigans unbecoming of their age, rest easy...It distills a movie veteran's record into one last story.|Fresh
A love letter to a cinematic legend, serving as a perfect final film for someone who long ago surpassed mere actor status to become an icon.|Fresh
