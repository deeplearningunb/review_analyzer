Olli Mäki has its own sublime view of the world where love is not easily attained nor abandoned.|Fresh
Breathtakingly original, as it feels like we are time-travelling to watch the events unfold... Performances are offhanded and almost startlingly natural.|Fresh
This film is an exquisite breath of fresh air... [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Viewers who come under the apprehension that this is any kind of sports film are bound to be thrown by the wryly funny, mild-mannered yet deeply felt movie they find here.|Fresh
It's no Raging Bull. It doesn't want to be. If director Martin Scorsese was aiming for grand opera in his 1980 classic, Happiest Day is more like a breezy jazz riff.|Fresh
The film is a fresh-out-of-the-gate triumph for young writer-director Juho Kuosmanen, starting with his casting of Jarkko Lahti.|Fresh
It's an unusual boxing movie, and it comes without the many clichs of the genre.|Fresh
We don't see too many biopics in this country about guys who think winning isn't everything, the only thing, or even that much of a thing.|Fresh
For Kuosmanen, The Happiest Day... is really a love story, and the low-key attitude is what makes it such a winning film.|Fresh
Performances are effective throughout. Lahti, in the title role, is completely believable as both a talented athlete and a humble soul.|Fresh

Performances are effective throughout. Lahti, in the title role, is completely believable as both a talented athlete and a humble soul.|Fresh
The major reason the film works is because [screenwriters Mikko] Myllylahti and [director Juho] Kuosmanen don't see this as a love story or even a story about boxing...|Fresh
The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mki is a portrait of a man who is ultimately a nurturer rather than a destroyer - in spite of punching people for a living - and it's one of the best films of the year.|Fresh
Imparts an understated beauty to otherwise predictable truisms.|Fresh
This acute insight into sporting sacrifice, the price of celebrity, the appeal of the underdog and the hierarchical nature of Finnish society... an unforced nouvelle vague feel that places it in the front rank of boxing pictures.|Fresh
A poignant movie with a much calmer idea of happiness than the average sports movie.|Fresh
A warm, welcome sideways look at the Finnish featherweight boxing champion Olli Mki.|Fresh
Mki is played by the small, sinewy, mildly puzzled Jarkko Lahti; the wonderfully warm Oona Airola plays his fiance, Raija. The black-and-white film pays careful attention to period detail and character, and less to the blood, sweat and tears.|Fresh
There's neither the overheated lyricism of Raging Bull nor the pulp grittiness of a noir like The Set-Up; everything in Kuosmanen's film feels earthy and grounded.|Fresh
A sweet, low-key production with a modest charm.|Fresh
"""The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki"" deepens quietly. This is Mr. Kuosmanen's first feature (he has directed a few shorts), and if he had any rookie jitters you wouldn't know it."|Fresh
A gentle, shrewd, somehow mysterious love story, based on real life, beautifully photographed in luminous black-and-white and drawing inspiration from Scorsese and Truffaut.|Fresh
...Olli Mki bucks the cinematic convention of sporting self-sacrifice with one bracingly simple suggestion: that finding, being with and caring for the person you love might be more important than running yourself ragged in pursuit of passing glory.|Fresh
Juho Kuosmanen's delightful debut is as far from Raging Bull as a B&W fight movie can get, with Mki (Jarkko Lahti) keener on local lass Raija (Oona Airola) than training.|Fresh
It has the same low key naturalism and idiosyncratic humour found in classic new wave movies like A Blonde In Love and Closely Observed Trains.|Fresh
A heightened take on reality, revelling in the idiosyncrasies and absurdities of every day life, and yet while doing so never detracts from the realism of the piece, as we become so caught up in this fledging relationship.|Fresh
Olli Mki isn't a knockout, but it does go the distance.|Fresh
This classically-styled romance serves as an intoxicating reminder that historic sporting events invariably have a human side to them.|Fresh
This is an exceptionally modest, low-key affair but with an undoubted charm and a welcome humour running through the heartache.|Fresh
An unexpectedly lyrical drama about life's innocent pleasures.|Fresh
This is a sports tale in which the character building has almost nothing to do with the sport.|Fresh
As for the winner and new champion, it has to be Kuosmanen, who never met a boxing-film clich he couldn't discreetly avoid.|Fresh
The performances are unaffected and wonderful and there's much gentle humour to be drawn from Olli's struggles to make nice with sponsors, lose weight and participate in a clumsy documentary.|Fresh
Based on a true story, Juho Kuosmanen's tender, understated love story is more Lost in Translation than Rocky|Fresh
Juho Kuosmanen's film feeds on glances and smiles, from complicity between chaos and the patriotic pressure of every country. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A brilliant and touching film that defends itself against all the topics, common places and mythologies of boxing cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A worthwhile showcase for excellent performances, assured direction, and a twist on the sports story that prioritizes character before history.|Fresh
Boxing movies aren't always remembered for their romance, but that's the defining element here...|Fresh
Through Jarkko Lahti's skillfully internalized, soft-spoken performance, we see a mirror to our imperfect selves.|Fresh
A unique and beautiful boxing movie shot on 16mm in black and white, it's like Wild Strawberries meets Raging Bull -- though the bull isn't so much raging as in love.|Fresh
Kuosmanen's impeccable, buoyant first feature upends all the conventions of the fight film genre.|Fresh
So gracefully does The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki sidestep the formulaic mold of struggle, perseverance and simple victory or defeat that it could almost be considered an anti-fight picture.|Fresh
A lyrical sense of bittersweet acceptance permeates freshman director Juho Kuosmanen's marvelous sports biopic from its very first, perfectly composed frame.|Fresh
Juho Kuosmanen's debut feature The Happiest Day In The Life Of Olli Mki has a gently humanistic and upbeat sweep.|Fresh
Even if it plays in a minor key throughout its runtime, it is all it needs to be.|Fresh
Low-key performances by the conflicted Lahti and the radiant Airola prove the final knockout hit.|Fresh
