Every chase, every fistfight, every daring stunt; all of them shot and directed to as near to perfection you can get.|Fresh
There is not a screen large enough to contain the eye-popping, heart-stopping spectacle and thrill that is Mission: Impossible - Fallout. This summer's - year's - must see marvel.|Fresh
[Mission: Impossible - Fallout] once again relies on coherent, well-executed action set pieces, a few moments of winking dialogue and Cruise's complete willingness to hurl himself headlong into harm's way if it might allow him to win our love.|Fresh
Christopher McQuarrie has brought together a great cast and crew to bring his screenplay to life.|Fresh
A thrilling, surprisingly coherent film that feels two decades in the making.|Fresh
... this blockbuster satisfies in its purpose but doesn't earn the title 'impossible to miss'.|Fresh
Such will be Cruise's monument, and to quote Watership Down, perhaps it would not have displeased him.|Fresh
A breathless blast of honest-to-goodness action and a visceral treat for thrill seekers.|Fresh
No movie [this year] delivered spectacle better or more consistently for its running time.|Fresh
Tom Cruise has never flirted with death so closely before. This film makes all his prior stunts look like cakewalks.|Fresh
The quibbles are minor when compared to the energy and exuberance flowing through the majority of the picture.|Fresh
Rates an A+ when it comes to rousing action sequences.|Fresh
Cruise is a live-action testament to his own ability to take punishment, a kind of human sacrifice.|Fresh
With the series being this good this far into itself, long live Ethan Hunt!|Fresh
Christopher McQuarrie's direction feels especially assured this time around.|Fresh
Featuring tremendous action sequences, smart dialogue and emotional depth, this installment is one of the best action movies of the year.|Fresh
Facing off villains, middle age and broken bones, The Man From A.N.K.L.E is better than ever. Joyously exciting, with an amiably self-mocking Cruise throwing himself into death-defying stunts, and action scenes that go on longer than you think possible.|Fresh
Fallout fits the template of exactly what you would want in a Mission:Impossible film, and no one can deny Cruise's commitment to the role, however dangerous it might be.|Fresh
Cruise not only does some incredible stunts, he actually lets you know a little bit more about who Ethan Hunt is.|Fresh
Each successive Mission: Impossible movie takes us further away from understanding the politics and morality of espionage.|Rotten
More than 20 years after its first iteration, both the Mission:Impossible franchise and its hero, Ethan Hunt, have reinvented themselves numerous times and have become the best action movie combo the industry has to offer.|Fresh
Ethan Hunt has finally begun to escape being defined solely by the aura of the star that plays him.|Fresh
The final guard of a dying age of superstar, Tom Cruise is the last action hero and never has his skill been in sharper focus.|Fresh
The thing that truly sets Mission: Impossible - Fallout apart from your average action film is its unwavering commitment to relentless, dynamic fun. Cruise and McQuarrie rev the engines from moment one and take off on the cinematic Autobahn.|Fresh
An absolutely triumphant feast of an action movie. Narratively strong, the ensemble are electric and the direction is historic levels of excellence. Bravo, team.|Fresh
The red herrings are all better than the real answers, and that's a problem.|Fresh
The laws of movie gravity aren't supposed to work like this, but here we are. Twenty-two years in, six movies deep, and we have not only a franchise best, but a high-water mark for the entire genre.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible has been angling to take the mantle of best action franchise and with the all-out insanity of Fallout, it takes that mantle, obliterating all of its competition along the way.|Fresh
It's big, exhilarating, breathtaking and simply just bloody good - accept the mission.|Fresh
"""The reason you need to see a movie in the theater. This is one damn fine action flick."""|Fresh
Sure, it was an enjoyable time at the movies. But I bet if you ask me about it next week, I'll barely be able to remember watching it.|Fresh
A non-stop thrill ride that entertains like nothing else has this year.|Fresh
We might feel like the Road Runner trying to keep up with the proceedings ... but [director/writer Christopher] McQuarrie always has us oriented and, amazingly, whiplash-free.|Fresh
Without question the best blockbuster of the year. Mission accomplished!|Fresh
Tom Cruise's sheer bliss at portraying Ethan Hunt elevates Fallout to the top of the M:I films.|Fresh
Overall, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is one of the best entries in the franchise. It is both emotionally and visually exciting to experience.|Fresh
"""Mission: Impossible"" is the closest thing Hollywood has going next to a James Bond franchise, and going it is."|Fresh
I stayed to the final credit, in case there was a clever tag, but I didn't feel cheated when there wasn't one. I needed the time to catch my breath.|Fresh
This movie is so bomb. It has to be one of the best action films I've seen in a really long time. This had me jumping in my seat... Run, don't walk, to the theater.|Fresh
I think there's an interesting connection between Cruise and the character he plays...there's a detachment, a sadness around him, what he's had to sacrifice to carry the world's burden on his shoulders.|Fresh
Here is a film of spectacle and personality, thrills and feeling, great technical skill and fine storytelling. It just also may be film of the year.|Fresh
...one of the new century's very best action films.|Fresh
Go see this on the biggest screen possible...if you don't have fun with this, your wires are crossed.|Fresh
It really does combine the best elements of the Fast & The Furious and James Bond movies.|Fresh
If you're gonna make ten of these, let this be a lesson right here. Follow this one. It's almost perfect.|Fresh
So much of what you've seen of Ethan Hunt--the way that he's developed in the last 20 plus years since the first Mission Impossible--is visible in this performance from Tom Cruise.|Fresh
[The film] doesn't transcend being part of its formula summer action franchise genre, but it's certainly one of the better current examples of the breed.|Fresh
The stakes throughout the entire movie were incredibly high.|Fresh
It is one of the best action movies.|Fresh
... the best action film of this year so far - one that carries a lot of twists and turns in its convoluted narrative without amounting to much.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a delirious fantasy which delivers a super-sized kick.|Fresh
Much of our enjoyment of the Mission: Impossible series is derived from the fact that filmmakers continue to challenge Cruise's ageing body and our ageing minds - and by extension, the traditional core of action filmmaking.|Fresh
The result is a pulse-pounding affair that's easily the franchise's tightest. You don't often say that about a two-and-a-half hour runtime, but it's true.|Fresh
It is a great continuation to Rogue Nation. While it's not as good as Rogue Nation, I will say that it is definitely Worth Watching.|Fresh
It's fantastic.|Fresh
Mission Impossible is the greatest film franchise in cinematic history|Fresh
All of it was worth it for the last 30 minutes...so ludicrous, and it made me laugh with joy and delight.|Fresh
Tom Cruise is the American Jackie Chan at this point. He's doing his own stunts for the love of the game.|Fresh
Fallout, while a film with phenomenal, unthinkable action, is by no means the best action movie ever made.|Fresh
Now this is a summer action movie.|Fresh
Relentlessly actioned-packed with stylistic set pieces and a surprisingly dimensional story that adds to the intensity, this is a fun summer flick you don't wanna miss.|Fresh
"F. Scott Fitzgerald said ""action is character"" -- which, if true, means the Ethan Hunt we see in Fallout is the most complex movie character of all time."|Fresh
See it on the biggest screen possible.|Fresh
A solid entry into the Mission Impossible franchise, with Cruise once again proving that he's still as charismatic as ever in front of the camera. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to buckle in for one hell of an action-packed ride.|Fresh
The Tom Cruisiest action film ever made manages to lift a franchise that, at this point, seems unstoppable.|Fresh
While the story is simply ludicrous, the sensational camera work and action more than make up for it.|Fresh
McQuarrie stuffs a great 120-minute action film inside a very good 147-minute one that might have benefited from another run through the editing program.|Fresh
Even the plot is lackluster. Couldn't writer/director Christopher McQuarrie have come up with something a little more original than the tired old stolen plutonium schtick?|Rotten
Filled with the kind of visual and technical mastery that most features are lucky to display in one scene, let alone in set-piece after set-piece after set-piece, all while conjuring an authentic, edge-of-your seat emotional reaction.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible keeps its high quality consistent into the sixth entry of this summer staple.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible - Fallout is packed with amazing action sequences and an effectively twisty-turny plot, taking the franchise to new heights.|Fresh
Every time the action seems almost comically exotic and death-defying, McQuarrie ups the ante, often filming over Cruise's shoulder so we experience every thrill up close.|Fresh
Tom Cruise fantasy camp.|Rotten
Christopher McQuarrie manages to not only keep things fresh story wise and the audience engaged but the stunts - one of Mission Impossible's greatest trademarks - still leave us with our mouths open in surprise and excitement.|Fresh
'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' is an excellent action blockbuster... and the ultimate proof that McQuarrie, Abrams (still on as producer) and Cruise know how to handle the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Bravo to the technical and location directors and the fine editing. MI: Freefall is sheer fun and, while it's much longer than usual at two-and-a-half hours, it's worth every tense moment.|Fresh
"This one will be remembered as ""the one with the helicopter chase"". Which is an insanely awesome sequence, by the way."|Fresh
"Not only the best of the ""Mission: Impossible"" films, ""FALLOUT"" is also one of the best films of the year"|Fresh
It's imperfect and over-the-top, but it's undeniably fun. This sort of blockbuster is why people go to the movies in the first place.|Fresh
We have to start with those incredible action sequences. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I long ago gave up letting action sequences make me tense, so why was I clutching my armrest? McQuarrie's massive tornadoes of bodies, steel and space are visceral, energetic [and] exhilarating.|Fresh
Dollar for dollar, pound for pound, this is the best entertainment of the summer.|Fresh
Fallout gets it. From a one-on-one fight in a bathroom to a helicopter chase, the film never loses our attention and manages to surprise us every time. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Fallout's one huge strength is that the action is consistently riveting|Fresh
Mission movies provide endless amounts of foolish fun... Put that together with Energizer-Bunny Tom Cruise, who enjoys doing insane stunts to keep life interesting, and you've got quite a satisfying summer blockbuster.|Fresh
In a figurative sense... Ethan Hunt manifests the role of the last great romantic hero, in a literal sense Mission Impossible reaffirms the name of Tom Cruise as the last great star of American commercial cinema. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It pays not to think too much about the plot, and the film actively distracts you from doing so. But it all looks fantastic, is great fun and two and a half hours roars by.|Fresh
a great, unapologetic nose-dive into old-school, free-fall, red-meat action that plays as a stark reminder of why physical presence and real stunts still have the cinematic upper hand over CGI and green screens|Fresh
It's 'Impossible' not to enjoy it.|Fresh
Cruise is insane.|Fresh
The series [and Cruise in it] is just getting better and better.|Fresh
Intense, fun, and I highly recommend it. You're good right here, Tom Cruise.|Fresh
What McQuarrie and Cruise do well, with minimal dialogue needed, is make it clear that IMF agent Ethan Hunt has become more vulnerable.|Fresh
Hollywood cinema does not have a lighter, more sympathetic or better-made series. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Even as Fallout marches to a surprisingly generic ticking-clock-and-explosive climax, the action is energised by Cruise's wild zeal.|Fresh
Plot is irrelevant here, and made overly complicated, but what carries it is great fight choreography, chases and pacing and a ridiculous sense of fun.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a ferocious heart-pounding cardio workout in your cinema sweat.|Fresh
Outside of his ambitious sci-fi movies, Cruise knows his Mission: Impossible. 22 years and six films in, he has perfected the art of convoluted international intrigue mixed with over-the-top stunts that he performs himself.|Fresh
A rare example of a franchise improving with each new instalment; Fallout is a benchmark setter that begs to be seen on the big screen.|Fresh
An elite thriller with amazing action scenes, solid performances and even a dab of humanity.|Fresh
With the Resident Evil saga apparently complete and no further Mad Max adventures on the immediate horizon, Mission: Impossible must qualify as the best Hollywood action series now going.|Fresh
This movie certainly delivers plenty of action, and masked men, from beginning to end, but it fell a bit short in terms of fun.|Fresh
The beauty of Cruise's performance is his ability to show physical wear and tear in small gestures. A slight limp, a hunch, a shiver.|Fresh
Sure the plot may be old hat, stolen from any number of 1990s action-thrillers, but with so much double-crossing, dastardly deeds and breathtaking stuntwork you'll hardly care as the near two-and-a-half hours flies by.|Fresh
The stunning design sensibility that has been poured into the set-piece action sequences of Fallout - and the thrilling stunt work powering them - are gifts that keep on giving throughout.|Fresh
It understands that the greatest backdrops in the world are useless if we don't care about the people in them.|Fresh
It's as polished, precision-tuned and effective a piece of filmmaking as you're likely to see all year long.|Fresh
McQuarrie keeps the action sequences, international intrigue, romantic subplots, etc., humming along at the perfect pace - one that doesn't give you too much time to think.|Fresh
IMF is WTF.|Rotten
The kind of exciting, adrenaline-pumping and visceral movie-going experience Mission: Impossible is known for and delivers|Fresh
The sixth film in the surprisingly venerable series is a bit more deliberate, but delivers the expected jolts and thrills.|Fresh
A near-perfect blend of old-school cliffhanger movie aesthetics with state of the art filmmaking technology...it joins Bourne, the Fast and the Furious, Transformers and the Dark Knight trilogy as a franchise setting the pace in the 21st century.|Fresh
A good movie but maybe one or two too many races, chases, etc.|Fresh
Even when Fallout is examining its characters in more depth than is necessary, it never lets up the pace. Consistent action with real stunts are the series' bread and butter, and McQuarrie is among the best at delivering this in a steady stream|Fresh
Goes to show that despite being a big, beefy blockbuster, you can still do something that's well shot and considered.|Fresh
I would argue that as this current version of Ethan Hunt, Cruise maintains that strong sense of right and wrong, but his aging fallibility matters far more.|Fresh
Part of the Mission: Impossible franchise's charm is that it has never bothered much with continuity.|Fresh
It has no desire to do anything new or polemical, but it gives us fans what we want -- Tom Cruise hanging off of things, the team back together, quick-witted deception antics, and a heavy dose of charm.|Fresh
Fallout is sure to be one of the best films of the summer.|Fresh
Regardless of whether you've been keeping notes on exactly who is doing what to who, by the time Fallout hits its straps - in a lengthy and stunningly choreographed motorbike chase through central Paris - you'll be too engrossed to really care.|Fresh
While this franchise has always maintained an almost serialized quality, under McQuarrie's direction, Mission: Impossible - Fallout also feels like the culmination and payoff of the five films that came before it.|Fresh
Cruise will never win an Oscar for playing Hunt, but what he does in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is surely at least as taxing as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio's role in The Revenant, with the added obligation of making it look like fun.|Fresh
It is true that maybe Fallout is not as great movie as we were led to believe, but it can't be denied that it is one of the best action movies of the day and that with all its faults It is extremely entertaining. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Thanks to charming, charismatic Tom Cruise, it's an intense action-adventure thrill ride.|Fresh
Breathtaking on the level of execution, if not inspiration.|Fresh
With three spectacular chase sequences...and some top-notch female casting, it's the best Mission: Impossible film since...well, since the last one, because that was very good too.|Fresh
"Over and over, Tom Cruise tells the screen, ""I won't let you down,"" and he never does, because we believe in him to deliver the goods."|Fresh
It's just the right balance of self awareness and genuine authenticity that makes for a thrilling entry in the franchise.|Fresh
Honestly, I don't know who's bigger - the series, or its leading man. But they're a match made in heaven.|Fresh
McQuarrie, an obvious cinephile, layers in a slew of subtle, tongue-in-cheek film references for the enlightened.|Fresh
It is rare that a movie leaves me so giddy and dumbstruck by the intricacies of its production|Fresh
When it comes to movie bangs for your buck, Cruise, bless his crazy cotton socks, delivers an atom bomb's worth of thrills.|Fresh
With this new release, Christopher McQuarrie... succeeds [in] embarking on an extremely fun movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The best [part] of this sixth adventure with Ethan Hunt... is that it seeks to round off different aspects that come from other films in the series, especially the previous one. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Fallout is about a broken man with delusions of grandeur who moves away from a woman who sees salvation in him to a woman who doesn't. This is a good conversation to have.|Fresh
A film so relentlessly entertaining that it might actually exhaust you. Believe the hype: this really is the best action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road.|Fresh
After five installments, you would think that a franchise would be way past its prime, but Mission Impossible is one of the rare exceptions.|Fresh
Essentially perfect.|Fresh
...dazzles with its intense drama and gorgeous, grand scale cinematography...|Fresh
"Cruise is a modern-day Buster Keaton, refusing to give self-preservation a single thought. In return, you're in a blissful state of amazement, repeatedly asking yourself, ""How in the heck did they pull that off?"""|Fresh
Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie inundates the screen with so many story twists and impressive action turns that there's no time or serious room to think about what's being witnessed.|Fresh
McQuarrie cleverly controls the ticking clock quality that makes these films so much fun.|Fresh
By combining a complex plot for thinkers, an action-adventure for thrill-seekers, and a buddy-comedy dynamic for those still on the fence, (it's) prebuilt to accomplish what few can: appeal to just about everyone and sacrifice nothing for it.|Fresh
Danny Boyle, Daniel Craig - it's your move.|Fresh
One of the very best action epics ever made. And I suspect, one of the best that will be made for an extremely long time to come.|Fresh
Ending with a trio of climaxes, M:I 6 justifies its lengthy running time by an outstanding marriage of creative writing and bravura execution.|Fresh
Jam-packed with jaw-dropping stunts and spectacular locations, this sixth in the franchise is a ripper: a welcome package of nonstop thrills, an intelligent story and Tom Cruise at his charismatic best.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible - Fallout reaffirms Tom Cruise as the greatest action star in movie history. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
[It] may not be a masterpiece of cinema, but it is smashing entertainment because all the money is up there on the screen.|Fresh
No disguising it. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the best yet. Tom Cruise is indefatiguable and proves Ethan Hunt rules.|Fresh
There isn't a single false step or cheap action beat; each one feels grand and exciting and perfectly paced. They almost feel in competition with one another to up the ante.|Fresh
I viewed it under Cruise control and couldn't resist all its Hollywood gusto and explosions.|Fresh
Not only is it the best movie of the summer, it's also one of the best action films of all time. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"The stunts are reminiscent of ""Fast and Furious"" via 'Tokyo drifting' cars, has the feel of ""Mad Max,"" while distinctly retaining its own identity with HALO jumps and more."|Fresh
"Mission: Impossible - Fallout might as well start with an epigraph that says ""Buckle up"" followed by a giant explosion and an air horn."|Fresh
...not an ounce of tension in this...car chases so plentiful and derivative they put you to sleep...the bad guy couldn't have been more obvious had he worn a sign...no more involving or entertaining than Buster Crabbe playing Flash Gordon.|Rotten
...the always hyperbolic action scenes are balanced with a few humorous notes that do not seem untimely interferences and with emotional strokes that are maintained several degrees by below sentimental overweight. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
McQuarrie and Cruise are determined to entertain us to within an inch of our lives, or die in the attempt.|Fresh
Sexy, witty and action-packed, the Mission: Impossible movies revel in glamorous locations and their star's billion-dollar smile, and Fallout is more of that.|Fresh
McQuarrie's masterful rush of action is built upon a gargantuan budget, yet beauty lies in the smallest details, such as the precision and coordination of the baroque action scenes that is is spatially coherent to a fault. The eye is jolted and soothed.|Fresh
In an age where the facsimile of spectacle can be produced via green screen, Cruise realizes there is no replacement for stunning vistas and genuine danger.|Fresh
McQuarrie has now directed two Mission: Impossible films; his understanding of the franchise and its characters proves to be the secret weapon of the series.|Fresh
Bless this franchise, we're truly not worthy.|Fresh
If a scene calls for people to parachute onto a building from 30,000 feet, why not throw in a lightning storm?|Fresh
In Mission Impossible 6, Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise deliver one of the biggest summer action movies ever seen. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The Mission Impossible series has been consistently thrilling. Fallout kicks everything up a level. It's ridiculously enjoyable.|Fresh
In the sixth installment of the saga, Tom Cruise returns as agent Ethan Hunt and gives the film a texture of realism thanks to his physical effort. Director Christopher McQuarrie reminds us why big-budget films can be interesting. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The series accomplishes if not the impossible then at least the highly unlikely by delivering more satisfying cinematic spy thrills in its sixth installment.|Fresh
A three-hour movie that doesn't feel like three hours...the best action movie this year, so far.|Fresh
Fallout is a determinedly old-fashioned action thriller that rarely stops to take a breath for fear that the loose ends of its twisted plot will be exposed. The always-on-the-go quality ensures momentum.|Fresh
In a time of lacklustre franchise offerings, it says a lot for MI6 that we can't wait for a part 7.|Fresh
Till he is physically capable, Tom Cruise will continue to accept such films, be sure of that...|Fresh
... A scintillating symphony of stunts, set pieces and action choreography.|Fresh
You can expect the nifty tricks that we've come to associate Hunt and the IMF with, but the moments I quite enjoyed were those of honesty and gentleness from the super spies.|Fresh
If there is an action movie to watch right now, then this is it.|Fresh
Brilliant. You're constantly on edge.|Fresh
A ticking time bomb of harrowing action, frazzled nerves, and edge-of-your-seat mystery. But, at the same time, it is way too long and its plot far too complex and convoluted|Fresh
[The] almost two and a half hours (the longest in the series) deliver an introspective and reflective film that is entertaining, and whose plot... never suffers from the frantic but perfectly framed action. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Completes possibly the most improbable cinematic hat trick in Hollywood history: An unpromising series that began with three patchy, uneven entries has now produced three terrifically entertaining ones.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a finely crafted entertainment machine meant to deliver summer-movie satisfaction, and after six chapters, I'm ready for more.|Fresh
Grows bolder and bigger, turning into a series of eye-rolling whoppers by the end.|Rotten
"""One saves the world; the other, entertains us as children in matinee. For Cruise / Hunt, it's the same""."|Fresh
The McDonald's hamburger of action movies. Well, maybe that's not entirely fair. Maybe the Wendy's.|Fresh
Tom Cruise is really good at running. This is what people refer to as perfect summer entertainment: big, long, splashy, and (overall) fun.|Fresh
While a sequel is pretty much guaranteed, it'll be a very tough to top this absolutely stellar installment...|Fresh
As summer franchise movies go, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is near the top of the heap... If the film has one overriding flaw, it's that it's about 20 minutes too long.|Fresh
Without a doubt, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the summer's best action movie!|Fresh
An entertaining ride that's near impossible to resist. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Mission Impossible: Fallout is like a nuclear fallout shelter against boredom. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Ethan Hunt will not only save the world, he'll do it in the most ridiculously dangerous and flamboyant way possible, with a lot of glass flying all over the place.|Fresh
I guess it depends on what your expectations of these films might be: The action is, as always, formidable, but without the same care given to the storyline, the film is a good deal less satisfying than some of the predecessors.|Fresh
The sixth movie in the Mission: Impossible series is a truly maximalist work of art. The plot is stupid but the stunts are terrifying, the tension vibratory, the muscles rippling. In short, it's a masterpiece.|Fresh
This is how Cruise returns to Zeus-level stardom. He gives his fans no stuntmen in masks and costumes. No green screen. Its him and he's spectacular.|Fresh
"Say what you will about ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" but at least its story took risks. ""Fallout"" offers a highly predictable form of fun -- although it's still fun."|Fresh
Tom Cruise is as ageless as this remarkably fresh franchise.|Fresh
Once again, Cruise pours every ounce of adrenaline-junkie effort onto the screen, skydiving, riding motorcycles, climbing cliffs, flying helicopters and yes, running really fast.|Fresh
Fallout is not only (easily) the best pure action movie of Summer 2018, it's also the perfect culmination of the Mission: Impossible films thus far.|Fresh
"""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is a propulsive viewing experience, captured at a true break-neck pace."|Fresh
Cruise tumbles through the overly complicated globe-skipping action flick as though he's collecting punches on the Break A Bone On Every Continent Rewards Card.|Fresh
"While the stakes certainly are high, ""Fallout"" turns up the fun with references to the increasingly implausible lengths to which Ethan and his team will go to save the world."|Fresh
You can just feel the care and craftsmanship in every scene, like when you eat a fancy meal or drive an expensive car.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible has become the blue-chip action franchise of the 21st century. Choose to accept it.|Fresh
There's nothing to think about. You just set your mouth to AGAPE and lean back.|Fresh
Froths with terrific, clattering violence that - staged with as little CGI as possible - makes competing summer flicks ... feel like clouds of generic software.|Fresh
Quick pacing and impeccable action scenes compensate for predictability.|Fresh
A seamless, wildly entertaining summer blockbuster that won't soon be forgotten.|Fresh
if you're looking for high-octane action, filled with unpredictable surprises, this is the film. Scene after scene becomes one mind-blowing experience after another.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible - Fallout has some of the most stunning action ever put on film - Nolanesque in tone, paced like a bullet, and breathtaking in IMAX.|Fresh
We're back for the sixth episode of Ethan Hunt's continued battle against the bad guys and, bloody hell, if it hasn't just gone and delivered the best action film of the year so far . . .|Fresh
This sixth outing for Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his disaster averting/disaster causing Impossible Missions Force is up there with JJ Abrams's Mission: Impossible III as a contender for the best of the bunch.|Fresh
Even the bladder-bursting 147-minute running time of Mission: Impossible - Fallout can be forgiven, given the number of thrilling action sequences it facilitates.|Fresh
Fallout is the perfect Mission: Impossible sequel; so good it makes knees wobble and (broken) ankles heal.|Fresh
Fallout is thrilling in a way that is out of sync with blockbuster fashions. It doesn't try for any sort of political resonance, and while it's a more direct sequel than past installments, there's still nothing you really need to know in advance.|Fresh
Watch Mission: Impossible - Fallout to experience old-fashioned action cinema at its best. Just be prepared to be strapped in for longer than you're used to.|Fresh
"Plenty of pleasures apart from pure action turn up in the film, which, like the previous episode, ""Rogue Nation,"" was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie."|Fresh
Astounding, gripping, heart-pounding set pieces.|Fresh
The relative lack of CGI, the way bodies run and leap and climb and slam into things in this movie makes you catch your breath.|Fresh
Fallout may be the most viscerally satisfying blockbuster sequel since James Cameron changed the whole game with Terminator 2.|Fresh
Cruise's inexhaustible appetite for creating wow-worthy stunts and action-packed set-pieces doesn't disappoint.|Fresh
It's a difficult task to keep viewers connected to a sprawling series and to put together two and a half hours of solid thrills and surprises with a good level of emotional investment. That's exactly what M:I 6 has done.|Fresh
It's all so godd---ed beautiful. I love these movies.|Fresh
It's a rare beast for a Hollywood blockbuster to leave me speechless. Mission: Impossible - Fallout did exactly that.|Fresh
The Mission: Impossible movies are not emotional experiences, but a visceral expression of Cruise's dogged desire to remain an action star. Even with top-notch filmmakers at the helm, he's become the true auteur of this series.|Fresh
And, bless him, Cruise should be an inspiration for any AARP member. He is the best runner in movies. When he begins to sprint, you are impressed by the clenched jaw, the legs churning like pistons and the arms propelling him forward.|Fresh

Better than Bourne, better even than Bond - this is the definitive spy thriller and will be remembered as one of the year's best films.|Fresh
Cruise once again shows that being 56-years-old is no barrier to being an action hero while the movie itself proves that being a summer blockbuster cash cow that doesn't veer wildly from the unexpected doesn't have to be uninspired.|Fresh

Among the most spectacular action pictures of all time.|Fresh
...you'll wonder if you can ever respect CGI-assisted stunt work again.|Fresh
"Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is the sixth film of the series, and, quite possibly, the best. Maybe only rivaled by Brad Bird's ""Ghost Protocol."" Nah, know what? I think we have a new champ. ""Fallout"" is THAT good."|Fresh
The Inception of the franchise...|Fresh
It's breathtaking stuff that not only demands a second viewing (and a follow up) but also confirms Tom Cruise as the true Hollywood action star that he deserves to be.|Fresh
Fallout proves deliberately dizzying, not just with its oft-vertiginous action, but in its outrageous plotting, its deliriously absurd entanglements of double agents, double crosses, and just plain doubles...|Fresh

In Fallout, Tom Cruise literally falls from space down to Earth, a visual metaphor that is hardly coincidental, because if there's one takeaway from this chapter, it's that Cruise, or rather Ethan Hunt, is human after all. Kind of.|Fresh

With the sixth Mission: Impossible installment in the books, the question is where the franchise goes after Fallout continues to raise the bar.|Fresh
Everything a summer action picture should be|Fresh

If they had a competition for the all-time all-action blockbuster, Fallout would be in with a very plausible shout. Suck it up, James Bond.|Fresh
Tom Cruise is still at the top of his game - not to mention the top a Paris skyscraper and a snow-capped mountain in Kashmir.|Fresh
A cinematic centrifuge of acrobatic stunt work, breakneck chases and immersive action, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a perfectly calibrated piece of filmmaking that plays the viewer like a drum right from the start.|Fresh
Fallout... isn't the best of the bunch (that would be number four, Brad Bird's Ghost Protocol), but it's easily the second-best and certainly the Cruise-iest, meaning it's nearly as entertaining as it is strenuous. Which is a mighty high bar!|Fresh

The Mission: Impossible series reconfirms its status as one of the all-time great action franchises with one jaw-dropping thrill sequence after another.|Fresh

Fallout confirms that lightning can strike twice and that it will be nearly impossible that any other action film this year will be able to top it.|Fresh
This latest installment of the Mission Impossible franchise is unmitigated fun with its deliciously overwrought motorcycle chases, hellish helicopter skirmishes, frenzied fisticuffs, plus rooftop jumpings galore.|Fresh
I enjoyed watching the movie. If you're a fan of the franchise, go watch it in the theater...but predictable, not as clever as the other ones.|Fresh
I could be up for ten more of these movies. I love seeing these.|Fresh
The M:I franchise is now 22 years old, but it isn't folding anytime soon.|Fresh

McQuarrie brings grace and grit, and Cruise brings it, period. This quick-witted, fleet-footed franchise shows no sign of flagging.|Fresh

The thriller version of comfort film. It's something we can return to with complete confidence in what we're getting into.|Fresh
Even with its faults, Mission Impossible: Fallout delights the audience with the over-the-top excitement and armrest gripping action.|Fresh
It never quite improves upon or distinguishes itself from previous entries in the decades-old franchise, but seeing Tom Cruise perform the Impossible still entertains.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible - Fallout is going to blow audiences out of their chairs. The action scenes are stupefyingly awesome.|Fresh

It's filled with gasp-inducing motorcycle chases, kinetic car sequences, and bruising, brutal combat.|Fresh
You'll leave the theater delightfully exhausted after spending almost the entire length... frantically piecing together the plot, feeling your adrenaline pumping during the action scenes, and gripping the seat from constant tension.|Fresh
Cruise's dynamic with Cavill is one of the film's highlights, making you think this is The Man From U.N.C.L.E. movie that should have been made...Fallout is an improvement on all the previous film's failings, drawing together all the best aspects of them.|Fresh
It misses no opportunity to prop up Cruise's indomitable earthly ego while his character runs, jumps, falls, fist-fights, sky-dives, and clambers up rope and cliff in service of...what exactly?|Rotten
Yes, Fallout is bonkers and you'll want to be caught in its preposterous, but intense blast radius.|Fresh
Cruise is back to the chase, a star on a mission, and summer suddenly feels fun again.|Fresh
Against all odds, Fallout continues Mission: Impossible's ongoing streak of extremely rewarding returns.|Fresh
As relentless and intense an action movie as you've seen since Mad Max: Fury Road.|Fresh
OK, McQuarrie may not have De Palma's sweat-drop precision, John Woo's craziness or the impish wit of Brad Bird, but his mastery of logistics here is easily sufficient to make it the blockbuster of the summer.|Fresh

Works as the zippiest and most satisfying blockbuster you're certain to see this summer. What it misses in plot, it lands in character and spirit.|Fresh
It delivers. More than that, it's become the rare franchise that seems to just get better, twistier, and more deliriously fun with each installment.|Fresh
Fallout's pleasures are gratifyingly straightforward, direct without being dumbed-down. It's a meat-and-potatoes banquet, one that doesn't need to be interesting to be satisfying.|Fresh
Not since Fury Road have such viscerally practical effects been put to better use by such deliriously impractical people.|Fresh
"I think ""Oh, gosh, do we need another one of these?"" And then I see that movie and I say ""Yes, of course, you idiot. Of course we need another one of these."""|Fresh
Here, with everything that he's ever cared about on the line, Hunt proves why he's summer's most valuable action hero.|Fresh
The action here represents the mainstream cinema's version of extreme sports and these guys have staked their claim at the summit.|Fresh

McQuarrie's film is the most fun you're likely to have at the movies this season, a riot mounted with precision, a melee in which every punch and crunch is considered.|Fresh

Just when you think Rogue Nation may have been too tough an act to follow, Fallout takes it to yet another level.|Fresh
Clearly the best ongoing action franchise in the world.|Fresh
Mission: Impossible - Fallout is cocked, locked and ready to blow you away with more than just Henry Cavill's forearms.|Fresh
