A warm-hearted documentary about a down-to-earth photographer who used Polaroids to shoot her portraits.|Fresh
Dorfman talks like a philosopher at times, but never seems to take herself, or anything else, very seriously, except for the death of film. She talks about the loss of film and all the wonderful machinery thrown away when Polaroid went bankrupt.|Fresh
"Image after image of luminaries from her earlier career fade away as she pulls out what she calls ""the b-sides,"" akin to the extra song on the back of a popular record."|Fresh
While we often think of artistic genius in terms of big, earth-shaking masterpieces, the film shows the value in assembling a body of work, day after day, photo by photo, over the course of a life.|Fresh
B-Side may not rank with Morris' best films, but it stands as an introduction to Dorfman's approach and work. Think of it as a revealing miniature about a woman who made very large photographs. Posted by Robert Dene|Fresh
Forges a penetrating, enriching human connection between the viewer and the subject.|Fresh
[Elsa] Dorfman's a fascinating character whose sunny demeanor, much like her generally cheerful photos, contains hidden depths.|Fresh
You don't have to be an artistic type to appreciate this affectionate documentary.|Fresh
"Perhaps the subject isn't for every taste, but Morris appears to understand inherent exclusivity, keeping ""The B-Side"" biographical but also visual, allowing time for the audience to grasp the specificity and serenity of Dorfman's work."|Fresh
It manages to feel quietly moving and quietly profound in unexpected ways, and I think it is Morris's best film in a long time.|Fresh

Morris' film also functions as an elegy for Polaroid and the large-format imagery that has now ceased to exist as a result of the company's demise.|Fresh
There is an elegant, simple beauty in documentarian Errol Morris's affectionate portrait of his friend, soft-spoken, 80-year-old Elsa Dorfman, in his new film.|Fresh
There is a consistent quality to the images, and even to their subjects, which is echoed by Dorfman's own philosophy.|Fresh
The mood is light and breezy, with Dorfman being as funny as she is candid. But there's an inescapable air of sadness lurking beneath the surface.|Fresh
Directed by famed documentarian Errol Morris, The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman's Portrait Photography is a perfect match of filmmaker and subject.|Fresh
Morris must go into Dorfman's home court, the cozy backyard studio where she has decades worth of work stored. As a result, he gets a more intimate portrait of an unassuming artist whose pictures are far bigger than her ego.|Fresh
Another fascinating non-fiction effort from the Academy Award winning master Errol Morris.|Fresh
"...about a true artist for which her beloved cameras were ""the implement that allows you to eat the soup. It is not the soup,"""|Fresh
like discovering the incredible history of an old friend.|Fresh
More than any of Morris's films, The B-Side is directly about the mystery of capturing a person's identity on film...This likeable close-up portrait may not be one of his most substantial films, but it's his most likeable and most casual.|Fresh
The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman's Portrait Photography doesn't delve deep, but the film serves as a fine story of success and the end of an era...|Fresh
"Part character study and social expose, ""The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman's Portrait Photography"" examines the artistic process of a woman whose divinely quirky personality informs her formerly overlooked career."|Fresh
Compact and so vast, so bittersweet and so kind and giving, a brilliantly casual portrait of Morris' cheery friend and Cambridge neighbor. [A] deceptively simple gem.|Fresh
The B-Side shows glimmers of beauty and poignancy that are drowned in an overwhelmingly sense of stagnancy.|Rotten
In its quiet, charming way, this is a sad, dark Errol Morris movie, about loss and change and aging out of one's profession.|Fresh
An octogenarian pioneer of instamatic photography as art is glowingly featured in this likeable doc.|Fresh
"Lovely portrait of a haimish artist, self-described ""nice Jewish girl,"" friendly and homey...most charming centerpiece is the montage of the everyday people... who hired her."|Fresh
There's a lot more movie contained within this charming oddity, but only for those who are willing to look deeper.|Fresh
The film is tinged with a sense of fragility -- the luckiness of the shot, the delicate nature of the prints, the high probability that someone is blinking, and the very nature of photography itself.|Fresh
Even at only 76 minutes, The B-Side feels a tad overextended-but it's a pleasure to see a warm, creative, and not even remotely evasive individual in front of [Morris'] signature Interrotron camera for a change.|Fresh
If Errol Morris' new film is a relatively minor work by his standards, then its bittersweet, faintly lilting tone is here to remind viewers of the big heart that's always been there in his oeuvre.|Fresh
Errol Morris films Dorfman and her work with a rapt attentiveness that maps the nostalgic and regretful stirrings of her soul.|Fresh
This film will convince you that she definitely deserves a higher position in the pantheon.|Fresh
The depth of her art reflects a life richly lived, as does the wisdom of her epigrammatic musings.|Fresh
The B-Side is on the dull side given that it's largely a one-hander but its central character does give the audience insight into how a photographer can capture a person's soul.|Fresh
If this doc is sometimes elegiac in tone, there is nothing mournful about it.|Fresh
She also ended up with a stash of that Polaroid product, but now that it's almost gone, Dorfman herself ends up a scratchy B-side of the lapsed century. But that's not fair, Morris seems to argue. She was a hitmaker from the start.|Fresh
Her stories are great, especially the one about Dorfman gate-crashing Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975. It would have been nice to hear more of them.|Fresh
"After seeing so many ""B-Side photos,"" the portraits with slight flaws in them that Dorfman keeps, they all start to blur together, which does a disservice to Morris' film and Dorfman's work."|Rotten
[Morris'] film makes for a fittingly positive monument to [Dorfman's] often overlooked and under-appreciated work, but this intimate conversation and reflection also allows him to also do so much more.|Fresh
It's a film with much to say, about the shifting winds of technology, the challenges of art that stands the tests of time, and how we choose to think about the lives we've lived.|Fresh
fitfully-fascinating|Fresh
Short-circuiting any self-seriousness and using food metaphors to explain her theories of art, Dorfman gives The B-Side life and energy.|Fresh
Discount it at your peril: This portrait of the artist as an old woman is a gentle-hearted gem, as profoundly subtle as it is subtly profound.|Fresh
Not only is it an affectionate and personal film - the subject, Elsa Dorfman, is a long-standing friend and Morris's emotional investment in her story is evident in every frame.|Fresh
From defying gender expectation in her younger years to refusing to let tragedy shape her as she matures, Dorfman is a force, and spending time with her is an invaluable experience.|Fresh
