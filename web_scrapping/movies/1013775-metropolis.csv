For years audiences have wondered how good this film might have been had it not been edited. It turns out that it's better than anyone could ever have expected.|Fresh

. . . the film is still something to behold, even if the newly restored footage occasionally looks like someone ran over it with a brillo pad.|Fresh
Lang's allegory of allegories posits humanity's progress as a collision not just of labor and management but of technology and sorcery|Fresh
"[VIDEO ESSAY] Although it ends with an overwrought climax, topped off with a laughably banal clich that unites the workers with their greedy overlord, ""Metropolis"" is filled with stunning archetypal imagery and grand-scale spectacle."|Fresh
Metropolis remains the benchmark of agenda-driven extravaganzas, stirring and fun in the right spots.|Fresh

Here is the starting-point of so much modern cinema.|Fresh
Lang is at fever pitch. Although the film is renowned for its architecture -- and thus has a reputation for being static -- what makes it seductive is how much organic energy Lang and his collaborators put into the imagery.|Fresh

A visionary science-fiction spectacle; a still relevant dramatization of 'class warfare'; a pulp nightmare of Freudian-Marxist-Christian symbolism and Expressionist-Futurist-Old Testament imagery; and a source of inspiration for Nazis and Utopians alike.|Fresh
Here for the first time the chill mechanized world of the future... has been given reality. Here is the city, that tormented circus of buildings which touch the sky, of tunnels that disrupt the places under the earth.|Fresh

A luminous and resplendent visual masterpiece yoked to a puerile and embarrassingly trite plot.|Fresh

This movie is certifiably nuts and naive in many ways, but it is so exciting.|Fresh
Anyone who thinks they truly love movies must get their hands on the restored edition of this timeless film. You will not be disappointed.|Fresh
The new release of Metropolis, fully restored to just shy of Fritz Lang's original vision, is an example of the grandest telepathy: what was thought to be lost forever.|Fresh

See it on the big screen if you can.|Fresh

The true stars here are Fritz Lang's grandiosity of conception, the camerawork by Karl Freund and Gnther Rittau, and the symmetrical sets and special-visual effects.|Fresh

Moralistic science fiction at its maddest, Fritz Lang's ambitious silent classic Metropolis still has the power to impress us with its inspired art direction and its expressionistic vision.|Fresh

Few films have ever been more visually exhilarating.|Fresh
