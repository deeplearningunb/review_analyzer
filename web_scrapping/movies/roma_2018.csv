Rooted in Cuarón's memories, Roma is a love letter to the woman who raised him and the city he called home.|Fresh
Much of the narrative plays like a cinematic diary of Cleo's day-to-day life; the camera, a compassionate observer thoughtfully taking note of the moments of transcendence within the ordinariness of a life of devoted service.|Fresh
The fact is, the film really just needs to be seen to fully appreciate Cuaron's artistry in making the everyday seem profound.|Fresh
If you can see it on the big screen, you'll be rewarded. Partly because it looks so great, and partly because it's a sedate film that needs a real investment by the viewer.|Fresh
"The astounding size of the purse to promote ""Roma"" paid off with a nomination and other awards, but it buys me little appreciation except for the downright beauty of the black and white imagery."|Rotten
Roma is an impressive cinematic achievement: a revolutionary movie for contemporary mexican cinema and an intimate reflection on Mexico City's history, sounds, divisions and feelings. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The black-and-white spectacle captures the memory of childhood, in unflinching clarity.|Fresh
A beautiful glimpse into middle class malaise in 1970s Mexico, Cuarón shows an affinity for the simplicity of life then and the complexity that often creates waves.|Fresh
Breathtaking cinematography captures the most anxious, harrowing, loving, even banal moments and bathes them in shimmering beatific light. But Roma also insists on being a narrative. And that requires more than just pretty pictures.|Fresh
You will have to wait for things to get going but, when they do, this film becomes a tapestry of emotion executed in sublime style.|Fresh

It's beautiful story, he shot it himself along side writing and directing, at this stage we can see it in a bunch of different places, its on Netflix & in theaters, but go see it in theaters!|Fresh
An incidental thread that serves as an excuse for the director to capture on screen an amalgam of memories and a veritable whirlwind of sensations on the surface. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Stories like [Cleo's] are often erased from history, and it is a painful joy to see them told with dignity and loving detail.|Fresh
Roma, from writer/director Alfonso Cuarón, is a warm and loving memoir to Mexico City, where he grew up and was cared for by women who loved him and his siblings.|Fresh
There is sadness and some humor in Roma.|Fresh
To Roma's credit, Cleo is not a sidekick or played for laughs. She's in the foreground.|Fresh
Aparicio, in her acting debut, is remarkable.|Fresh
A beautiful yet unromantic look back at Cuarón's childhood, and a gorgeous tribute to the woman who helped raise him.|Fresh
Kudos to Cuaron for crafting such a visually-captivating, surreal memoir of his troubled coming of age!|Fresh
Roma essentially has no plot, but it doesn't need one. Cuarón has reached back into his memories and made a finely crafted tribute.|Fresh
Cuaron's love of long takes - demonstrated so masterfully in Children of Men & Gravity - allows you to soak in all the subtly placed detail about the lives of these people...his understated use of the camera engineers some great cinematic moments.|Fresh
As it stands, it's a beautiful film that's so preoccupied with creating a realistic, immersive world of sights and sounds that it forgets to make its central character an actual person.|Fresh
There'll be plenty to write about Roma in the days to come aside from this brief reaction, but I'm so excited for you to get to see this film: It's truly astonishing.|Fresh
It's a piece of cinema that, whilst mostly grounded in the mundane, finds the grandeur and cinematic potential in every conceivable moment.|Fresh
"While ""Roma"" is a deeply personal expression of one man's childhood memories, I responded to it, from today's climate, as a very affecting way of viewing a woman's dilemma of work versus motherhood."|Fresh
The director, Alfonso Cuaron, brings the audience into the world of his childhood in Mexico City's Roma neighborhood through masterful blending of the intricacies of power dynamics in class, ethnicity, politics, family and gender.|Fresh
despite being gorgeously shot and genuinely earnest in its drama, it is too much in Cuarón's head|Rotten
Both intimately small and sweepingly epic.|Fresh
The result, albeit a masterpiece, is a textbook example of the male gaze and the inflated masculine ego behind it.|Fresh
Cuarón has made more entertaining movies for sure, but none so heartfelt and even soulful.|Fresh
Every frame of the film could be isolated and hung on a wall, and maybe that's what should be done with it. Roma is a beautiful boring movie.|Rotten
The simple and realistic storytelling discloses individual complexities that made me care for these characters with all my soul.|Fresh
Could a Netflix movie win the best film Oscar come February 24? You better believe it.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón's Roma is a soulful cinematic prayer. It's an open letter which embraces and reverences childhood, class struggles and politics.|Fresh
For all of the highlights on Cuarón's resume, Roma sees the director enter another realm.|Fresh
...a masterful endeavor from a seriously talented filmmaker.|Fresh
Cuarón fills every corner of the frame, just as Fellini did, so that the eye has to roam the screen as though scouring a fresco. But for all the bustle and brio, it's a visually lucid movie.|Fresh
It is ravishingly shot and at times deeply moving.|Fresh
However easy it is to dismiss a static or slow camera as performing attentiveness, it works - I have never looked so hard at soapsuds.|Fresh
It feels like something students will be studying in film school for many years to come and yet unlike many arthouse pieces it made me cry. I was invested in these people and their lives|Fresh
Cuaron is a bit too close to the material, and most moviegoers will have to do a lot of research to truly get and appreciate the movie. Still, a true work of art.|Fresh
With beautifully profound storytelling, strong characterizations, meticulous attention to period detail and heartfelt direction, Roma is one of the best films of 2018 and it deserves all the praise from critics.|Fresh
Roma is an act of understanding-an investigation by Cuarón of where he came from, and of what and who made him-and it's moving in the way that an honest and generous investigation of that kind can be.|Fresh
So much happens in Roma. It is so bursting with life, Mexican life.|Fresh
A wonderful homage to our most precious commodity and superb cinematography|Fresh
This time, it's personal.|Fresh
There are many memorable images in the film that stuck with me after the film was over. Roma is full of life and love -- ordinary, down to earth people in extraordinary circumstances.|Fresh
Roma builds to a celebration of simple virtues that are so undervalued in the current socio-political climate... And Cuarón observes these values in practice, with artistry and perception.|Fresh
If it wasn't clear before, then Roma is a gorgeous guarantee that achieving technical perfection is Alfonso Cuarón's one true goal.|Fresh
Set in the comfortable upper middle-class neighbourhood of Roma in Mexico City, this compelling story centres on a marriage slowly splintering apart and the native Latina live-in maid who stands at the swirling heart of the family for whom she works.|Fresh
Haunting, poetic, and a film impossible to forget.|Fresh
Given Cuaron's stunning wide-screen black-and-white cinematography and the film's meticulous Dolby Atmos sound design, Roma is definitely worth a trip to the theater, but mostly, it just quietly demands to be seen.|Fresh
There is no cloying dialogue, or artificial moments and characters. Every moment is real.|Fresh
Small in scale but enormous in its emotional impact, this drama from one of Mexico's top film-makers is a masterclass in how everyday events, shot in a natural, unforced way, can make for gripping cinema.|Fresh
I feel like Roma is a perfect example of how a director can re-examine aspects of their life and people who influenced their life without turning everything into a stereotypical mess.|Fresh
Like a great dish made out of the fewest, purest ingredients.|Fresh
Shot in black and white (Cuarón served as cinematographer as well as writer and director), it's an intense memory piece, dealing with the challenging subjects of class, race, and gender, in an evolving country without preaching or even taking a side.|Fresh
Oscar-winning writer/director Alfonso Cuarón's breathtakingly poignant and personal Roma will move you to the core.|Fresh
Powerful because it is so personal. Cuaron is drawing from his own life to portray the Mexico of the 1970s he remembers. Filled with social hierarchy and political unrest.|Fresh
The amount of praise the film has received is not justified because the story is mediocre and feels very pretentious. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Cuaron is masterly in building up a climax without any plot virtuosities or overt stylish broad brushes.|Fresh
A political protest, an emergency at a hospital and a dramatic beach scene achieve the seemingly impossible balance of being intimate and grand.|Fresh
Roma is, for better or worse, Cinderella for the 21st century. It's a powerful film, beautiful and compelling, but to what ends is difficult to say.|Fresh
The thing that Cuarón chooses to highlight the most is the strength of women, and how they are left to pick up after the messes that men make and refuse to take responsibility for.|Fresh
Moving quietly through a year in Cleo's life and using beautiful black-and-white cinematography, the film is deeply emotional but rigorously unsentimental.|Fresh
Cuarón's camera switches back and forth from long, deliberate takes interspersed with short, action-filled sequences. The black and white photography is simply gorgeous and exactly right for the story.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón doesn't so much recreate his childhood in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City as he reimagines it...|Fresh
Roma stars a Oaxacan woman of color who pierces the idea of a nebulous Latino or Hispanic identity.|Fresh
Even for someone as accomplished as Cuarón,  Roma  stands out as one of more remarkable pieces of filmmaking in recent memory.|Fresh
The detailed artistry is outstanding, but visionary flair coupled with poignant authenticity doesn't necessarily make an entertaining movie.|Fresh
"""Maybe the masterpiece of Alfonso Cuarón""."|Fresh
A movie like Roma is rare - something that's intimate yet also grand.|Fresh
Having broken through the haze of childhood memory, Cuarón knows that those forces of power - and the race, class, and gender dynamics they set in motion - define the complex intimate relationships between domestic workers and their employers.|Fresh
Roma is the kind of movie that comes just a few times in a generation and forms part of a canon of masterpieces.|Fresh
A film that deserves to be seen by anyone who cares about cinema.|Fresh
Director Alfonso Cuaron has made a full-on masterpiece with this heartbreaking, semi-autobiographical knockout.|Fresh
If Alfonso Cuaron's Roma could be reviewed in one line, it would be this: Give the Oscar out now and save us all staying up late next year.|Fresh
Above all else, Roma is an extraordinary visual experience.|Fresh
A cinematic valentine to a Mexican maid whose kindness has a positive impact on all those around her.|Fresh
By making Roma so specific to his own memory, Cuarón has created a mesmerizing, powerful, universal story.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuaron's heartfelt ode to the Mexico City of his childhood and the women who influenced him is unlike any other movie you will see this year. That's a good thing.|Fresh
It offers an increasingly rare combination of ambition, imagination, compassion, emotion and execution.|Fresh
"Cuaron brings new definition to what is considered a ""spectacle"". Indeed, Roma is spectacular."|Fresh
A complete experience, merging an offering of love and empathy with the sharpness of large-scale filmmaking, presented in a way few could pull off like Cuaron.|Fresh
An incredibly emotional story, which manages to perfectly convey the social differences that exist in countries like Mexico. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Worth seeing in any format, Roma is best when viewed on the biggest possible screen with the least amount of distractions.|Fresh
In Roma, Cuarón has crafted not just a great feat of cinema, but a work that's destined to be savored and pored over for decades to come.|Fresh
It is a highly emotional and enthralling love letter...|Fresh
The personal connection of Alfonso Cuarón with the story moves to the screen in such a way that everything looks endearing and familiar. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
I urge you to enjoy it on a big screen and more importantly as part of the communal experience that film - and especially this film - is meant to be.|Fresh
It highlights how such projects can be used for self-reflection that's actually relevant to society. If it can be used to examine privilege, then it can lead to striking, honest works of beauty such as Roma.|Fresh
The art direction in Rome is amazing. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Yes. It's a remarkable film, both intimate and epic, that is moving and often surprising.|Fresh
Sometimes this feels like artifice, but the emotions are real enough, and Cuaron's tribute to Cleo, and to women like her, is heartfelt.|Fresh
"Childhood memories are powerful markers of identity and experiences; thanks to""Roma""for evoking such while one is unaware, as it works magic in creating new imagery to sustain them."|Fresh
While the film portrays the larger picture of Mexico's sociopolitical issues, above all else, it's a personal movie.|Fresh
This is an exceptional movie, powerful and stark, and beautiful.|Fresh
Cuaron's signature long takes immerse the viewer in this environment, the camera slowly panning to drink in the details of this world he's recreated from his memory.|Fresh
"...the vast majority of movie-goers will not find Roma accessible at all...another ""critic"" movie that applauds abstract art and serves in-part as Cuaron hero-worship."|Fresh
There is quite simply no other film like this being made right now, and few directors with the reach and ability to achieve it.|Fresh
I can't recall another art movie so openly patronizing toward its subject, yet so self-flattering of its maker's largesse.|Rotten
A vivid exploration of the world Cuaron came from and is bound to be a signature achievement for the director, who has managed to put together a captivating film that is thoughtful both in substance and style.|Fresh
Crafted with stunning detail, [Cuarón] infuses substance into each scene.|Fresh
There isn't much talking in Roma, nor are there many close-ups of the characters - faces and words are forgotten as time passes; and Alfonso Cuaron wants his film to feel like a half-remembered dream, washed away by the tide of time.|Fresh
Cuaron's memory movie is a beautiful thing, and he does some fine camerawork as well.|Fresh
A powerful piece of cinema.|Fresh
It's a slice of life. You just watch everything unfold and it's beautiful.|Fresh
I felt bad for the dog.|Rotten
This Netflix original lacks agency within its' character beats that have a frustrating passivity to the narrative. [Alfonso] Cuarón's film comes to the brink of being cruel to its setting and characters.|Rotten
Cuarón is dangling a cathartic hook as Cleo 'overcomes' personal tragedy with a heroic gesture. But the whiff of injustice still lingers at the film's end - to me, at least.|Fresh
Roma isn't just a film, it's a tidal wave of empathy with an undeniable sense of momentum, worth watching on the biggest screen you can find.|Fresh
A stellar and brilliant visual experience and deeply moving tale...|Fresh
It's a love letter to mothers when all is said and done: biological and otherwise. And it succeeds in large part due to a stunning debut performance by Aparicio.|Fresh
This is a film that is more fun to study than to be entertained by. It may be art but it is not great entertainment.|Fresh
Roma is small life drama writ large.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón's edgily political black-and-white epic of a family in 1970s Mexico City is as masterfully choreographed as Children of Men but more personally intimate.|Fresh
A series of beautiful, gorgeous shots stitched together that excellently mask a thin story and largely uninteresting characters - Yalitza Aparicio aside.|Rotten
It doesn't matter how you see it; Alfonso Cuarón's latest is a movie that turns you inside out, revealing a personal story on a grand scale.|Fresh
Perfection. Cinema doesn't get as rich as this.|Fresh
Roma is, hands down, in the top cinematic tier.|Fresh
Cuaron obviously is one of the boys in this on-screen family, but Roma isn't about children or even childhood; it's a movie about a moment and the people who lived it.|Fresh
Aparicio had never acted before taking on the role and that raw talent makes her mastery of character all the more remarkable - if ever a film proved that the camera can read minds it's Roma.|Fresh
Roma unfolds so naturally, so realistically, and so affectingly that it's best seen and heard on its own terms. So see it big, and see it loud.|Fresh
Pristine imagery carries this gorgeous-looking, but small and sleepy tale from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuaron. His very personal story, in fact, might not connect as easily as his camera.|Fresh
A feat of filmmaking so accomplished it borders on showing off, but also a deeply rewarding piece of filmmaking...|Fresh
"""Roma"" is magnificent."|Fresh
This year's gaga film is Roma.|Rotten
It's an emotional roller coaster full of wonder and sorrow that feels like Cuarón rediscovering distant memories from his own childhood.|Fresh
It's visually and auditorily captivating, pushing your emotional understanding to its limits.|Fresh
At-once nostalgic and fresh, Roma finds transcendence in the mundane moments of everyday lives and ordinary people ... It is a beautiful celebration of peoplehood and place in an often place-less world.|Fresh
If you don't allow yourself 135 minutes this weekend to soak it in, we can't be friends.|Fresh
A textbook example of Roger Ebert's description of cinema as an empathy machine, opening a window onto a world most of us would never otherwise know even existed.|Fresh
A generous and lovingly made film.|Fresh
We are all passengers on this beautiful trip down memory lane at the invitation of Cuarón. Oh, how lucky are we who can accompany him. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Roma is an exciting look at family dynamics, a fascinating record of a convulsive time, an exploration of class differences, prevailing sexism, and contained violence. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Beautifully photographed and masterfully directed, Roma is Alfonso Cuaron's most personal and emotional film to date. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Roma, the film of the year, is an exquisitely tender work, and a deeply layered historical re-creation.|Fresh
A powerful, beautiful personal odyssey.|Fresh
The images may be truly breathtaking to behold, but cinema requires more than mere beauty. There is no there there, merely a vacant (if splendid) filmic vessel.|Rotten
This beautiful new movie-probably the best of the year-is far more than a collection of memorial fragments.|Fresh
You allow the movie's sights and smells to envelop you in a world surrounded by turmoil and tragedy but held together by love and loyalty.|Fresh
Roma demonstrates that great filmmaking can work on us almost subliminally, narrowing the distance between us and the screen.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón's Roma is a magical film that weaves memories of a childhood as idyllic as it is raw... in a world where silences prevail in homes accompanied by the endless murmurs and din of the streets. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cuarón does not conjure up nostalgia or false sentiment. He mixes personal melodrama with epic scale, creating gripping sequences where normalcy suddenly experiences tectonic shifts.|Fresh
Roma is Cuarón's love letter to his nanny, to his mother, to his siblings, and to Mexico. It's as pure as cinema can get.|Fresh
A marvelous film and definitely one of the best of 2018. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Roma is the sort of movie filmmakers and critics love, and audiences have to endure. Alfonso Cuarón's semi-autobiographical effort plays like a home movie that runs on and on, seemingly without organization or end.|Rotten
Roma is more impressive as a feat of crowd control than as a piece of visual storytelling or as a character study; it's a film that's easier to admire than to fall in love with.|Rotten
Roma is one of the year's best movies.|Fresh
Cuarón pens a brilliant and touching love letter about Mexico City, family and motherhood. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's been such a long time that I've really seen a movie like this.|Fresh
It's a beautiful film that doesn't have to overstate its affection for the experience that the director had.|Fresh
In spite of everything, the director achieves in Roma the difficult feat of evoking the past with one foot in nostalgia and the other in the critical sense. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Rome is a striking example of how a filmmaker can use all the tools at his disposal to tell a story full of humanity and heart, involving the viewer and bringing him closer to a temporary cut with much to analyze. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Cuarón's film is quotidian and extraordinary at the same time. It is about change and how we adapt and grow. It is about love and sometimes the lack of it. It is a rapturous magnum opus, that is heartbreaking, devastating, and life affirming all at once.|Fresh
Told through the impassive eyes of a live-in maid, it's the slow-moving and apparently autobiographical story of a middle-class family enduring earthquakes, bad parking and marital separation.|Fresh
"""Roma"" is the cinematic equivalent of poetry, full of moments gentle and traumatizing, with a focus on people's lives that can feel precise and small and monumental all at the same time."|Fresh
Cuarón captures tiny moments in exceptional detail, finding the humor and tears in the everyday.|Fresh
Roma has wonderful performances that wring the emotions and great visual beauty. It's a slow-burning masterpiece that deserves to be seen on a big screen.|Fresh
[Alfonso Cuarón] has done almost archaeological work to paint rather than represent the experiences, the way of life. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Roma is in a league of its own in terms of sheer cinematic ambition and prowess, but as a drama it's not as deeply moving as some of this year's very best.|Fresh
Roma tackles political context, race, ethnicity, and social class and although it manages to slip into the ethnic menial labor trope through its character Cleo, it does present an artful depiction of the social underclass through visual metaphors.|Fresh
Filmed in glorious black and white, 'Roma' is another Alfonso Cuarón cinematic masterpiece.|Fresh
This is the kind of film that makes you look at the world differently; makes you see those things that felt previously inconsequential.|Fresh
"""Roma"" is a movie only in name. It's more an aural and visual experience that envelops your body before penetrating your soul."|Fresh
A pretty but unsatisfying arms-length experience.|Rotten
Alfonso Cuarón's new film is the rare family drama that's also a feast for the eyes.|Fresh
Roma's not cold, but it is calculating. You can almost feel Cuaron pulling your strings, a jealous deity happy to make you squirm in your seat while you beg for mercy.|Fresh
"The key to ""Roma"" is the patiently quiet and soulful performance by Aparicio."|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón completes the movie of the year in one of the most beautiful tours of the wound of time. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It is the clarity of Cuarón's eye, and the sea-like sway of his remembrance, that compel you to trust the tale he tells.|Fresh
Rome, in fuction to Mexico, is timeless. It happens in the seventies, but it's also happening out there, right now. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The way Cuarón accumulates details-the jumble of clothes drying on a roof, a broken jug after a New Year's toast, the ubiquity of the Jesus Christ Superstar soundtrack in 1971-builds an elemental power.|Fresh
Ambitiously gorgeous and deeply personal, Roma is one of the best films of the year and deserves your full, undivided attention.|Fresh
Art-house aficionados and most critics will fall prey, like me, to the mesmerizing and apparently haunting look and feel of the production that has yet to leave my memory. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Nudity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
Alongside fascinating social observations and surprising outbreaks of humour, Roma features one or two of the most heart-wrenching scenes in recent cinema.|Fresh
A milestone of a movie, an epic, an event ... It is a film of constant compassion and absolute humanity. It is totally, essentially personal to Cuarón, but it is also fundamentally universal. It is filmmaking of the highest order.|Fresh
With virtuoso visual and sonic expression, Roma is a symphonic masterpiece that is sure to marvel for decades to come.|Fresh
This is a film that alternatively shows humanity in all its ugly glory as well is its quiet moments of beauty.|Fresh
Immerse yourself in this beautiful memoir of growing up in early 1970s Mexico City from Academy Award winner Alfonso Cuaron shot in widescreen black-and-white. Yalitza Aparicio is glorious.|Fresh
Nothing much happens, yet there is so much to watch.|Fresh
"The term ""masterpiece"" gets chucked around far too loosely, and I mostly try to avoid it. But once in a lucky blue moon, there really are no other words to do a film justice."|Fresh
[I]t is admirable that Cuarón has chosen to see this familial and social change and violence from Cleo's perspective and through her experience.|Fresh
In its calm compassion, it's the antithesis of cynicism.|Fresh
From a visual and technical standpoint, it contains moments in which all of the elements of cinema come together with such precision that it puts most of the big ticket spectacles of recent years to shame.|Fresh
A rapturous memory-piece, gorgeously shot and hypnotically paced...best experienced on the big screen, where its visual splendor and emotional resonance can be fully appreciated.|Fresh
After a while the self-conscious virtuosity becomes overbearing. It feels like taking an aircraft carrier to go around the corner to CVS.|Fresh
In the end, the film belongs to Aparicio, whose unmannered performance gives Roma an extra dimension of poetic realism.|Fresh
"""Roma"" achieves the rare feat of making the personal authentically political, not through explicit polemic or tortured metaphors, but simply by observing life with enough perspective to reflect it in all its contradictions."|Fresh
Oh, how gentle, wide, wise, and true this movie is!|Fresh
brings empathy and joie de vivre that is impossible to experience in the disposable world of the streaming age.|Fresh
The beauty of this achievement is undeniable.|Fresh
Cuarón's artistry yields a film with the pinpoint authenticity of a docudrama, but also the intoxicating and lyrical poetry of memories as filtered through a perfect dream.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón's masterpiece oscillates between the intimacy of the director's Y Tu Mamá También and the grandeur of a Cecil B. Demille epic. It's an exquisite work of art filled with compassion and beauty|Fresh
Be thankful Roma exists. It's a special masterpiece, from a special, masterful filmmaker.|Fresh
A moving and empathetic glimpse at the mundanity and innate intimacy of domesticity.|Fresh
...suggests that in everyday domestic chores, strange and beautiful miracles are being performed.|Fresh
More than anything, it is proof of Cuarón's mastery as a cinematic storyteller.|Fresh
Everyday, unpretentious, beautiful in its harshness, raw in its calmness, Rome is pure truth, it is cinema in capital letters. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Roma is the sort of movie that successful pop filmmakers say they'd like to use their clout to make but almost never do.|Fresh
Cuarón's wonderful eye is not limited to his formal decisions with the camera and photography, but also in the intelligence of putting a new actress at the forefront. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"Shot in black and white, starring a nonprofessional actress, and set in a time and place seldom explored in mainstream cinema, ""Roma"" tells a deeply humane, enchanting story that easily ranks among the best and most indelible of 2018."|Fresh
"Few films this year impacted me more than ""Roma."""|Fresh
Every moment, every character is impeccably realised on-screen using skilful cinematography (by Cuaron himself), delightful production design and clever effects that recreate the period.|Fresh
What's become abundantly clear, over the course of this extraordinary run of searing films, is the degree to which Cuarón roots dramatic power in empathy and humanity.|Fresh
Dogs everywhere. Human cannonballs... The occasional earthquake. A street massacre... There is blood and birth and gunfire and the eternal pull of the ocean itself, the great, sweeping, amniotic yet deadly sea.|Fresh
I can tell, Cuaron has directed a masterpiece, not just an intimate epic - an epic about intimacy.|Fresh
Cuarón has successfully captured a sense of time and place resulting in a film that is as gorgeous as it is poignant, making it a cinematic experience not to be missed.|Fresh
Viscerally and emotionally, this cinematic exercise of harrowing gratitude is a transcendent experience.|Fresh
"Cuarón has made a roster of impressive films...but ""Roma,"" though perhaps not as immediately accessible, is his masterwork, a heartfelt evocation of a time and place that celebrates the unsung and the unheard."|Fresh
If you thought space would be Alfonso Cuarón's crowning achievement in terms of visual and auditory flair, think again; Roma is unforgettable and mesmerizing; bring the Kleenex|Fresh
Although it's quietly domestic in focus, Roma carries the heft Cuarón has gained in his Hollywood years, and wears it well.|Fresh
A bravura evocation of time and place, as richly detailed as the artfully designed worlds of Children of Men or A Little Princess.|Fresh
A rare sense of transcending time and space is apparent while watching director Alfonso Cuarón's autobiographical drama Roma. It is arguably his most mature and delicate work to date.|Fresh
Roma is not so much a memory piece but a corrective to memory. It will become more harrowing before it ends, but love will triumph in an ocean ending that's more oceanic than anything I've experienced in the movies, and maybe in life itself.|Fresh
There is a richness to Roma that will likely take multiple viewings to absorb.|Fresh
Roma will be tough to beat as the best film of 2018.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuaron's poignant, neo-realist masterpiece that's best viewed in theaters.|Fresh
Cuaron is an auteur in his own right, and as such puts his stamp on his own life's story. But in doing so, he never picks the stamp up, too often letting shots linger far longer than they are interesting.|Rotten
Roma is an unequivocally perfect film by every possible metric.|Fresh
An intriguing study in human dynamics and an exploration of how important certain people are who come into our lives during a formative time.|Fresh
Rome is a tribute to female solidarity. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's among the best work from one of the best filmmakers in the world.|Fresh
For those patient enough to allow Cuaron tell his family story will also see a story of love and heroism.|Fresh
Roma doesn't seek to present a rosy solution, nor does it pass judgement. It's concerned with the details, the small things that make up a life and make it meaningful. Everyone matters in Roma - but especially those who so often get overlooked.|Fresh
Nothing happens that doesn't happen every day and everywhere across the world, or across its higher realms of social injustice and inequality. But the story seems special because the director's gaze is special.|Fresh
Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón's Roma is a childhood memory film, both beautiful to look at and intriguing to contemplate.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón has made a truly inspiring, heartening and utterly devastating film. An absolute masterpiece.|Fresh
Cuaron is holding on to the memory of what such a time felt like in a Latin America of death squads.|Fresh
The film is reminiscent of Italian neorealism, yet Cuarón's shimmering black and white deep focus camerawork sets it apart...like having someone else's memories transferred into your brain, so acute is the sensation of nostalgia...|Fresh
A rare kind of masterpiece from director Alfonso Cuarón.|Fresh
It's clear how much Cuarón, who also wrote the script, cares for these people, and his passion and empathy immediately become infectious.|Fresh
Cuarón's compositions... are works of art in movement. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The same techniques with which Cuaron made Gravity and Children of Men immersive experiences work for Roma's more intimate drama.|Fresh
Cuarón has made his most personal film and his most universal, a modern masterpiece.|Fresh
"""Roma"" had wrapped me in its spell that completely, it would be hard to imagine a more artful arthouse attraction."|Fresh
Cuarón brings in eastern philosophy, mysticism, reflected planes, dog poo, an unusual amount of water and other confounding and wondrous things. It is vibrant, compassionate and profound but to describe it seems wrong, it must be experienced.|Fresh
'Roma' literally took my breath away. It is a masterwork by one of the world's most versatile filmmakers, and will be justifiably praised as the best film of 2018.|Fresh
Cuarón has explored the stylistic routes of realism and Roma extends the search. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A textured, richly-detailed dream; a sympathetic memory of maternal grace that's anything but the placid surface it presents.|Fresh
A poetic, crystalline visual glory, demonstrating Cuaron's graceful, effortless, yet complete command over light, space, and rhythm. It recalls films like 'Sunrise' and 'The Night of the Hunter...' But thematically, it's all Cuaron's.|Fresh
The focus is almost always on Cleo... At its best, this film makes you feel as if you could watch her go about her life forever and never tire of its simple, sorrowful dignity.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón's Roma opens with a magic trick... Ta da. You could do it at home, if you wanted. The rest of Roma, I'm not so sure.|Fresh
Roma is arguably the most ambitious and thrilling movie of the year - maybe of the decade, or at least since Cuarón last made a movie, 2013's Gravity.|Fresh
Cuarón depicts these small moments with cinematic virtuosity, filming in rich black and white -- the director did his own cinematography -- with long continuous takes.|Fresh
...the greatest film Alfonso Cuarón has made.|Fresh
An exhilarating masterpiece, Roma is at once quintessentially Mexican and profoundly universal.|Fresh
"To see ""Roma"" is to be in awe of Cuaron's gifts and to wonder how he does what he does."|Fresh
It's as close to cinematic poetry as you can get and director Alfonso Cuarón, with an expert-level attention to detail, places us at the center of his story - watching, listening, waiting, and cherishing every delicate moment.|Fresh
Just put the phone away, and allow yourself to submit to the serene, transcendent experience that is Roma.|Fresh
This is cinema that breathes with life and all its losses and discoveries. It is as enrapturing as a good story, and when it's over you think about it in the way you remember a dream.|Fresh
A mesmerizing, monochromatic epic that has to be experienced on the big screen.|Fresh
Pairing thrilling technical prowess with profound artistic vision, Alfonso Cuarón has made a masterpiece, at once understated and otherworldly. We need more filmmakers like him.|Fresh
One of the best things a movie can do is force us to settle down, quiet ourselves, and live inside someone else's experience for a while. And Roma is a shining example of a film that succeeds in that endeavor.|Fresh
It's an expansive, emotional portrait of life buffeted by violent forces, and a masterpiece.|Fresh
Like any art at its greatest, Alfonso Cuaron's autobiographical drama lets us see things we have seen before in a way we may never have seen them before.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón's Roma is determined to make us see. To really see.|Fresh
A gorgeous love letter to an alternately cloistered and turbulent childhood.|Fresh
You rarely see such an intimate tale painted on such a large canvas.|Fresh
Echoing in some ways the classics of Italian neo-realism, especially in its use of black and white, it is an epic of everydayness, as polished a personal film as you are likely to see.|Fresh
Cuarón has composed some of the most stunning shots and sequences in film history, and it would be a sin not to see this on the big screen, if possible.|Fresh
Cuarón has done more than break through walls of language, culture and class to craft the best movie of the year. No matter how you see or stream Roma, this game-changer is making its own kind of history.|Fresh
The result is a little too rose-tinted an homage, but Roma is still an exceptionally moving story, as well as another technical feat from Cuarón.|Fresh
Roma's sound design is so amazing from the very moment that the film begins to appear on screen.|Fresh
Roma is hypnotic and transporting and sublime, everything a movie seen on the big screen ought to be.|Fresh
Having only watched Roma once, I'm not quite ready to declare it an all-out masterpiece, but it is a powerful, emotionally resonant work of cinema.|Fresh
Yet another impressive technical accomplishment for Cuarón, Roma explores the filmmaker's memories of childhood in a truly immersive and vivid manner.|Fresh
Though often too wrapped up in memory to confront the hard questions, Cuaron's passion shines through in Roma to create a feature that's splendidly arranged.|Fresh
Roma is achingly beautiful. What begins as subtle and nuanced, evolves into heartbreaking resolve. Alfonso Cuarón delivers another cinema masterpiece.|Fresh
Arty and beautiful, but a bit like sitting on a sofa with Cuaron as he leafs through family photo albums.|Fresh
"A breathtaking travelogue through the profundity of memories, ""Roma"" exhales the magic and empathy inherent in the very best which film has to offer."|Fresh
The brilliant film chronicles a middle-class family in the 1970s.|Fresh
This is perhaps the major cinema experience of the year so far.|Fresh
It's undoubtedly one of the greatest movies of 2018, destined to live on as a highlight of Cuarón's career.|Fresh
If you appreciate the exquisite, melancholy beauty of the lives that bookend Roma-that bookend our collective stories-you will never forget this film|Fresh
Alfonso Cuaron delivers his best film since Children of Men.|Fresh
Roma is about memory, not fragmented and venerated, but realized with all its imperfections. As well as being an essential viewing experience, this is probably Cuarón's greatest film to date.|Fresh
Of those [films] I managed to see, none could match the clarity of vision and intensity of feeling, expansiveness and intimacy, breadth and breath of Alfonso Cuarón's Roma.|Fresh
Roma does not disappoint. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
The film is exquisite. It is a masterpiece and we will be talking about its artistry for years to come. My one recommendation this gift from Cuaron on the big screen.|Fresh
This is a profoundly cinematic film, astonishingly beautiful, with one memorable shot or sequence after another.|Fresh
I look forward to returning to Roma once more, as I'm positive I'll find even more to appreciate. I only regret that my second viewing won't take place in a theater, where the towering images and visceral sounds fully mesmerize the senses.|Fresh
Plenty of movies are personal and don't come close to the feeling we get fromRoma, that we are literally walking through Cuaron's fondest memories.|Fresh
The harrowing-at-one-moment and pastoral-the-next artistry may be compelling all on its own, but it's the weighty emotional heft of this film that shatters with resounding empathy to celebrate the resilience of special women.|Fresh
Breathtaking, commanding, thought-provoking, epic and powerful, Roma is both a potent, cinematic and anti-cinematic ode to life and family that demands repeat viewing. A strong contender for film of the year.See it on as big a screen as/if possible.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuarón's Roma is one of the films of the year, brilliantly observed and with an intense sense of yearning, lyricism and emotional truthfulness running through its every frame.|Fresh
A stunning achievement of cinema and not only the best film Netflix has released, but it is Cuarón's crowning achievement.|Fresh
Rarely do we critics allow ourselves to call a film a work of art, but that's the only turn of phrase for something as unforgettable and astounding as Roma. A cinematic masterpiece. Period.|Fresh
Though there is a dramatic story arc, both for the family and for Cleo, Roma functions most superbly as deeply human vignettes of everyday life.|Fresh
Yalitza Aparicio is the prophecy that the cinematic Gods spoke of, and the one we've waited for decades.|Fresh
Roma is a film that relegates politics to its proper place. Cuarón's women understand that what matters most is what happens in your family, not this week's march in the streets. It's a useful insight, maybe now more than ever.|Fresh
Roma is, overall, a quiet film, stable and calmly alert even when the volatility onscreen goes, within minutes, from zero to 100.|Fresh
High drama is handled by the characters with equanimity, as Cuarón creates glorious, complex images that may, without context, sound precious, but in the film play as realistic details.|Fresh
Stunning in black and white, the film contemplates the ways in which Cleo's bond with her employers can seem almost familial and the ways in which it emphatically isn't. She is both never alone and always alone.|Fresh
Rome is complicated, emotional, [with] entertaining moments, perfect technique, but above all, is beautiful. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
this is a film all about memories and is told through beautiful black and white visuals and precise grounded storytelling.|Fresh
What is the best way to see writer/director Alfonso Cuarón's reportedly semi-autobiographical ROMA? Definitely on the big screen, for which this gleamingly beautiful-looking film was exclusively designed.|Fresh
I was hypnotized and drawn in by the skill and heart of everyone involved.|Fresh
A great movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Nothing sounds forced in the director's exquisite description of that world of yesterday, everything sounds true, his formidable visual language serves to express feelings and feelings with complexity. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Roma feels grandiose, but it stays grounded in a powerful and personal story that pulls all the right strings at the right moments to make you feel like you've known this family your whole life.|Fresh
Aparicio provides color in the smallest, yet most tantalizing spectrum. She provides the hues that are rarely valued but should be taken for silver and gold. She provides the pallet of the everyday.|Fresh
A moving, ravishing, heartbreaking ode to the Mexico... This is a film so sincere and beautiful that, ideally, it deserves to be seen on the cinema screen. How about that, Netflix?|Fresh
"Social unrest can be felt all around the film's 135 minutes, and there are scenes that stay etched in your memory; that is what ""Roma"" is about, memory. It's not necessarily driven by plot as much as by these immaculately detailed moments."|Fresh
Cuaron builds the symbol of a country that has killed their own future, a country that gives a face to the outside when inside, others tirelessly wash the blood spilled or avoid, there, the tragedy of the middle class. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Roma is autobiography as autocritique, and in exploring a point of view adjacent to his own, Cuarón appears to have rediscovered his identity as a filmmaker.|Fresh
There's hardly a frame in Roma that doesn't make you sit up and take notice. No matter how mundane the action on the screen is, Alfonso Cuarón turns it into something reverential.|Fresh
... evinces a hyperrealism achieved not through visceral technique that interprets verisimilitude as hectic impressionism, but rather as the extreme density of historical and social observation of everyday things made monumental...|Fresh
Shot in arresting black and white and gorgeously crafted, the film is marred by a very slow, meandering Act I that barely holds attention.Then Act II launches into a melodramatic plotline that becomes engaging.|Fresh
It is the unique aspects of Rome, and not the invariables, that illuminate something about reality for which the sun has been insufficient. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Roma is a slow but steady immersion that, for the most patient and least distracted viewer, will sweep you away in a vision that turns mid-20th century domesticity into a 70mm epic.|Fresh
Roma is hardly plot focused; it is almost entirely driven by emotion. This is clearly a passion project for Cuarón, and the result is a deeply moving melodrama about the quiet personal tragedies that unfold behind closed doors.|Fresh
An absolute classic. Will be taught in film schools someday.|Fresh
[Roma is] a majestic feat of filmmaking, an intimate portrait of a family that also serves as a broad portrait of a changing nation. Cuaron creates such a vibrant world that it demands to be seen on the biggest canvas possible.|Fresh
Throughout the film, Cuarón's cinematography and editing tells a story of isolation and subordination-women and men framed and shot separately.|Fresh
Roma represents a certain kind of cinematic peak, where on both production and story grounds we're treated to something that nears perfection the way that only the truly great works do.|Fresh
Brilliantly conceived, beautifully acted, politically aware, and profoundly true-especially about the labyrinthine emotional relationship between domestic workers and their masters.|Fresh
When looking to the past of history books or our own memories, individuals can recede into the fabric. Roma refocuses our attention...|Fresh
Executed to near perfection, this movie serves as a nostalgic time capsule of Mexico in the early '70s. Every performance is alive and intriguing.|Fresh
By capturing and exploring Cleo's individual life with such vision and thoughtfulness, he has managed to piece together a sweeping interpretation of life itself.|Fresh
Thoroughly absorbing and gently touching, ROMA opens a window into the past and has the feel of an Italian neorealist classic.|Fresh
A masterful achievement in filmmaking as an empathy machine, a way for us to spend time in a place, in an era, and with characters we never would otherwise.|Fresh
This is a masterpiece.|Fresh
Cuarón's attention to detail is sublime.|Fresh
The film will deservedly receive attention for its autobiographical examination of social hierarchy, but the artistry is simply lacking...|Fresh
In its deceptive simplicity and indisputable beauty, the picture presents a strong refutation of policies designed to stoke xenophobia. It's an empathy machine.|Fresh
"""Roma"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the most moving. If Norma Desmond had been able to see it she wouldn't have worried about the pictures getting small."|Fresh
Roma is something special.|Fresh
Cuarón impeccably links the personal and the political into dense scenes that reproduce the sudden yet inexorable nature of trauma; through his use of plans-séquence, he interweaves the individual and the collective, the private and the public.|Fresh
Cuarón's masterful artistry is what makes Roma personal, unique, and more visually striking than any film you've seen in quite some time.|Fresh
Roma may only span a year or so, but somehow in that year is the entirety of life itself - its small, fleeting moments of joy and longer, more poignant stretches of heartbreak.|Fresh
A richly textured masterpiece, Roma is cinema at its purest and most human.|Fresh
Roma also makes the case that a great director possibly becomes greater if he serves as his own cinematographer. Cuarón shoots in gorgeous black and white - it was a privilege to watch this film on a big screen.|Fresh
Astoundingly, this is Aparicio's acting debut. It is a stoic, studied performance that at times pushes into realms of intense physical and emotional endurance that result in some of the film's most devastating scenes.|Fresh
So full of dazzlingly intricate visual poetry, so teeming with sensory spirit, that trying to review it is a bit like trying to review all of life. Which may sound a bit grandiose, but Cuarón's magnum opus provokes such turgid sentiment.|Fresh
It's fitting that Cuarón is also the cinematographer here, as Roma is a deeply personal handsome vision. Cuarón is a master at visual storytelling, pointing to a small change in the frame that will be important later on.|Fresh
Cuarón shoots in a generous widescreen that seems to take in all the sights, sounds and even smells of barrio life.|Fresh
Roma is a return to more earthly delights for Cuarón but no less effort has been made by the filmmaker (nor less practical wizardry employed) to offer the viewer a sensory experience of the characters' lives.|Fresh
Too often Roma feels dramatically insipid (the family is actually profoundly boring) and unsure of what it's trying to say about Cleo's life and her status - if it's saying anything at all.|Rotten
Having seemingly mastered the Hollywood blockbuster, Cuarón appears to be setting his sights on a more intimate kind of filmmaking along the lines of the cinema's great humanists, like Yasujiro Ozu or Lucretia Martel.|Fresh
[Cuarón's] extraordinary and expansive new film, Roma, is on an altogether higher plateau - a transcendent picture album of snatched (albeit hauntingly vivid) memories which dances to its own, off-kilter tune.|Fresh
[Cuarón] tables the showiness of Children of Men and Gravity in favor of ongoing restraint, creating a fresh kind of intimacy.|Fresh
It was shot... in high-resolution wide-format 65mm black and white film, the camera movements gentle, revealing all to us, both in detail and scope, with an extraordinary effect of yearning and tenderness: instantly eidetic.|Fresh
Cuarón never seeks a tidy resolution for their loving, lopsided, complicated relationship. But it's one of the reasons why Roma leaves such a deep and lasting impression.|Fresh
Roma follows in the tradition of neorealist filmmakers like Vittorio De Sica and Satyajit Ray. No one else is making movies like this today.|Fresh
Cuarón has written a love letter to all the women around the world who have devoted their lives to caring for the children of the families they work for.|Fresh
Roma is made of the stuff of memory, and is the kind of film you don't forget.|Fresh
At the heart of it all is a wonderful performance from Aparicio, who brings to the role something gentle, delicate, stoic and selfless. She is the jewel of this outstanding film.|Fresh
Alfonso Cuaron's Roma is an immensely moving film made by one person, for one person and it is our privilege, and almost a little bit our intrusion, to be allowed in.|Fresh
An immersive bath in some of the most luxuriantly beautiful black-and-white images you've ever seen, this is the work of a great filmmaker who exhibits absolute control and confidence in what he's doing.|Fresh
"""Roma"" is gorgeously done, yet you may feel gently absorbed in it more than than you're deeply moved by it."|Fresh
It works both as a personal statement and a larger philosophical humanist love letter to life itself.|Fresh
