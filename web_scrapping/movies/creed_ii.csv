It might be full of contradictions, but Creed II is passionate and confident enough to win you over anyway.|Fresh
Completely predictable; full of stand-up-and-cheer moments, as well as references to previous films of the saga. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Hits hard with the punches and emotions, successfully closing the chapter on one story while building upon another in this expansion of the Rocky saga.|Fresh
"I was really hoping this would be the movie where he leaves the ""Rocky nest"" and spreads his wings and fly, but I suppose we'd have to wait and see in another potential sequel."|Fresh
The director integrates every iconic element... For fans of the saga, it's the perfect film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Good thing Creed II is very aware of what audiences came here for, because the movie not only delivers, it makes its cliches feel like they matter.|Fresh
Heft and depth go far in this eighth franchise instalment. In the ring and on the screen, you can't connect without both.|Fresh
The story enraptures you with its simplicity. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
There is an accumulation of melodramatic components that weaken the effect of the style. [Full Review in Spanish]|Rotten
Creed II spins a beautiful, engaging yarn about a damaged egotist that held me rapt despite myself.|Fresh
One of the most pleasant surprises of the film is the work of Dolph Lundgren and Florian Munteanu as Ivan and Viktor Drago, respectively. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh

An appropriate continuation of the Creed legacy|Fresh
"""It works like a good entry in the Rocky saga""."|Fresh
Thanks to the commitment of the returning cast, the sincere faithfulness to the franchise, its blunt-force dramatic approach and the intense boxing scenes, Creed 2 is a great sequel that's worth running out to watch.|Fresh
It's not particularly innovative, but it has a narrative built with pure rigor, nobility and perseverance. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Creed II commits almost the same mistakes as Rocky II. Repeat, reiterate schemes, and the fights have neither the spectacle nor the composition that director Ryan Coogler... had achieved in Creed (2015). [Full review in Spanish]|Rotten
The film has a great ability to alternate a theme with another montage, evading the lower jabs that could make one feel more tragic. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
If Creed II ends up being the definitive end for these characters, it would be the most emotional and captivating film. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
A step down in many ways from its predecessor, Creed II  is still a solid and worthy sequel.|Fresh
the film explores well enough how much of the past shapes who we become, and with Jordan, Thompson, and Stallone, it creates an endearing onscreen family.|Fresh
Close to an XL for me. It's a sequel that uses a rehash of storylines and characters that still actually held up.|Fresh
This movie could have easily fallen apart, but even with Stallone contributing to the writing, Steven Caple Jr. hit a home run with this.|Fresh
An emotional rematch - although a bit worn - in which the combat keeps you at the edge of your seat. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
Creed II is neither as assured nor as rousing as its predecessor, but it has a secret weapon up its boxing gloves, and that is to embrace the daftest elements of the series while simultaneously finding the heart that drives every good Rocky film.|Fresh
A blandly predictable sports movie given some kind of disreputable interest by inserting itself into the mythology of an iconic, if not particularly high-quality franchise.|Rotten
The weakest of all the Rocky/Creed movies...|Rotten
Enjoyable in fits and starts.|Fresh
It uses a well-worn formula to create a fresh, invigorating experience.|Fresh
Lacks some of the (sorry) punch of its predecessor but Creed II still shines on the strength of Michael B. Jordan.|Fresh
What plays on screen is a caricature of the franchise, a film so loathe to have its own identity that it forgets everything that made previous installments must-see cinema.|Rotten
Creed 2 uppercuts you right in the feels.|Fresh
The film is hard to dislike because of the two strong performances from its leading men.|Fresh
CREED II find a legacy through making mistakes. It's messy, and we don't always bring out the best parts of ourselves. The trick is to breathe, listen, open up.|Fresh
Playing like the greatest hits of every Rocky sequel to date, Creed II is bigger and its hits thud harder, but it misses the emotional focus and finesse of its predecessor.|Fresh
The boxing sequences are brutal, no matter how much people want to turn boxing into a metaphor for inner growth and building character. The message is that family matters above all.|Fresh
What ensues is enjoyably rooted in sentiment, genre stereotype and Rocky mythology, but does drag a little between the brutal but brilliantly staged fight scenes.|Fresh
Feeling to have less energy than the preceding film, it's still an enjoyable and competently made follow-up ... and a fitting swan-song for the character of Rocky Balboa.|Fresh
It's a letdown for a good movie that had all the makings of greatness, but, ultimately, is let down by an overly predictable narrative.|Fresh
The dramatic pull of Adonis fighting the son of his father's killer is obvious but riveting all the same, made even more engrossing by the shadow of Rocky Balboa.|Fresh
It's just another Rocky sequel, and that sucks.|Rotten
It is strange to say this, but the thing that carries the biggest sting here - especially in the scenes when Stallone's Rocky, aware that he is in his life's twilight, muses about roads not taken - is not the boxing, but the bonding.|Fresh
This follow-up isn't as good as the original, but it has enough fight left in it to go the distance and end up winning over the scoring judges. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)|Fresh
But despite its own individual merits, this year's sequel, Creed II, fails to quite live up to the potential of its predecessor, and Coogler himself seems to be the essential missing ingredient.|Rotten
The chemistry between the cast members - whether it's between Stallone and Jordan or Thompson and Jordan - makes the film all the more believable.|Fresh
There's... so much to enjoy in Creed II.|Fresh
Gripping and poignant, Creed II marks the humble passing of the mantle. Just need Mr. T's son for next time.|Fresh
Creed II does beat you over the head with its sentimentalism - too much text instead of subtext. But it's generally effective,|Fresh
...the same thumping and grinding sports movie clich√©s and oodles of heavy-duty macho soul-baring.|Rotten
This sequel answers the bell and then some, giving us something that, while not quite a bout for the ages, turns out to be a hell of a fight.|Fresh
The fight choreography is on point and the sound editing of punches makes it feel like you are the one who has been hit.|Fresh
The film never quite finds a consistent tone but it never stops being entertaining either.|Fresh
A solid film that pulls you in in the way these films do, but if you come in knowing that, you let the path take you.|Fresh
Ultimately though, Creed II is as much a male weepie or old-school melodrama as it is a boxing movie, and this is actually where it succeeds best.|Fresh
If this is indeed Rocky's last time ringside, it's a solid if predictable farewell to one of American cinema's most enduring characters.|Fresh
While Creed II does not reach the fantastic heights of Creed, it still puts up plenty of fight to prove itself worthy.|Fresh
... refreshingly less concerned with trite triumphs than it is with fractured men forced to confront who they perceive themselves to be or aspire to be vs. who they are - and the fight to reconcile that.|Fresh
Of course Creed II is familiar ground. But it honours the genre and still has enough vitality to make us feel the thrill again.|Fresh
New director Steven Caple Jr (Emmett Till) keeps the film at a simmer in between the bouts and his cast are uniformly terrific.|Fresh
The fact that Creed II is so predictable takes nothing away from the excitement. The scenes in the ring are superbly shot and slickly edited, the thud of each blow enough to send you reeling back into the cinema seat.|Fresh
Steven Caple Jr's film is watchable enough if you're a fan of its traditions, but Jordan is too sleek and handsome for his suffering to be as glorious as Sylvester Stallone's agonies in days gone by.|Rotten
Just as Adonis Creed is a worthy of the Apollo Creed legacy, Creed II is another deserving addition to the Rocky canon.|Fresh
It's an effective sequel to two very different movies grown from the same cinematic DNA.|Fresh
There are a lot of great things about CREED II. It's a meditation on the fathers that never showed up, those too lost in their own success to truly be present, those too deep in their own shame to provide comfort. It is not exactly new but still well done|Fresh
Creed II is almost a match for its predecessor in most respects, and in one its superior.|Fresh
"Jordan is the best thing about the film; vulnerable mouth and defiant, boyish attitude voice (""I'm dangerous!"" he insists, voice cracking) telegraphing insecurity and impostor syndrome that feels lived in."|Fresh
Doesn't hit the heights of its predecessor, but it's still an effective, hard-hitting story that honours what came before and allows Jordan the chance to shine again.|Fresh
Director Steven Caple Jr. takes over from Ryan Coogler to deliver a worthy follow-up that lands heavy blows where it counts and in a few places that are unexpected.|Fresh
There are those for whom Rocky IV is the preferred chapter in the original series. Creed II is a gift to us.|Fresh
You can feel the punches being landed... because you care about the characters.|Fresh
A pensive, tough-minded, extremely well-directed drama that refuses to take easy options or cop outs.|Fresh
The film is slickly shot. And the fight scenes are nicely choreographed. You feel the pain of the boxers as they slug it out.|Fresh
More than anything, it deserves kudos for managing to make Rocky IV relevant and impactful again, rather than just using it to take easy pot shots at Cold War jingoism.|Fresh
[Director Steven Caple Jr.] acquits himself well and delivers the formula with confidence. But the sequel can't deliver the same energetic freshness of Creed.|Fresh
Perfectly serviceable as both a boxing movie and a Rocky movie, but it's missing that extra gear that the first Creed had (Philadelphia Weekly)|Fresh
In spite of the clumsy storyline and more pedestrian approach overall, the shock of Creed II is that it all still works so well.|Fresh
I don't think I have sat before a boxing film where the punches felt harder, even 10 rows back from the screen.|Fresh
As the eighth instalment in an ancient boxing franchise, Creed II should not be this good. Yet at times it is flat-out thrilling.|Fresh
[Creed II] holds fast to the Rocky traditions and, though rather predictable, is utterly irresistible from the start.|Fresh
Can't quite manage to continue the first film's smart, unsentimental examination of male emotion and men's relationships. At best achieves a draw with a genre path that is already extremely well worn.|Fresh
Hugely enjoyable, with some terrific performances and a keen eye on the continuing evolution of the series, while maintaining the heart of the original.|Fresh
If Creed was almost as good as Rocky, Creed II is almost as good as Creed.|Fresh
Far from the knock-out punch of the first film,Creed II still makes an impact.|Fresh
I bloody LOVED it. It hit every beat, tugged every string and left me feeling 12 again.|Fresh
The fight scenes are decent, Stallone's still appealing, and when Bill Conti's original theme kicks in, it's impossible to resist. But please, no more.|Fresh
When a film is as unashamedly formulaic as Creed II, the formula had better be a good one. Fortunately, it is.|Fresh
Settle in for an exceedingly average story, a total lack of thrills, and far too little of Sylvester Stallone.|Rotten
The movie does offer one genuine surprise: the Drago family drama actually eclipses anything going on with the Creeds or Balboas.|Rotten
Creed II ramps up the nostalgia in a story that's as much a family drama as a boxing movie.|Fresh
Sadly, the first Creed's director, Ryan Coogler, didn't stick around for a sequel and it shows. But this is still a solid, earnestly acted effort.|Fresh
The Rocky franchise is nothing if not redundant, or rather, full of reverberations, past stories just waiting to be mined by some later sequel. Creed II doesn't quite make a meal of the opportunity.|Rotten
How do you top a film that managed to reignite a seemingly extinct franchise? Going by Creed II, the answer is you can't, but you should sure as hell try.|Fresh
Whatever you think about Rocky IV, it is inarguably a mid-1980s time capsule. Creed II isn't a time capsule, but it should get buried.|Rotten
Creed II is by no means a bad film, but like the first sequel to the original 1976 Rocky it settles for a box-ticking template that seems reluctant to bring any tangible forward momentum to the franchise.|Fresh
It's a sturdy second round after a cracking first one.|Fresh
42 years since the original 'Rocky' and, even if he's taken a backseat for new blood, Stallone is the still the MVP of this franchise.|Fresh
Creed II, the sequel to 2015's excellent Creed and the eighth overall entry in the Rocky saga, lives up to the legend, which is saying something, because, well, did you read the first part of this sentence?|Fresh
You see it coming. The same goes for much of the dialogue. Even so, this is an enjoyable and rousing affair that wins you over by the sheer process of attrition.|Fresh
While Creed II isn't quite as fresh or fleet of foot as its predecessor, it still lands telling blows in all the right places, and ends with its arms held aloft in triumph.|Fresh
An entertaining next chapter that manages to both stand on its own and serve as fun nostalgia for one of the Rocky franchise's most iconic villains.|Fresh
Eight movies in, and you'd think there'd be some better, fleshed-out characters populating this universe.|Rotten
Cheerfully ludicrous.|Fresh
This movie, like some of the other movies in the Rocky series is about heart. In Rocky, the boxer's power comes from his heart, and from the people he loves. That theme is repeated here very effectively.|Fresh
Creed II misses a major opportunity to tell a great story about fathers and sons.|Rotten
If you were delivering a lecture on how to extract the most value from a worn formula then you could do worse than direct your audience to the latest film in the Rocky cycle.|Fresh
Totally satisfying sequel, packing a powerful wallop...|Fresh
Creed 2 doesn't pack as big of an emotional punch as its predecessor, but I just can't get enough of these characters. The Rocky nostalgia hasn't worn off yet, and this film proves that it won't any time soon.|Fresh
Sometimes, a sports movie is just a sports movie, and Creed II is an entertaining movie. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Though it lacks the knockout blow of Ryan Coogler's first, unable to live up to the genuine surprise of a great series spin-off, it's still an entertaining contender.|Fresh
The stakes are there, but what this movie did well was it made you sympathetic to the Drago family...There's more weight to it now.|Fresh
This episode in this extended tale of fighting men and the warrior creed demos father-son dynamics, and especially between Ivan and Viktor Drago -- forgiveness and compassion. These are the building blocks of nontoxic masculinity.|Fresh
This new entry plays things just above safe, being a crazy good crowd pleaser that is both level-headed and daring, but within set limits.|Fresh
Doesn't punch nearly as hard without Coogler in its corner.|Rotten
What saves it is Michael B. Jordon. Sure, the first thing you notice is the power, the arm cocked, ready to fire. But his real strength is his openness...the way he allows himself to be emotionally vulnerable.|Fresh
The way disability gets used as a plot device to further Adonis' narrative feels mishandled.|Fresh
Despite a predictable script and workmanlike execution behind the camera, the cast elevates the material with their performances to craft another entertaining entry into the Rocky saga|Fresh
Creed II is gonna to be a winner for any fan of the Rocky franchise, but it's also going to be a win you over if you're not. At its core, it's a family movie that asks some very deep questions...|Fresh
The ineffective emotional stakes, watered-down drama, and threadbare relational conflicts make Creed 2 exceedingly impersonal.|Rotten
This is a return to that punch-drunk Rocky movie vibe, with obvious heroes and villains and internal conflicts that are vivid but never go very deep.|Fresh
It's not entirely without its merits -- as much as seems rote, it's still a far cry from '80s-style cartoon buffoonery -- but just as quickly as Creed sprung up out of nowhere, this revised series already feels more than a little played out.|Rotten
Creed II is not nearly as rousing, heartbreaking, and life affirming as the original. However, on it's own terms, it's an enjoyable sequel that nimbly brings Adonis into the fold of the original films.|Fresh
Creed II, along with the entire Creed spinoff, has managed to be an incredible revival of a beloved franchise, a black movie that is proud of its blackness, and also a good romance.|Fresh
One of the overarching themes of Creed II is stepping out of the shadow of the greatness that came before you. This is a lesson the Creed franchise needs to learn. You can only get so much mileage using the Rocky films as a springboard.|Fresh
A spiritual sequel to Rocky IV released in the midst of a new Cold War and it turns out to be completely apolitical? What a disappointment.|Rotten
"Have the ""Creed"" movies learned nothing from the ""Rocky"" series? Sequels aren't always the answer."|Rotten
This flashy sequel is an entertaining entry that fits into the Rocky franchise like it's a part of the family.|Fresh
An entertaining and satisfying sequel that respects the past while it sets up its own future. Michael B. Jordan is a beast here. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
It's a step down from its predecessor, but hey, aren't we all? It works well enough as yet another Rocky sequel.|Fresh
More like a sequel to Rocky IV than to the superior Creed, but Stallone (who also co-wrote the script) and Michael B. Jordan know exactly how to deliver the goods so the audience will be happy with this.|Fresh
"Director Steven Caple Jr. (""The Land"") inherits the thankless task of following in the footsteps of talented ""Creed"" helmer Ryan Coogler, but no one could have rescued a ho-hum script credited to six writers, including Coogler and Stallone."|Rotten
This one is as bloated as an overweight boxer. The best reason to love anything from the Rocky series is Sylvester Stallone's Rocky & even Stallone isn't that likable here.|Rotten
Not only a superb follow-up to the breakout 2015 hit, but it's a worthy continuation of Rocky IV. There's not a lot of films that could so skillfully expand on two films.|Fresh
The actors are all on point, the storytelling through action is brutal, crisp and satisfying and whichever of the two credited screenwriters came up with Adonis' ring-entrance gimmick should get a special Oscar just for that note.|Fresh
CREED II is your best case scenario. It lives up to the original and also stands on its own two feet, boding well for CREED III, IV and beyond|Fresh
Surprisingly touching treatment of villains makes up for rote boxing action.|Fresh
It's a miracle that after eight films in the franchise, the formula can still pull the emotional punches regarding: fathers, redemption, loneliness, family - and somehow remain fresh.|Fresh
... its understanding of the franchise's history is evident and a significant contributor to creating a movie that long-time fans will enjoy.|Fresh
...visceral sports action and heart-squeezing emotional drama.|Fresh
If the results aren't as artful as those by Creed director Ryan Coogler (Steven Caple Jr. steps in), they still feel earned.|Fresh
"Where Caple's direction is truly mastered is in his active command of his actors, most notably Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson. Strap in, because ""Creed II"" is a wild, great time at the movies."|Fresh
Creed II should be seen as a highlight of the series, easily becoming one of the best sequels in franchise history... Jordan shines again and again.|Fresh
Under the less-inspired direction of Steven Caple Jr., Creed II feels like a compilation of greatest Rocky scenes climaxed by a final match so ludicrously cliched that viewers groaned during a Monday screening...|Rotten
Even though we've seen this movie before (and more than once), there's a strong beating heart to this franchise.|Fresh
Rocky movies are a genre within a genre, and their audiences expect or even demand they be 95 percent predictable. So when they're even ten percent surprising - a generous estimate of Creed II's novelty quotient - it feels like a win.|Fresh
For a film about fathers and sons, Creed II doesn't much evolve the portrait of fatherhood. ... [but it] has some relevant things to say about male fragility.|Fresh
Creed II is a really enjoyable film and takes its characters to such great places that I have no desire to see more.|Fresh
Creed II isn't as good as the first installment, but it's no disgrace, either. Credit the cast for keeping familiar characters alive -- if a little bruised.|Fresh
Finds a way to rehash without losing heart, also doing something compelling with a potentially ridiculous plot.|Fresh
From the ding of the first bell to the echo of the last, Creed II is ... a stirring drama that utilizes every inch of emotional real estate to enormous effect.|Fresh
It may struggle in the other departments, but Creed II is a really satisfying Rocky movie. It's just that I think I prefer the Creed movies now.|Fresh
Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone again provide a potent one-two combo, in a movie filled with nostalgic callbacks that make the most of the franchise's durable formula.|Fresh
Audiences have now invested decades in this ringside soap opera and they want to see where it goes, despite everything else. And, when all is said and done, the fight scenes are actually quite good.|Fresh
The fact it all works as well as it does is a testament to how rich the performances are as well as the kinetically captivating efficiency of Caple's direction.|Fresh
"The ""Rocky"" formula is good enough that these films could probably go on forever, but now that the Drago story is out of the way, Stallone should really pass the torch and give Adonis Creed a movie of his own."|Fresh
"If what you seek is a good ""Rocky"" movie then ""Creed II"" delivers the goods."|Fresh
One reason Creed II manages to avoid totally losing itself in Rocky lore is simple: It's still rooted in a movie that took its characters and their emotional complexities seriously.|Fresh
Despite repeating the same beats as most Rocky films, the film emulates the fighting spirit of Rocky Balboa and manages to triumph. [Full Review in Spanish]|Fresh
"""Creed II"" doesn't pack the same punch, either emotionally or in the ring, but as with seven ""Rocky"" movies before it, longtime fans will still be cheering by the end of this sequel."|Fresh
It's not quite ROCKY II, but then it's not ROCKY III, either.|Fresh
A generation later, the partial sequel, partial reboot of the great boxing franchise is falling neatly in line with its legacy.|Fresh
There is more pleasure in watching Rocky Balboa call the Philly DPW about a broken street light than in the film's climactic fight.|Rotten
The solid sequel I wanted Creed II to be.|Fresh
"The sequel isn't in the same lofty space as the first ""Creed,"" but it's a sure crowd-pleaser with some added emotional punch."|Fresh
"""Creed II"" goes the distance, but it lacks the knockout punch of its 2015 and 1985 predecessors."|Fresh
Gone are the little moments of humanity that punched us in the gut when the suspense of victory was absent. Gone are the pangs of loss, guilt, and regret with real consequences.|Rotten
For a film whose hero's purpose is to uppercut the expectations embroiled in his name, Creed II ironically and regrettably takes refuge in its franchise's beaten down, yet irresistibly feel-good formula.|Fresh
While the film falls short of delivering a knockout punch, Creed II is able to go the distance thanks to excellent boxing sequences and the return of Ivan Drago.|Fresh
Maybe a younger generation needs this update, but fans schooled in the franchise history will consider it all a retread, with only a new boxer at the film's center.|Rotten
Like the iconic Rocky statue itself, the film and its series are triumphant, immovable and gleaming in bronzed defiance.|Fresh
Almost single-handedly, Michael B. Jordan takes this film the distance. In gestures, attitude and a wide range of expressions, he makes Adonis far more complex than the film itself.|Fresh
The Rocky formula matters more than the characters in it.|Rotten
"If this year's soft reboot of ""Halloween"" bridged old and new fans to an iconic horror franchise, ""Creed II"" does the same for devotees of the ""Rocky"" series."|Fresh
Keep one's expectations low. If you can do that, then Creed II delivers well beyond them.|Fresh
You'll cheer, no doubt. Creed II still disappoints, especially in one critical reunion we didn't know we needed to see.|Fresh
"""Creed II"" is a respectable if not revelatory sequel to the sequel, even if it lacks its predecessor's grace and narrative texture."|Fresh
Creed II is a perfectly OK sequel. There's some comfort to be found in the predictability of its beats. But only at the end does it muster any real vitality.|Fresh
"At its best moments, ""Creed II"" manages a feat nearly as striking as anything that Michael B. Jordan's Rocky Balboa prot√©g√© pulls off in the boxing ring: It doesn't play all that much like a sequel."|Fresh
"Pretty much the movie everyone was afraid ""Creed"" was going to be."|Rotten
The story's progression is largely predictable, but the filmmakers handle it with seriousness and care, making time for character development on both sides of the monumental fight.|Fresh
It's always fun to decry a formulaic movie - except when the formula actually works.|Fresh
Caple doesn't always connect, but he does have Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan packing a one-two punch as Rocky Balboa and Adonis Creed.|Fresh
It feels more like 'Rocky VII' than 'Creed II,' recycling the old franchise tropes rather than reimagining them in the way its predecessor did.|Rotten
This surprisingly effective second chapter proves that Adonis Creed still has something left in the tank.|Fresh
Creed II lacks the panache of the original installment but has enough emotion and inspiration to find itself a perfect fit for the Rocky franchise|Fresh
These don't need to be directed by auteurs to succeed, and Cable delivers what he needs to without getting in the film's way.|Fresh
The whole of the film, directed by Steven Caple Jr., is a subtle progression away from the past.|Fresh
By playing things too safe, it loses the power and spontaneity that gave Creed its energy and drive.|Rotten
Admirably carries Adonis Creed and Rocky Balboa's stories forward while somehow managing to wring real stakes and real drama from the most comically over-the-top installment in the Rocky saga's entire four-decade arsenal.|Fresh
Creed 2 is the movie we were afraid the first, far superior Creed was going to be.|Rotten
The latest installment in the seemingly endless Rocky franchise offers nothing new but still may appeal to fans of the genre.|Rotten
Soaked in pugilistic blood, fervent sweat, and warranted tears, Creed II is comfortably ingrained big screen entertainment.|Fresh
Stallone's lovably tough Rocky is as solid as ever, and Jordan and Thompson make a ferocious couple.|Fresh
The fight scenes are appropriately intense and amazingly choreographed, and the performances are all solid, making it an overall enjoyable experience. Still, I wonder what it would have been like had if Creed II had a bit more heart.|Fresh
Creed 2 is a commendable chapter in the franchise, thriving from a strong commitment to character, mostly thanks to Stallone's reverence to his own legacy and the new one being created for Jordan.|Fresh
"Although ""Creed 2"" doesn't have the same rousing magic as the last chapter, it offers intriguing parallel plots of fathers and sons trying to find redemption after loss."|Fresh
So, sure, Creed II has elements of boxing to it, but the heart of the story is with these men dealing with the emotions of fatherhood, opening up, and owning their past mistakes to move on with their futures.|Fresh
"Merely adopting a formula is easy - that happens all too often. Investing in a formula, making it breathe - that's the challenge, and ""Creed II"" meets it."|Fresh
"""Creed II"" deftly pulls together threads from all of the ""Rocky"" movies, underscoring that it's time to acknowledge that Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa is one of the greatest of all Hollywood characters."|Fresh
Strong performances combined with the sturdy, albeit measured direction by Steven Caple Jr., manage to ensure that although Creed II often comes across as a guilty pleasure, there's no shame in enjoying it for nostalgic reasons.|Fresh
There is nothing wrong with Creed II other than the fact that it isn't Creed.|Fresh
Oh, so what if it isn't the knockout the original Creed was? This one still lands its punches, even if a little more softly.|Fresh
"""Creed II"" steps inside the ropes under the heavy weight of expectations, is not as nimble and has put on some pounds around the middle. Yet while the film doesn't get heads ringing like the first one, it's still able to go the distance."|Fresh
"""Creed II"" is a terrific movie, a boxing picture full of inspired sweetness and shrewd science that honors the cherished traditions of the genre while feeling like something new and exciting in the world."|Fresh
Creed II refuses to go toe-to-toe with anything vaguely political, essentially ignoring any and all of the headlines of the past two years in what can only be described as an exhausting display of political aloofness.|Fresh
Creed II is like spending time at McDonald's among friends. It's satisfying and warm, but not something you want to be doing all the time.|Fresh
...as a boxing movie, this is pretty solid, the equivalent of a song you've heard 100 times being covered by a new artist. But Creed felt like a new song; Creed II feels like a decent cover of that new song.|Fresh
The biggest problem with Creed II is that the 8th installment of the Rocky franchise...plays it safe.|Rotten
Thompson gives a performance just as sensitive and strong-willed as her last, and her chemistry with Jordan is even greater this time. Jordan continues to impress, navigating the emotional territory of the movie better than Stallone ever did.|Fresh
Sheer entertainment value covers up the scars from a recognizable story that has been beaten to a bloody pulp|Fresh
Creed II may not advance Adonis' story, but it's still a good Rocky film nonetheless.|Fresh
Wearying rehash|Rotten
Caple gives us well drawn characters we're invested in all while dealing with the clich√© boxing tropes with restraint and maintaining the gritty tone Coogler established in the original.|Fresh
Strong sequel has boxing violence, some language.|Fresh
Creed II has compelling drama hitting you from all sides.|Fresh
Dolph Lundgren in close-up, in various moods of granite determination and unexpected emotional thawing, qualifies as this sequel's most legit surprise.|Fresh
Go in expecting greatness, and you're likely to be disappointed. Go in expecting a Rocky sequel, and you'll get a surprisingly effective one.|Fresh
Creed II does have a pulse, even if you know almost everything that's going to happen a couple of breaths before it does.|Fresh
Creed II falls victim to the sins of sequelitis-it's bigger, louder and more grandiose than its predecessor-yet manages to right itself by not losing focus on the humanity of its central characters.|Fresh
A surprise-free movie can be a satisfying one, if the grace notes are played with care. They are in Creed II.|Fresh
Creed II is a testament to Stallone's ability to re-write this same movie over and over again and make it work endlessly for audiences old and new.|Fresh
Rocky and Adonis are back for a return match and a solid sequel.|Fresh
What easily could have tarnished what's come before instead movingly builds on it. This is one of the ten best films of 2018, unlikely as that may seem.|Fresh
A solid, emotionally rich sequel that builds upon the Creed legacy.|Fresh
Creed II is absent of both the topically political atmosphere of Rocky IV and the bravura action of Ryan Coogler's Creed.|Rotten
For Creed II to do a Creed style dramatic exploration of the aftermath of pure '80s cheese is a bold move, and a successful one.|Fresh
I loved this movie, for so many different reasons...it could have gone so wrong, so cheesy, but instead it turned into something that's a franchise.|Fresh
A very capable sequel to a very popular movie.|Fresh
Creed II does not give us anything but another, slightly superior Rocky sequel. It wins on points. Just don't expect a knockout.|Fresh
It's a familiar sequel in which audiences will be able to anticipate every single narrative punch.|Rotten
Creed II is to Creed what the Rocky sequels are to the original: a more generic, less textured take on familiar boxing movie tropes. The difference, it seems, is Coogler.|Fresh
Creed II is much like the annoying boxing match announcer that infects most of the movie: trying too hard to sound exciting while not telling you anything new or interesting|Rotten
A knockout sequel that packs the same impacting punch as its predecessor.|Fresh
This sequel accomplishes its modest goals, and yet what's frustrating about this latest chapter in the Adonis Creed saga is that, whatever ambitions it might have, the primary objective is to fashion a familiar Rocky adventure.|Rotten
The rift is part of the rather transparent and predictable structure of Creed II, which feels more like an indifferent Rocky sequel than a movie with the reinvented dynamism of Creed.|Rotten
Creed II is exactly what you want from a Rocky/Creed film: it's engaging, emotional, gripping, and entertaining, pushing the characters forward in all the right ways.|Fresh
I love watching the relationship between Ivan and Victor as they try to restore their families names.|Fresh
It's a state of emotional stymieing that Jordan pulls off well, particularly in light of a heavy-handed script.|Fresh
The only thing driving the story forward is the strength of Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, and Sylvester Stallone's performances, but they're nearly lost in a sea of missed opportunities.|Fresh
Can't live up to the legacy even of the previous Creed movie, let alone any of the Rocky movies, when it relies so heavily on every predictable boxing clich√© imaginable.|Rotten
It's depressing that after Creed's success, Creed II feels like it's just a step above a straight-to-video knockoff, designed to get a little more from the first movie's audience but not to increase it.|Rotten
Nothing here has been freshly thought out, nor is there a drop of surprise as to the story's trajectory, forcing the viewer to tolerate conventional emotional beats and stale plot contrivances.|Rotten
Sometimes the movie feels torn between spare evocations of a boxer's life and crowd-pleasing evocations of past movies. But more often than not, Caple splits the difference with aplomb.|Fresh
It's not quite as smart as Creed, or quite as beautiful, and it doesn't have as much depth or nuance or texture. But it's got enough to deliver something satisfying and sweet.|Fresh
The Land director Steven J. Caple Jr. has made a rousing tale about fathers and sons, guilt and redemption, loneliness and family - just the sort of big, sledgehammer-subtle themes that have always propelled the series.|Fresh
"""Creed II"" elevates the literal and metaphorical challenges of following up improbable success to something meaningful and eventually transcendent of the formulas that it relies upon."|Fresh
"""Creed II"" may not be the freshest entry in the franchise, but it's a solid sports drama that makes the most of its soulful young star, Michael B. Jordan."|Fresh
"We know what to expect from these stories, but both ""Creed"" and its sequel invite us to forget - so we can rediscover the thrill all over again."|Fresh
"Caple orchestrates a worthy sequel that still has those needed references to the ""Rocky"" franchise the fans crave, but makes a point to build up Adonis' own story."|Fresh
Jordan remains a model of dimensional ferocity, laced with the right vulnerability.|Fresh
For a movie that features a dramatic fight between people with the last name Creed and Drago, it's strangely sad and reflective.|Fresh
Very much a Rocky sequel.|Fresh
Creed II is serviceable and enjoyable even if one can see the punches coming from a mile away.|Fresh
"""Creed II"" has been made with heart and skill, and Jordan invests each moment with such fierce conviction that he makes it all seem like it matters."|Fresh
Elevated by a central trio of winning performances and a director who provides equal weight to drama in and out of the ring, Creed II deserves to be cheered.|Fresh
The rare sequel that doesn't wind up feeling like the same old mistake.|Fresh
