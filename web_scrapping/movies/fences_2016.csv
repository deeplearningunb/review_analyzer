For all its impressive dialogue and exemplary performances, Fences left me...well...on the fence.|Rotten
As purely a thespian venture, the Denzel Washington starring and directed Fences is an applaudable homer.|Fresh
Fences ultimately rests on the shoulders of Washington and Davis, who are at the top of their game.|Fresh
Most of the performances are good and August Wilson's screenplay shines at times. But the flat, blatant direction, the unsubtle storytelling and Mykelti Williamson's performance just inspired me to want to build a fence around it.|Rotten
This is a movie featuring capital A acting with lengthy, wordy impassioned monologues and impressive performances but never once does Fences feel the least bit cinematic.|Rotten
Fences is a powerful piece of work, and Washington channels that power mostly effectively. Viewers may (or may not) have questions about some of the interpretation, but we come out moved all the same.|Fresh
Simple yet passionate adaptation of August Wilson's masterpiece that is respectful to its source material providing incredible performances and great dialogue throughout.|Fresh
Often overpowered by Washington's forceful turn, Fences struggles with a bad case of thematic redundancy... The film also fails to define a cinematic rhythm separate from Wilson's doozy of a script.|Rotten
Wilson's dialogue is superlative -- soulful, authentic and timely and almost musical, sharing a cadence that's part of most urban cities. Under Washington's direction and Christensen's cinematography, there is no wasted moment, no empty frame.|Fresh
Directed by Denzel Washington, who also appears in the movie as its lead, Fences offers a startlingly detailed look into the Black relationship - and touches upon the destructive nature of Black masculinity, particularly when it involves the Black woman.|Fresh

In Rose [Viola Davis], Fences reveals so beautifully and effectively the quiet power of cinema.|Fresh
Everyone delivers the letter above A game. Every micro expression feels thought out, and as big of a presence Washington has, he still has to contend with the scene stealing antics of Viola Davis, who more than gives him a run for his money.|Fresh
[Washington's] performance and direction are generous and sensitive.|Fresh
On a stage, dialogue as symbol can work. Movies require something more natural for audiences to lose themselves in -- something Fences doesn't manage.|Fresh
Denzel Washington and Viola Davis give incredible performances, which is reason enough to forgive the film's cinematic shortcomings.|Fresh
... Washington and Davis tear into their roles with what might be career-best and definitely Oscar-worthy performances.|Fresh
It does have some wonderful and touching moments, but as a whole, Fences is a couple of palings short.|Rotten
Wilson's powerful story, which encompasses not just love, sex, race, oedipal clashes, betrayal and death, but even music and sport, has the scope of a Great American Novel. Washington and company do it justice.|Fresh
Makes sure to remind us that we are all human and make mistakes, all of which usually come at the expense of our own personal failures|Fresh
Viola Davis sets her own sky-high bar higher than ever. She has several of the film's most powerful monologues, and her emotions are so raw and so naked that they are utterly unforgettable.|Fresh
Fences is one of the most prescient movies out now.|Fresh
Based on the Tony-winning Broadway play of the same name, Fences is just as powerful on the big screen.|Fresh
August Wilson's shattering Broadway drama gets a soulful interpretation.|Fresh
With an abundance of baseball references, Fences, which also outstays its welcome, is likely to struggle to win over British audiences.|Rotten
Fences comes to the stage almost entirely intact, including Wilson's beautiful language and scenery-chewing monologues, and as Troy [Denzel] Washington does some of his finest acting work in recent memory.|Fresh
That may be Washington's greatest accomplishment in bringing it to the screen - allowing hope to rise from circumstances that are less than hopeful.|Fresh
It's a meaty tour-de-force of comic camaraderie, defiance, disillusion, and chutzpah, that [Denzel] Washington delivers con brio-and it's only the first 10 minutes of the movie.|Fresh
Balancing the joys of the script that turned Wilson's play into a multi award-winning juggernaut with a desire to adapt such a play for Hollywood is a fine line, but sadly it is one that Denzel is unable to straddle.|Fresh
. . .Denzel and Viola embody truly astonishing depictions of this couple, acting at the highest level of perfection even in slight reaction shots or minor movements, and as director Denzel captures these details.|Fresh
A visually monotonous film that, however, ends up mesmerizing thanks to a remarkable cast of actors. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Denzel Washington, well, swings for the fences. And while he doesn't quite hit a home run, he does manage a solid triple. And, almost as importantly, he brilliantly eases himself through the transition from leading man to character actor/star.|Fresh
The performances by each of its six main characters... combined with Washington's gripping direction (inciting a mix of terror, madness, and pity), FENCES is simply extraordinary. It is not to be missed.|Fresh
It's Washington's third directorial effort and, as in his previous films, the camera serves the actors. He remains true to the play...|Fresh
the power of the story lies not in its tragedy, but in how it finds the good in the bad, the seed of hope in the moments of despair, the strength of character in those most deeply and fundamentally flawed|Fresh
As with many such family dramas, Davis' Rose is the foundation - and the scene in which she expresses betrayal may well be the movie's best. The rest of the cast, including Washington himself, is very nearly her equal.|Fresh
All that being said, Washington and Viola Davis - reprising their 2010 Broadway roles - are so damn good and the supporting cast is so solid, Fences is worth seeing for the acting alone.|Fresh
The bare-bones aesthetic means the film functions as a showcase for its cast, with Washington and Davis outsizing their environs with vivid grandiosity.|Fresh
Fences abandons itself too much to reproduce its texts with grandiloquence but sacrifices much of the emotion and dramatic depth in the way. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film which tone fails to prepare the viewer for a final camera movement that should rise to the transcendent, not the kitsch. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A gritty drama about frustration and racial determinism in which Washington stands as the overall responsibility. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
Above all else, this is an actor's showcase.|Fresh
A film that emphasizes the work of its two protagonists, especially Denzel Washington's performance. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
"The epilogue of the story, which probably works very well on stage, when presented in a more subtle way, simply doesn't work on the big screen. ""Fences"" is a powerful but failed drama. [Full review in Spanish]"|Fresh
Fences is a poignant domestic drama that takes its time and seldom cuts corners, the dialogue sprawling and spiking in a way that seems much better suited to the stage than what we are used to seeing on the snackable big screen.|Fresh
The film is Denzel Washington's showpiece and for a good while it is hard not to be swept up in his striking commitment to Troy's erratic and hateful mind.|Fresh
A simple synopsis film (about the life of an African-American family in the late 50's), but full of contradictory and complex characters, with nuances that speak of a time that goes and another that comes. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A film whose tone ends up being theatrical, in the most verbose, and less cinematographic, sense of the word. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
This is clearly an impressive piece of work, but it borders on self-indulgence and its appeal is not that broad.|Fresh
All one can do in my position is to reiterate just how powerful a piece of cinema this truly is.|Fresh
Denzel swells with dangerous charisma. Viola works high emotion from every one of her many lines. They are so good they almost convince us we're watching a movie.|Fresh
There is a powerful drama here about the legacy of racism but Washington doesn't know how to liberate it from the stage.|Rotten
There's a universality to the Maxson's story that is sure to resonate with audiences everywhere and I found myself moved to tears more than once.|Fresh
As a result some of the themes of Wilson's text and its baseball metaphors do not quite hit a home run. Still, it is essential viewing because the acting hits it out of the park.|Fresh
A storm-level cinematic trip with powerhouse performances, you don't just watch Fences. You experience it.|Fresh
Washington's performance is a sight to see all on its own, and when Davis roars into life in the second half she's unstoppable.|Fresh
On stage, this would no doubt be powerful stuff but Washington the director has done little to open up the drama and adapt it for the big screen.|Rotten
The symbolism is heavy handed. It's like being repeatedly clobbered by Troy's prized baseball bat: Rose takes a phone call that delivers bad news; a lightning flash illuminates the crucifix on her wall.|Rotten
The inordinate length of the piece and the constantly descending tone of the drama results in an ultimately heavy, draining experience from a director who should have been braver in breaking out of the constraints of its stage origins.|Rotten
One of the pleasures of Fences is seeing Washington's dominant technique - that swaggering walk, the hardening of his voice when challenged - get batted back by the visceral force of Davis' performance.|Fresh
The script is so robust and important, and hugely relevant to everyone in the audience, that it demands to be seen.|Fresh
Every viewer will be able to relate to one aspect or another.|Fresh
[Washington and Davis] first performed August Wilson's play on Broadway in 2010 to rave reviews and Tony awards. Their deep knowledge of their characters shows.|Fresh
As it is, we are able to enjoy a theatrical experience, and some really fine acting, with minimal obvious changes made to the original stage production.|Fresh
It is funny, albeit typically in the most uncomfortable, end-of-your-tether fashion, and the fraught humour does mostly survive the unnecessary 162 minute running time.|Fresh
This is a portrait of a doomed marriage that allows its stars to explode.|Fresh
Fences is the most classical piece of drama in the best picture line-up for this year's Oscars, with outstanding performances by Denzel Washington and Viola Davis.|Fresh
[Washington] has a terrific cast at his disposal.|Fresh
Washington treats the source material with a little too much reverence, although his commanding presence fills the screen.|Fresh
Fences is filled with lengthy speeches that soar and glide like a bird in flight and there is a poetry in the everyday struggles of these ordinary lives.|Fresh
You need to go into this for the love of great acting and superb writing. Do that and you'll be rewarded.|Fresh
Washington and co-lead Viola Davis deliver Wilson's loquacious dialogue with such dazzling force that their combined screen presence renders any thoughts about the cinematic limitations of his approach obsolete.|Fresh
Denzel Washington is a class act, and he has given us a classy piece of work.|Fresh
Fences is a filmed play that never seems anything else: a yatter of life of death, directed by Denzel Washington from August Wilson's Pulitzer-winning 1983 play.|Rotten
Washington is customarily magnetic, but this is Davis' film.|Fresh
The great coup Washington delivers, beyond framing his co-star's virtuous anguish so well, is the risky, brilliant, and frequently alienating performance he gives as Troy.|Fresh
Fences is an important tale of humanity, responsibility, self-sacrifice and error told from the perspective of lives that have been occluded from the grand narrative.|Fresh
It's the Backyard Acting Olympics.|Fresh
Denzel as director never feels fully in control of the material, but Fences shines in its performances and pithy dialogue.|Fresh
There is no doubting the power and the fury charging through the work of Washington -- who also directs here -- and a few of his most compelling speeches rank as true master classes in wielding the spoken word as a weapon.|Fresh
This feels more like a record of a stage performance than a film in its own right. That, though, doesn't lessen its impact in the slightest or take away from the searing brilliance of the two leads.|Fresh
The music of the dialogue, with Davis and Washington at the peak of their powers, makes the whole thing sing.|Fresh
Given this is based on a stage play, naturally this film is fundamentally about speech, and the dialogue is beautifully crafted and rhythmically delivered, with a collection of quite remarkable monologues, and indelible two-handers.|Fresh
Denzel Washington and Viola Davis excel in a well-crafted drama that's sure to bring the late August Wilson's words to a much wider audience.|Fresh
This is a work full of sensitivity, humour and wisdom, enacted with ferocious passion.|Fresh
As hard hitting as a baseball whose game acts as a metaphor for the protagonist's life, Fences is a potent drama about survival, family and dreams - with sublime performances ...This is an emotional experience you will not want to miss!|Fresh
This is a terrific drama that highlights what has changed over the past 60 years and what has remained the same.|Fresh
A film that, beyond a real cinematographic montage, depends more on the monophonic montage rhythms of which a vital but dark Denzel Washingto takes over. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
A simply extraordinary film without crashes, bangs and wallops but full of towering performances delivered with intelligence, power and heart.|Fresh
A film full of humor, sparkling conversations, emotional intensity and drama. [Full review in Spanish]|Fresh
The stunning acting and August Wilson's timeless words will captivate you again and again.|Fresh
The performances are on the large side, but they're of an extremely high quality, and emotionally rending.|Fresh
Get it? Gabriel with his trumpet? Man, you ain't even listening.|Rotten
Working with a screenplay by playwright August Wilson, Denzel Washington crafts a fine film as a director, opening up the once stage set drama and giving each actor a place to share their story|Fresh
This film isn't about Black pain or the struggle of being economically disenfranchised. This movie is about real life which just so happens to be filled with Black fully actualized characters that have depth and grace.|Fresh
Fences is a family story with a local scope, but like Troy, it swings for the fences and carries a crushing weight that casts a long shadow.|Fresh
Fences is a conservative movie - which is unfortunate artistically and interesting politically.|Fresh
Wilson's text is a phenomenally layered character study and acting showcase. And Washington, Davis, and most of their co-stars are more than up for it.|Fresh
If Fences occasionally feels cinematically inert, it's emotionally resonant thanks to Davis and Washington the actor, not the director as much.|Fresh
Fences will surely garner Oscar nominations for the screenplay and actor performances.|Fresh
"While it does fully overcome the demands of transition from stage to screen, ""Fences"" soars on the performances by Denzel Washington and Viola Davis."|Fresh
While Denzel Washington's direction might leave a little to be desired, his acting has never been more relentless and fierce.|Fresh
Washington's direction can't match his acting - 'Fences' is great filmed theater but not exactly great cinema. But there's no questioning Washington's skill as an actor's director, and the ensemble is first-rate, particularly Davis.|Fresh
Formidable drama, depicting the essential African-American experience, featuring authentic, award-worthy performances from Viola Davis and Denzel Washington.|Fresh
... a powerhouse of a drama ... Washington is breathtakingly good as the embittered Troy, who's erecting a wall between himself and an unjust world. Viola Davis can prepare her Oscar speech|Fresh
Wilson would be pleased with Washington's smooth, hot-blooded handling of it, unapologetically putting all those fiery emotions out there for the whole world to see.|Fresh
Fences is an actors' showcase above all else, and all of the talent on display is exemplary.|Fresh
His Troy Maxon breaks away from this commercial work. It's the performance of the year, and maybe the performance of Washington's career.|Fresh
The great miracle of Fences...is how Denzel Washington transmits the pain and frustration of his character through one of Hollywood's most radiant smiles.|Fresh
Davis was also Tony-nominated in the 2010 Broadway production, and her performance is a searing look at a woman standing by a man who often doesn't seem to deserve her.|Fresh
[Washington and Davis' performances], both prior Tony winners and now nominated for Golden Globes, will be remembered as two of 2016's very best.|Fresh
The film is a triumph of expanded stagecraft and cinematic vision thanks to the skill and conscientiousness of director Denzel Washington.|Fresh
The filmmaking is fluid and patient and tasteful-in-a-good-way, and the images captured by cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen convey a modern American mythology without resorting to sepia-toned shtick.|Fresh
A riveting meditation on pride, family and personal weakness. It's not the kind of film you forget easily.|Fresh
Fences struggles to make the leap from the stage to the big screen, but is kept afloat by the powerhouse performances of its leads.|Fresh
Denzel Washington is the man.|Fresh
It is so refreshing to have a film where the dialogue is rich and full-bodied.|Fresh
Fences is a stirring chronicle of a family struggling with pressures within and without. Wilson's commentary on race remains, sadly, as potent as ever.|Fresh
If Fences was doomed to be made into an awards-season prestige picture, I really can't imagine how it could have turned out more satisfying than this.|Fresh
Washington's direction leaves Fences feeling powerful yet inert.|Fresh
What carries this screen version of Wilson's work is the ability of these actors to keep our attention hostage for two-plus hours and make us feel for these characters, even when we don't always believe the words they say.|Fresh
Fences lives so firmly in the realm of real people that it humiliates the bulk of today's noisy and superficial flicks.|Fresh
Phenomenal movie based on the Pulitzer-Prize-winning play.|Fresh
It's incredible that it has taken this long to put an August Wilson play on the screen. This movie redresses that, and its performances are wholly worthy of such a quintessentially American playwright. We're privileged to have them.|Fresh
Washington, Davis Shine in Fences.|Fresh
...depicts a man whose entire world exists in a tug-of-war between the Civil War and Civil Rights.|Fresh
Both Davis and Washington honor these characters by thoroughly inhabiting their emotional flesh.|Fresh
These performances are killer, the source material is smart, and there's a lesson beneath the heavy-handedness that makes it worth the endeavor|Fresh
It's an evocative and powerful glimpse into the volatile dynamics of a working-class family that touches on some raw emotions in its darker moments, and to its credit, isn't always easy to watch as a result.|Fresh
It's a testament to the movie's soaring performances that they are able to elicit interest and evoke strong emotions despite Fences' aesthetic deficiencies.|Fresh
A poignant screen adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play in which Denzel Washington stokes the fire in his belly.|Fresh
Washington and Davis can do no wrong. They roam free and Fences can barely contain them.|Fresh
Denzel Washington brilliantly translates August Wilson's Pulitzer-Prize-winning play to the big screen.|Fresh
Whets our appetite for when [more] of Wilson's plays receive this deserved treatment as a great playwright...to indelibly commit such rich characters to multidimensional life|Fresh
Even when Washington's Troy becomes an unbearable pain, you remain intoxicated with Wilson's mastery of dialogue and turn of phrase. It's almost musical, like a great jazz band riffing in harmonic bliss.|Fresh
'Fences' is historically significant, but more importantly it remains dramatically powerful, and this fastidious yet vibrant film ensures that nothing has been lost in its translation to the screen.|Fresh
The words, written for the screen by Wilson before his death in 2005 and spit out by a mostly bitter garbage man (Washington), are as racially relevant today as they were in its '50s story. The ensemble acting is damn powerful, too.|Fresh
Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are nothing short of remarkable.|Fresh
You'll find no better performance by an actor and actress this year than by Denzel and Viola, and no better ensemble anywhere.|Fresh
Bringing Wilson's plays to wider audiences is a good thing. Fences preserves the drama, if not quite translating it into film.|Fresh
"Leans about 95 percent on ""point the camera at the actors and let them act."" But what actors-and what acting. (Splice Today)"|Fresh
With rhythmic threads of poetry in its DNA, and a soul forged of the blues, Fences is a sad portrait of an oversized man with even bigger emotions.|Fresh
A moving and urgent portrait of a working-class African-American family in 1950s Pittsburgh powered by tour de force performances by its two leads.|Fresh
It's a privilege to watch Washington and Davis lay it all on the line.|Fresh
Washington has done Wilson proud, the veteran actor swatting this one right out of the ballpark, knocking the cover off of the ball in the process.|Fresh
Unsurprisingly, the cast is magnificent.|Fresh
Based on the 1983 August Wilson play, Fences is little more than a filmed version of the 2010 Broadway revival. It all but throws up house lights during intermission.|Fresh
Washington has never been better. Davis is so good she could play a -- no pun intended -- fence post and get award nominations. A Christmas Day movie present worth the wait.|Fresh
The film is the next best thing to seeing a stage production of this 20th-century classic. Its power, compassion and intimacy crashes through the screen and into your heart.|Fresh
Your best bet is to let those mellifluous, multitudinous words bewitch, bother, and beguile you; then maybe you won't notice the stagey presentation, slight story, and occasional emotional overreach.|Fresh
Both Washington and Davis scale their performances somewhere between stage and screen, and in his role a director, Washington clearly keeps allegiance with the rapid-fire exchanges in Wilson's text.|Fresh
Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are go-at-it, toe-to-toe heavyweight champions. They are incredible, and Fences is special.|Fresh
Incredible performances all around, and Wilson's play is given a reverential big screen adaptation.|Fresh
This is remarkable, powerful stuff that's only somewhat diluted by the necessary compromises movies demand of plays.|Fresh
The masterful thing about Denzel Washington's direction here is that he doesn't exactly open up the play. Instead, he opens up the visual frame around the players.|Fresh
"If you want to watch some powerhouse performances in a well-told film about masculinity and family dynamics from a bygone era, ""Fences"" is for you. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"|Fresh
This is one of [Denzel Washington's] most accomplished performances.|Fresh
"Ringing with both ancient wisdom and searing relevance, ""Fences"" feels as if it's been crafted for the ages, and for this very minute."|Fresh
Although Fences can be charitably viewed as a star vehicle for the actor-director - and he does reach for the rafters in certain parts, so loud and proud is his performance - it is Davis who walks away with the production.|Fresh
"""Fences"" is an effective drama, but it feels rigid, its stage origins handicapping its storytelling."|Fresh
If Fences barely escapes the confines of its titular enclosure, the performances all sound to the skies like Gabriel's trumpet.|Fresh
Wilson's play is such an extraordinary social statement, its bitter patriarch rivaling Willy Loman in the greatness of his smallness.|Fresh
Feels entirely stage-bound and artificial, with set design and performances that might make sense for live theater, but which feel stilted and ineffective onscreen.|Rotten
August Wilson's towering play has been magnificently put on screen by director/star Denzel Washington, with an incendiary performance by Viola Davis.|Fresh
Fences crackles with spitfire dialogue, blazing emotions, and worn-down, gut-punched humanity.|Fresh
Serious or not, many films are merely entertainments and are easily forgotten, even if they succeed. But a serious film such as Fences is a privilege to see, not just as a dramatic entertainment but because it reverberates long after it ends.|Fresh
Only Davis manages to keep her responses sounding fresh and free of stagecraft. But her character, much like the audience, simply ends up maxed out on Troy Maxson.|Rotten
Washington has brought Wilson's work to a larger audience than would have seen the live theatrical performance, and for that alone deserves great credit.|Fresh
"""Fences"" wraps you and whirls you in a heady cyclone of words, ultimately dropping you gently on the ground, moved and changed and unexpectedly uplifted by the journey."|Fresh
Some plays lend themselves to the cinema better than others. Unfortunately, Fences doesn't seem to be one of them.|Rotten
Fences is still a gripping watch, but it's gripping for the reasons the play has always been gripping: the language and performances.|Fresh
"Intimacy is a challenge for ""Fences,"" but the acting is expectedly dynamic, with raw nerve work from the leads carrying the feature through a few rough patches of storytelling."|Fresh
Washington makes his character both sympathetic and pathetic, a tragic character of almost Shakespearian proportions grappling with fate, family responsibilities, work, racial injustice and carnal desires.|Fresh
Heartening, though, it is in almost every way.|Fresh
Watching it is like getting a front-row seat to the beautifully mounted revival of a classic work of American drama, starring two stars who know and understand that text as well as any actors in the world.|Fresh
"""Fences"" is perhaps best appreciated as a showcase for the brilliant acting of Washington and Davis. Their performances are virtually guaranteed to garner Oscar nominations."|Fresh
Magnificent|Fresh
The entire cast is worthy of praise and, in Davis' case, beyond it: Her downcast eyes speak volumes.|Fresh
"You don't get groundbreaking cinema from ""Fences,"" but what you do get - two titanic performances and an immeasurable American drama - makes up for that."|Fresh
"As the lead actor, [﻿Washington] takes on a giant's role and is almost too big for it. Here is a new definition of ""frighteningly good."""|Fresh
Fences is old-school Americana that's driven by dynamite performances all around, albeit a bit stuffy in nature.|Fresh
Washington's work as director and actor along with the amazing cast delivers Wilson's story in a proper and impressive style.|Fresh
Fences may never lose the look and sound of a play, but Washington's close-up focus on the characters only heightens the dignity Wilson bestowed on them.|Fresh
one of 2016's defining movie moments|Fresh
"""Fences"" is a feast of brilliant acting, in a story that's sometimes as difficult as it is powerful."|Fresh
Tragic, beautiful, thought-provoking.|Fresh
By themselves, [the actors] make the movie worth seeing, though in the end, it feels too much like a school assignment.|Fresh
Washington's performance -- as big as it gets -- is all wrong for the movies, where even a self-aggrandizing character like Troy Maxson, a former Negro Leagues star ballplayer turned '50s Pittsburgh garbageman, needs to be scaled back to feel realistic.|Fresh
The intensity of the bonds between the actors here, forged when many of them starred together on Broadway, deepens the ache of this tragic tale and makes this Fences so formidable.|Fresh
Washington and Davis' performances... invite us in to an intimate place that's messy and painful and hard to shake. It's as good as screen acting gets.|Fresh
[Washington] tells a big story that is comfortably, convincingly set in a humble backyard -- albeit a backyard cluttered with the heavy stone of human drama.|Fresh
Fences boasts sterling performances and deep characterization even as it struggles to get away from its stage roots.|Fresh
Fences is a portrait of ordinary people fumbling toward compassion and courage under the shadow of extraordinary injustice, disenfranchisement, and self-doubt.|Fresh
Powerful adaptation of August Wilson's intense play.|Fresh
Refreshing familiar roles which are obviously second nature to them, Denzel and Viola deliver emotionally-provocative performances likely to garner Academy Award nominations in Oscar season.|Fresh
The people in charge, on screen and off, know what they have here, and they don't get material like this very often in their careers.|Fresh
Washington delivers not only one of the year's best performances, but one of the best self-directed performances in cinema history.|Fresh
Fences is a labor of love and attention must be paid. You don't get writing or acting of this caliber every day, and in this particularly dreary year of second-rate everything, this movie is something special.|Fresh
For a first-timer, the film would be an achievement. For Washington, it's further proof of his indelibility as an actor.|Fresh
As director and star of this powerful adaptation of August Wilson's canonical play, Denzel Washington plays a brash talker masking a world of misery and secrets, with an unforgettable pathos.|Fresh
Washington gives a magnetic, layered performance, backed by a largely superb cast, most of whom reprise their roles from the Broadway revival of Wilson's classic.|Fresh
A brilliant, deeply human adaptation of a masterwork.|Fresh
The musicality of Washington's voice as he turns interrogative, the repetitions and the needling, make Troy an intimidating force even when he's all bluster.|Fresh
Electrifying performances from Denzel Washington, Viola Davis and a stunning cast-enacting one of the great 20th century American plays-make Fences a must-see|Fresh
It may be dialogue driven but Denzel Washington's vision of a Fences film version is fully realized in this superbly acted movie of the late, great August Wilson's Pulitizer Prize and Tony winning play.|Fresh
The word tour de force is an overused critical clich, but it's the only appropriate one here. But there's more to the movie than its actors.|Fresh
Washington's approach gives Wilson's extraordinary words and rich metaphorical story the platform they deserve.|Fresh
Fences is an admirable, exceptionally well-acted new directorial effort from Denzel Washington.|Fresh
"I respect [Washington] for not attempting to ""open up"" the play just to make it seem more ""cinematic."""|Fresh
A film that bursts with a conversational energy and burning intensity that only comes with familiarity with the source material.|Fresh
With the level of acting talent involved, Fences could have been filmed in the parking lot of a pet store and still been just as effective.|Fresh
Fences demands to be seen if for no other than reason than Washington and Davis. They're at the top of their game reprising roles that rightfully earned them Tonys for their work. Now they deserve Oscars.|Fresh
Fences is moviemaking as public service, like PBS's Masterpiece Theater: an accessible adaptation of a necessary literary work that few will ever have the opportunity to see onstage.|Fresh
It will not come as a news flash that Mr. Washington is a movie star of the first rank... what he does here is both sizzling and subtle, a star performance that does equal justice to the play's poetry and kitchen-sink reality.|Fresh
"I doubt if many other will identify, as closely as I, with the characters in ""Fences"" but the believably rooted family drama will keep the viewer enrapt."|Fresh
In bringing August Wilson to the screen for the first time, director-star Washington does the playwright proud by refusing to slice Fences into small pieces and serve it to short attention spans|Fresh
Washington's role is obviously meaty, and he plunges into it with a mix of swagger and vulnerability. But it's Davis, not surprisingly, who really shakes the rafters, in a performance tailor-made for her.|Fresh
Fences is a scathing study of how white society destroys a promising black man's sense of self.|Fresh
There's a musicality, a rat-a-tat rhythm to August Wilson's patter, that you lose when you simply read his work. You need to see them mounted to get the full effect.|Fresh
The combination of top acting and the powerful rhythm of the language in the drama's celebrated high spots absolutely holds us.|Fresh
"Even as it properly foregrounds Wilson's dialogue - few playwrights have approached his genius for turning workaday vernacular into poetry - ""Fences"" is much more than a filmed reading."|Fresh
Dialogue that might work onstage feels artificial on film, and Wilson's symbols come across as clunky and obvious, especially when there's not much to look at.|Rotten
It ... stands as an aching, lyrical, performance-driven masterpiece in its own right, a film so intense and engrossing that movie houses really should screen it with an intermission.|Fresh
"Honorable, worthy and windy, ""Fences"" is essentially a PBS episode of ""Great Performances"" that is inflated for the big screen without ever quite belonging there."|Fresh
Fences may be a cautionary story about the effects of racism, but it is also a cunning, layered and consistently entertaining drama.|Fresh
It's not a movie, not really. It's a filmed play. But what a play. What a story. And what a pair of stars.|Fresh
Under Washington's earnest but plain direction, scenes of loose-limbed riffing ... soar above the drama's conspicuous mechanisms and symbolism.|Fresh
Give Viola Davis her Oscar!|Fresh
